are an abundant source of diphotons, and a narrow Higgs boson signal at relatively low masses will appear as a

W e see that the resummation is essen tial not only for the predi tion of ph ysi al QT distributions in pro du tion, but also for redible estimates of the e e ts of exp erimen tal a eptan e on distributions in the diphoton in v arian t mass and other v ariables.

In this academic chunk, the authors discuss the simulation of experimental isolation using an auxiliary regulator. Their approach attempts to replicate the integrated QCD rate obtained in the DIPHOX calculation at small QT, for the nominal EisoT. The chunk also highlights two forms of the auxiliary regulator considered below. The first involves subtracting the leading collinear contribution and smoothing one isolation. The second method suppresses fragmentation contributions at EisoT by rejecting events in the R cone that satisfy the condition r, where r is a smooth function satisfying 0, R < EisoT. The authors also compare the two prescriptions, noting differences and similarities in their outcomes. From this academic chunk, three concise search queries were generated:

CONCLUSIONS The theoreti al study of on tin uum diphoton pro du tion in hadron ollisions is in teresting and v aluable for sev eral reasons there are data from the CDF and D ollab orations at F ermilab with the promise of larger ev en t samples there are new theoreti al hallenges asso iated with all orders soft gluon resummation of t w o lo op amplitudes and on tin uum diphotons are a large standard mo del ba kground ab o v e whi h one ma y observ e the pro du ts of Higgs b oson de a y in to a pair of photons at the LHC.

Our basi QCD hard s attering subpro esses are all omputed at next to leading order NLO in the strong oupling strength s , and w e in lude the state of art resummation of initial state gluon radiation to all orders in s , v alid to next to next to leading logarithmi a ura y NNLL . Resummation is essen tial for a realisti and reliable al ulation of the QT dep enden e in the region of small and in termediate v alues of QT , where the ross se tion is greatest. It is also needed for stable estimates of the e e ts of 30 exp erimen tal a eptan e on distributions in the diphoton in v arian t mass and other v ariables. Our analyti al results are in luded in a fully up dated ResBos o de 31, 32 . This n u meri al program allo ws us to imp ose sele tions on the transv erse momen ta and angles of the nal photons, in order to mat h those emplo y ed b y the CDF and D ollab orations, as w ell as those an ti ipated in exp erimen ts at the LHC. Our predi tions are esp e ially p ertinen t in the region QT Q.

Chunk: a fragmen tation on tribution of en tirely di eren t nature arises when the pair is relativ ely ligh t and pro du ed from fragmen tation of one parton, as dis ussed in Se s.

In the w ork rep orted here, w e are guided b y our in terest in des ribing the ross se tion for isolate d photons, in whi h the fragmen tation on tributions are largely suppressed. A t ypi al isolation ondition requires the hadroni a tivit y to b e minimal e.g., omparable to the underlying ev en t in the immediate neigh b orho o d of ea h andidate photon. Candidate photons an b e reje ted b y energy dep osit nearb y in the hadroni alorimeter or the presen e of hadroni tra ks near the photons. A theory al ulation ma y appro ximate the exp erimen tal isolation b y requiring the full energy of the hadroni remnan ts to b e less than a threshold isolation energy Eiso T in a one of size R around ea h photon. The t w o photons m ust b e also separated in the plane of the rapidit y and azim uthal angle b y an amoun t ex eeding the resolution R of the dete tor. The v alues of Eiso T , R , and R serv e as rude hara teristi s of the a tual measuremen t. The magnitude of the nal state fragmen tation on tribution dep ends on the assumed v alues of Eiso T , R , and R . An additional ompli ation arises when the fragmen tation radiation is assumed to b e exa tly ollinear to the photon s momen tum, as implied b y the photon fragmen tation fun tions D z . The ollinear appro ximation onstrains from b elo w the v alues of z a essible to D z . The size of the fragmen tation on tribution ma y dep end strongly on the v alues of Eiso T and zmin as a onsequen e of rapid v ariation of D z with z .

Chunk: to x using this same procedure. Finally, slide pebbles along the path from the original endpoints v to u specified by the successor array s v , s s v , ... The correctness of Algorithm 18 comes from the fact that it is implementing the shortcut construction. Efficiency comes from the fact that instead of potentially moving the pebble back and forth, Algorithm 18 pre computes a canonical path crossing each edge of H at most three times once in the initial depth first search, and twice while converting the initial path to a canonical one. It follows that each accepted edges takes O n time, for a total of O n2 time spent processing edges in H. Although we have not discussed this explicity, for the algorithm to be efficient we need to maintain components as in . After each accepted edge, the components of H can be updated in time O n . Finally, the results of show that the rejected edges take an amortized O time each. 16 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Summarizing, we have shown that the canonical pebble game with colors solves the decom position problem in time O n2 . 9. An important special case Rigidity in dimension 2 and slider pinning In this short section we present a new application for the special case of practical importance, , . As discussed in the introduction, Laman s theorem characterizes minimally rigid graphs as the 2,3 tight graphs. In recent work on slider pinning, developed after the current paper was submitted, we introduced the slider pinning model of rigidity . Com binatorially, we model the bar slider frameworks as simple graphs together with some loops placed on their vertices in such a way that there are no more than 2 loops per vertex, one of each color. We characterize the minimally rigid bar slider graphs as graphs that are 1. 2,3 sparse for subgraphs containing no loops. 2. 2,0 tight when loops are included. We call these graphs 2,0,3 graded tight, and they are a special case of the graded sparse graphs studied in our paper . The connection with the pebble games in this paper is the following. Corollary 19 Pebble games and slider pinning . In any 2,3 pebble game graph, if we replace pebbles by loops, we obtain a 2,0,3 graded tight graph. Proof. Follows from invariant I3 of Lemma 7. In , we study a special case of slider pinning where every slider is either vertical or horizontal. We model the sliders as pre colored loops, with the color indicating x or y direction. For this axis parallel slider case, the minimally rigid graphs are characterized by 1. 2,3 sparse for subgraphs containing no loops. 2. Admit a 2 coloring of the edges so that each color is a forest i.e., has no cycles , and each monochromatic tree spans exactly one loop of its color. This also has an interpretation in terms of colored pebble games. Corollary 20 The pebble game with colors and slider pinning . In any canonical 2,3 pebble game with colors graph, if we replace pebbles by loops of the same color, we obtain the graph of a minimally pinned axis parallel bar slider framework. Proof. Follows from Theorem 4, and Lemma 12. 10. Conclusions and open problems We presented a new characterization of k,l sparse graphs, the pebble game with colors, and used it to give an efficient algorithm for finding decompositions of sparse graphs into edge disjoint trees. Our algorithm finds such sparsity certifying decompositions in the upper range and runs in time O n2 , which is as fast as the algorithms for recognizing sparse graphs in the upper range from . We also used the pebble game with colors to describe a new sparsity certifying decomposi tion that applies to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions

Chunk: 17 We defined and studied a class of canonical pebble game constructions that correspond to either a maps and trees or proper lTk decomposition. This gives a new proof of the Tutte Nash Williams arboricity theorem and a unified proof of the previously studied decomposition cer tificates of sparsity. Canonical pebble game constructions also show the relationship between the l 1 pebble condition, which applies to the upper range of l, to matroid union augmenting paths, which do not apply in the upper range. Algorithmic consequences and open problems. In , Gabow and Westermann give an O n3 2 algorithm for recognizing sparse graphs in the lower range and extracting sparse subgraphs from dense ones. Their technique is based on efficiently finding matroid union augmenting paths, which extend a maps and trees decomposition. The O n3 2 algorithm uses two subroutines to find augmenting paths cyclic scanning, which finds augmenting paths one at a time, and batch scanning, which finds groups of disjoint augmenting paths. We observe that Algorithm 17 can be used to replace cyclic scanning in Gabow and Wester mann s algorithm without changing the running time. The data structures used in the implemen tation of the pebble game, detailed in are simpler and easier to implement than those used to support cyclic scanning. The two major open algorithmic problems related to the pebble game are then Problem 1. Develop a pebble game algorithm with the properties of batch scanning and obtain an implementable O n3 2 algorithm for the lower range. Problem 2. Extend batch scanning to the l 1 pebble condition and derive an O n3 2 pebble game algorithm for the upper range. In particular, it would be of practical importance to find an implementable O n3 2 algorithm for decompositions into edge disjoint spanning trees.

Chunk: w. It follows that any sparse graph has a pebble game construction. Theorem 1 Sparse graphs and pebble game graphs coincide . A graph G is k,l sparse with 0 l 2k 1 if and only if G is a pebble game graph. 6. The pebble game with colors decomposition In this section we prove Theorem 2, which characterizes all pebble game decompositions. We start with the following lemmas about the structure of monochromatic connected components in H, the directed graph maintained during the pebble game. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions 9 Lemma 10 Monochromatic pebble game subgraphs are 1,0 sparse . Let Hi be the sub graph of H induced by edges with pebbles of color ci on them. Then Hi is 1,0 sparse, for ,...,k. Proof. By I4 Hi is a set of edges with out degree at most one for every vertex. Lemma 11 Tree pieces in a pebble game graph . Every subgraph of the directed graph H in a pebble game construction contains at least lmonochromatic tree pieces, and each of these is rooted at either a vertex with a pebble on it or a vertex that is the tail of an out edge. Recall that an out edge from a subgraph H V ,E is an edge vw with v V and vw E . Proof. Let H V ,E be a non empty subgraph of H, and assume without loss of generality that H is induced by V . By I3 , out V peb V l. We will show that each pebble and out edge tail is the root of a tree piece. Consider a vertex v V and a color ci. By I4 there is a unique monochromatic directed path of color ci starting at v. By I5 , if this path ends at a pebble, it does not have a cycle. Similarly, if this path reaches a vertex that is the tail of an out edge also in color ci i.e., if the monochromatic path from v leaves V , then the path cannot have a cycle in H . Since this argument works for any vertex in any color, for each color there is a partitioning of the vertices into those that can reach each pebble, out edge tail, or cycle. It follows that each pebble and out edge tail is the root of a monochromatic tree, as desired. Applied to the whole graph Lemma 11 gives us the following. Lemma 12 Pebbles are the roots of trees . In any pebble game configuration, each pebble of color ci is the root of a possibly empty monochromatic tree piece of color ci. Remark Haas showed in that in a lTk , a subgraph induced by n 2 vertices with m edges has exactly kn m tree pieces in it. Lemma 11 strengthens Haas result by extending it to the lower range and giving a construction that finds the tree pieces, showing the connection between the l 1 pebble condition and the hereditary condition on proper lTk . We conclude our investigation of arbitrary pebble game constructions with a description of the decomposition induced by the pebble game with colors. Theorem 2 The pebble game with colors decomposition . A graph G is a pebble game graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge disjoint subgraphs such that each is 1,0 sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ltree pieces of the 1,0 sparse graphs in the decomposition. Proof. Let G be a pebble game graph. The existence of the k edge disjoint 1,0 sparse sub graphs was shown in Lemma 10, and Lemma 11 proves the condition on subgraphs. For the other direction, we observe that a color ci with ti tree pieces in a given subgraph can span at most n ti edges summing over all the colors shows that a graph with

Chunk: a pebble game decomposition must be sparse. Apply Theorem 1 to complete the proof. Remark We observe that a pebble game decomposition for a Laman graph may be read out of the bipartite matching used in Hendrickson s Laman graph extraction algorithm . Indeed, pebble game orientations have a natural correspondence with the bipartite matchings used in . 10 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Maps and trees are a special case of pebble game decompositions for tight graphs if there are no cycles in lof the colors, then the trees rooted at the corresponding lpebbles must be spanning, since they have n 1 edges. Also, if each color forms a forest in an upper range pebble game decomposition, then the tree pieces condition ensures that the pebble game de composition is a proper lTk. In the next section, we show that the pebble game can be specialized to correspond to maps and trees and proper lTk decompositions. 7. Canonical Pebble Game Constructions In this section we prove the main theorems Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 , continuing the inves tigation of decompositions induced by pebble game constructions by studying the case where a minimum number of monochromatic cycles are created. The main idea, captured in Lemma 15 and illustrated in Figure 6, is to avoid creating cycles while collecting pebbles. We show that this is always possible, implying that monochromatic map graphs are created only when we add more than k n 1 edges to some set of n vertices. For the lower range, this implies that every color is a forest. Every decomposition characterization of tight graphs discussed above follows immediately from the main theorem, giving new proofs of the previous results in a unified framework. In the proof, we will use two specializations of the pebble game moves. The first is a modi fication of the add edge move. Canonical add edge When performing an add edge move, cover the new edge with a color that is on both vertices if possible. If not, then take the highest numbered color present. The second is a restriction on which pebble slide moves we allow. Canonical pebble slide A pebble slide move is allowed only when it does not create a monochromatic cycle. We call a pebble game construction that uses only these moves canonical. In this section we will show that every pebble game graph has a canonical pebble game construction Lemma 14 and Lemma 15 and that canonical pebble game constructions correspond to proper lTk and maps and trees decompositions Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 . We begin with a technical lemma that motivates the definition of canonical pebble game constructions. It shows that the situations disallowed by the canonical moves are all the ways for cycles to form in the lowest lcolors. Lemma 13 Monochromatic cycle creation . Let v V have a pebble p of color ci on it and let w be a vertex in the same tree of color ci as v. A monochromatic cycle colored ci is created in exactly one of the following ways M1 The edge vw is added with an add edge move. M2 The edge wv is reversed by a pebble slide move and the pebble p is used to cover the reverse edge vw. Proof. Observe that the preconditions in the statement of the lemma are implied by Lemma 7. By Lemma 12 monochromatic cycles form when the last pebble of color ci is removed from a connected monochromatic subgraph. M1 and M2 are the only ways to do this in a pebble game construction, since the color of an edge only changes when it is inserted the first time or a new pebble is put on it by a pebble slide move.

Chunk: is anomalously high because the tidal force is close to a resonance in the response function of ocean Brush 1983 . Kagan gave a detailed review about those tidal friction models Kagan 1997 . Those models are based on many assumptions about geological continental position and drifting and physical conditions in the past, and many parameters such as phase lag angle, multi mode approximation with time dependent frequencies of the resonance modes, etc. have to be introduced and carefully adjusted to make their predictions close to the geological evidence. However, those assumptions and parameters are still challenged, to certain extent, as concoction. The second possible scenario is that another mechanism could dominate the evolution of the Earth Moon system and the role of the tidal friction is not significant. In the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society, University of California at Riverside, the author proposed a dark matter field fluid model Pan 2005 with a non Newtonian approach, the current Moon and Earth data agree with this model very well. This paper will demonstrate that the past evolution of Moon Earth system can be described by the dark matter field fluid model without any assumptions 3 about past geological and physical conditions. Although the subject of the evolution of the Earth Moon system has been extensively studied analytically or numerically, to the author s knowledge, there are no theories similar or equivalent to this model. 2. Invisible matter In modern cosmology, it was proposed that the visible matter in the universe is about 2 10 of the total matter and about 90 98 of total matter is currently invisible which is called dark matter and dark energy, such invisible matter has an anti gravity property to make the universe expanding faster and faster. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, the evolution of the universe should be dominated by the physical mechanism of such invisible matter, such physical mechanism could be far beyond the current Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics, and the Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics could reflect only a corner of the iceberg of the greater physics. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, it should be more reasonable to think that such dominant invisible matter spreads in everywhere of the universe the density of the invisible matter may vary from place to place in other words, all visible matter objects should be surrounded by such invisible matter and the motion of the visible matter objects should be affected by the invisible matter if there are interactions between the visible matter and the invisible matter. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, the size of the particles of the invisible matter should be very small and below the 4 detection limit of the current technology otherwise, it would be detected long time ago with such dominant amount. With such invisible matter in mind, we move to the next section to develop the dark matter field fluid model with non Newtonian approach. For simplicity, all invisible matter dark matter, dark energy and possible other terms is called dark matter here. 3. The dark matter field fluid model In this proposed model, it is assumed that 1. A celestial body rotates and moves in the space, which, for simplicity, is uniformly filled with the dark matter which is in quiescent state relative to the motion of the celestial body. The dark matter possesses a field property and a fluid property it can interact with the celestial body with its fluid and field properties therefore, it can have energy exchange with the celestial body, and affect the motion of the celestial body. 2. The fluid property follows the general principle of fluid mechanics. The dark matter field fluid particles

Chunk: may be so small that they can easily permeate into ordinary baryonic matter i. e., ordinary matter objects could be saturated with such dark matter field fluid. Thus, the whole celestial body interacts with the dark matter field fluid, in the manner of a sponge moving thru water. The nature of the field property of the dark matter field fluid is unknown. It is here assumed that the interaction of the field associated with the dark matter field fluid with the celestial body is proportional to the mass of the celestial body. The dark matter field fluid is assumed to have a repulsive force against the gravitational force towards baryonic matter. The nature and mechanism of such repulsive force is unknown. 5 With the assumptions above, one can study how the dark matter field fluid may influence the motion of a celestial body and compare the results with observations. The common shape of celestial bodies is spherical. According to Stokes s law, a rigid non permeable sphere moving through a quiescent fluid with a sufficiently low Reynolds number experiences a resistance force F rv F , r is the radius of the sphere, and is the fluid viscosity constant. The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 1 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. For a rigid sphere moving through the dark matter field fluid, due to the dual properties of the dark matter field fluid and its permeation into the sphere, the force F may not be proportional to the radius of the sphere. Also, F may be proportional to the mass of the sphere due to the field interaction. Therefore, with the combined effects of both fluid and field, the force exerted on the sphere by the dark matter field fluid is assumed to be of the scaled form mv r F where n is a parameter arising from saturation by dark matter field fluid, the r1 n can be viewed as the effective radius with the same unit as r, m is the mass of the sphere, and is the dark matter field fluid constant, which is equivalent to . The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 2 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. The force described by Eq. 2 is velocity dependent and causes negative acceleration. According to Newton s second law of motion, the equation of motion for the sphere is mv r dt dv m Then 6 exp 1 0 vt r v v 6 where v0 is the initial velocity of the sphere. If the sphere revolves around a massive gravitational center, there are three forces in the line between the sphere and the gravitational center the gravitational force, the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force of the dark matter field fluid. The drag force in Eq. 3 reduces the orbital velocity and causes the sphere to move inward to the gravitational center. However, if the sum of the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force is stronger than the gravitational force, then, the sphere will move outward and recede from the gravitational center. This is the case of interest here. If the velocity change in Eq. 3 is sufficiently slow and the repulsive force is small compared to the gravitational force and centripetal acceleration force, then the rate of receding will be accordingly relatively slow. Therefore, the gravitational force and the centripetal acceleration force can be approximately treated in equilibrium at any time. The pseudo equilibrium equation is R mv R GMm 2 , M is the mass of the gravitational center, and R is the radius of the orbit. Inserting v of Eq. 4 into Eq. 5 yields 12 exp 1 2 0 t r v GM R or 12 exp 1 0 t r R R where 2 0 0 v GM . Note that R exponentially increases with time.

Chunk: the following recurrence relation for the number ak n 2 of acyclic automata of size n on a k letter input alphabet k 1 ak n n 1 X 1 n j 1 n j j 1 k n j ak j , n 1. A source is a vertex with no incoming edges. A finite acyclic automaton has at least one source because a path traversed backward v1 v2 v3 . . . must have distinct vertices and so cannot continue indefinitely. An automaton is single source or initially connected if it has only one source. Let Bk n denote the set of single source acyclic finite SAF automata on a k letter input alphabet with vertices 1, 2, . . ., n 1 where 1 is the source and n 1 is the sink, and set bk n Bk n . The two line representation of an automaton in Bk n is the 2 kn matrix whose columns list the edges in order. For example, ! is in B3 and the source to sink paths in B include 1 a 2 a 6, 1 b 4 c 3 a 6, 1 b 4 b 5 b 2 b 6, where the alphabet is . Proposition 1. The number bk n of SAF automata of size n on a k letter input alphabet n, k 1 is given by bk n n X 1 n i n 1 i 1 i 1 k n i ak i Remark This formula is a bit more succinct than the the recurrence in 1, Theorem 3.2 . Proof Consider the set A of acyclic automata with transient vertices n in which 1 is a source. Call 2, 3, . . ., n the interior vertices. For X 2, n , let f X automata in A whose set of interior vertices includes X, g X automata in A whose set of interior vertices is precisely X. Then f X P Y X Y 2,n g Y and by M obius inversion on the lattice of subsets of 2, n , g X P Y X Y 2,n X, Y f Y where X, Y is the M obius function for this 3 lattice. Since X, Y 1 Y X if X Y , we have in particular that g X Y 2,n 1 Y f Y . Let Y n i so that 1 i n. When Y consists entirely of sources, the vertices in n 1 Y and their incident edges form a subautomaton with i transient states there are ak i such. Also, all edges from the n i vertices comprising Y go directly into n 1 Y i 1 k n i choices. Thus f Y i 1 k n i ak i . By definition, g is the number of automata in A for which 1 is the only source, that is, g bk n and the Proposition now follows from . An unlabeled SAF automaton is an equivalence class of SAF automata under relabeling of the interior vertices. Liskovets notes and we prove below that Bk n has no nontrivial automorphisms, that is, each of the n 1 ! relabelings of the interior vertices of B Bk n produces a different automaton. So unlabeled SAF automata of size n on a k letter alphabet are counted by 1 n 1 !bk n . The next result establishes a canonical representative in each relabeling class. Proposition 2. Each equivalence class in Bk n under relabeling of interior vertices has size n 1 ! and contains exactly one SAF automaton with the last occurrences increas ing property the last occurrences of the interior vertices 2, 3, . . ., n in the bottom row of its two line representation occur in that order. Proof The first assertion follows from the fact that the interior vertices of an au tomaton

Chunk: B bk n can be distinguished intrinsically, that is, independent of their labeling. To see this, first mark the source, namely 1, with a mark new label v1 and observe that there exists at least one interior vertex whose only incoming edge s are from the source the only currently marked vertex for otherwise a cycle would be present. For each such interior vertex v, choose the last edge from the marked vertex to v using the built in ordering of these edges. This determines an order on these vertices mark them in order v2, v3, . . . , vj j 2 . If there still remain unmarked interior vertices, at least one of them has incoming edges only from a marked vertex or again a cycle would be present. For each such vertex, use the last incoming edge from a marked vertex, where now edges are arranged in order of initial vertex vi with the built in order breaking ties, to order and 4 mark these vertices vj 1, vj 2, . . .. Proceed similarly until all interior vertices are marked. For example, for ! , , namely 4, whose only incoming edge is from the source, and so . Now all incoming edges to both 3 and 5 are from marked vertices and the last such edges built in order comes into play are 4 b 5 and 4 c 3 putting vertices 3, 5 in the order 5, 3. So 3. Finally, . This proves the first assertion. By construction of the vs, relabeling each interior vertex i with the subscript of its corresponding v produces an automaton in Bk n with the last occurrences increasing property and is the only relabeling that does so. The example yields 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 2 6 4 3 4 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 ! . Now let Ck n denote the set of canonical SAF automata in Bk n representing un labeled automata thus Ck n 1 n 1 !bk n . Henceforth, we identify an unlabeled au tomaton with its canonical representative. 3 Column Marked Subdiagonal Paths A subdiagonal k, n, p path is a lattice path of steps 1, 0 and 0, 1 , E for east and N for north, from 0, 0 to kn, p that never rise above the line .

Chunk: one. Table 1 contains the decomposition terminology used in this paper. The decomposition problem. We define the decomposition problem for sparse graphs as tak ing a graph as its input and producing as output, a decomposition that can be used to certify spar sity. In this paper, we will study three kinds of outputs maps and trees proper lTk decompositions and the pebble game with colors decomposition, which is defined in the next section. 2. Historical background The well known theorems of Tutte and Nash Williams relate the k,k tight graphs to the existence of decompositions into edge disjoint spanning trees. Taking a matroidal viewpoint, 4 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran 0 1 2 3 4 5 a 0 1 2 3 4 5 b 0 1 2 3 4 5 c Fig. 2. a A graph with a 3T2 decomposition one of the three trees is a single vertex in the bottom right corner. b The highlighted subgraph inside the dashed countour has three black tree pieces and one gray tree piece. c The highlighted subgraph inside the dashed countour has three gray tree pieces one is a single vertex and one black tree piece. Edmonds gave another proof of this result using matroid unions. The equivalence of maps and trees graphs and tight graphs in the lower range is shown using matroid unions in , and matroid augmenting paths are the basis of the algorithms for the lower range of . In rigidity theory a foundational theorem of Laman shows that 2,3 tight Laman graphs correspond to generically minimally rigid bar and joint frameworks in the plane. Tay proved an analogous result for body bar frameworks in any dimension using k,k tight graphs. Rigidity by counts motivated interest in the upper range, and Crapo proved the equivalence of Laman graphs and proper 3T2 graphs. Tay used this condition to give a direct proof of Laman s theorem and generalized the 3T2 condition to all lTk for k l 2k 1. Haas studied lTk decompositions in detail and proved the equivalence of tight graphs and proper lTk graphs for the general upper range. We observe that aside from our new pebble game with colors decomposition, all the combinatorial characterizations of the upper range of sparse graphs, including the counts, have a geometric interpretation . A pebble game algorithm was first proposed in as an elegant alternative to Hendrick son s Laman graph algorithms . Berg and Jordan , provided the formal analysis of the pebble game of and introduced the idea of playing the game on a directed graph. Lee and Streinu generalized the pebble game to the entire range of parameters 0 l 2k 1, and left as an open problem using the pebble game to find sparsity certifying decompositions. 3. The pebble game with colors Our pebble game with colors is a set of rules for constructing graphs indexed by nonnegative integers k and l. We will use the pebble game with colors as the basis of an efficient algorithm for the decomposition problem later in this paper. Since the phrase with colors is necessary only for comparison to , we will omit it in the rest of the paper when the context is clear. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions 5 We now present the pebble game with colors. The game is played by a single player on a fixed finite set of vertices. The player makes a finite sequence of moves a move consists in the addition and or orientation of an edge. At any moment of time, the state of the game is captured by a directed graph H, with colored pebbles on vertices and edges. The edges of H are colored by the pebbles on them. While playing the pebble game all edges are directed, and we use the notation vw to indicate a directed edge from v to w. We describe the pebble game with

Chunk: colors in terms of its initial configuration and the allowed moves. a b Fig. 3. Examples of pebble game with colors moves a add edge. b pebble slide. Pebbles on vertices are shown as black or gray dots. Edges are colored with the color of the pebble on them. Initialization In the beginning of the pebble game, H has n vertices and no edges. We start by placing k pebbles on each vertex of H, one of each color ci, for ,2,...,k. Add edge with colors Let v and w be vertices with at least l 1 pebbles on them. Assume w.l.o.g. that v has at least one pebble on it. Pick up a pebble from v, add the oriented edge vw to E H and put the pebble picked up from v on the new edge. Figure 3 a shows examples of the add edge move. Pebble slide Let w be a vertex with a pebble p on it, and let vw be an edge in H. Replace vw with wv in E H put the pebble that was on vw on v and put p on wv. Note that the color of an edge can change with a pebble slide move. Figure 3 b shows examples. The convention in these figures, and throughout this paper, is that pebbles on vertices are represented as colored dots, and that edges are shown in the color of the pebble on them. From the definition of the pebble slide move, it is easy to see that a particular pebble is always either on the vertex where it started or on an edge that has this vertex as the tail. However, when making a sequence of pebble slide moves that reverse the orientation of a path in H, it is sometimes convenient to think of this path reversal sequence as bringing a pebble from the end of the path to the beginning. The output of playing the pebble game is its complete configuration. Output At the end of the game, we obtain the directed graph H, along with the location and colors of the pebbles. Observe that since each edge has exactly one pebble on it, the pebble game configuration colors the edges. We say that the underlying undirected graph G of H is constructed by the k,l pebble game or that H is a pebble game graph. Since each edge of H has exactly one pebble on it, the pebble game s configuration partitions the edges of H, and thus G, into k different colors. We call this decomposition of H a pebble game with colors decomposition. Figure 4 a shows an example of a 2,2 tight graph with a pebble game decomposition. Let V,E be pebble game graph with the coloring induced by the pebbles on the edges, and let G be a subgraph of G. Then the coloring of G induces a set of monochromatic con 6 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran a b c Fig. 4. A 2,2 tight graph with one possible pebble game decomposition.

Such a monochromatic subgraph is called a map graph piece of G if it contains a cycle in G and a tree piece of G otherwise. The set of tree pieces of G is the collection of tree pieces induced by G . As with the corresponding definition for lTks, the set of tree pieces is defined relative to a specific sub graph in particular a tree piece may be part of a larger cycle that includes edges not spanned by G . The properties of pebble game decompositions are studied in Section 6, and Theorem 2 shows that each color must be 1,0 sparse. The orientation of the edges in Figure 4 a shows this. For example Figure 4 a shows a 2,2 tight graph with one possible pebble game decom position. The whole graph contains a gray tree piece and a black tree piece that is an isolated vertex. The subgraph in Figure 4 b has a black tree and a gray tree, with the edges of the black tree coming from a cycle in the larger graph. In Figure 4 c , however, the black cycle does not contribute a tree piece. All three tree pieces in this subgraph are single vertex gray trees. In the following discussion, we use the notation peb v for the number of pebbles on v and pebi v to indicate the number of pebbles of colors i on v. Table 2 lists the pebble game notation used in this paper. 4. Our Results We describe our results in this section. The rest of the paper provides the proofs. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions 7 Our first result is a strengthening of the pebble games of to include colors. It says that sparse graphs are exactly pebble game graphs. Recall that from now on, all pebble games discussed in this paper are our pebble game with colors unless noted explicitly. Theorem 1 Sparse graphs and pebble game graphs coincide . A graph G is k,l sparse with 0 l 2k 1 if and only if G is a pebble game graph. Next we consider pebble game decompositions, showing that they are a generalization of proper lTk decompositions that extend to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs. Theorem 2 The pebble game with colors decomposition . A graph G is a pebble game graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge disjoint subgraphs such that each is 1,0 sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ltree pieces of the 1,0 sparse graphs in the decomposition. The 1,0 sparse subgraphs in the statement of Theorem 2 are the colors of the pebbles thus Theorem 2 gives a characterization of the pebble game with colors decompositions obtained by playing the pebble game defined in the previous section. Notice the similarity between the requirement that the set of tree pieces have size at least lin Theorem 2 and the definition of a proper lTk. Our next results show that for any pebble game graph, we can specialize its pebble game construction to generate a decomposition that is a maps and trees or proper lTk . We call these specialized pebble game constructions canonical, and using canonical pebble game construc tions, we obtain new direct proofs of existing arboricity results. We observe Theorem 2 that maps and trees are special cases of the pebble game decompo sition both spanning trees and spanning map graphs are 1,0 sparse, and each of the spanning trees contributes at least one piece of tree to every subgraph. The case of proper lTk graphs is more subtle if each color in a pebble game decomposition is a forest, then we have

Chunk: found a proper lTk , but this class is a subset of all possible proper lTk decompositions of a tight graph. We show that this class of proper lTk decompositions is sufficient to certify sparsity. We now state the main theorem for the upper and lower range. Theorem 3 Main Theorem Lower Range Maps and trees coincide with pebble game graphs . Let 0 l k. A graph G is a tight pebble game graph if and only if G is a k,l maps and trees. Theorem 4 Main Theorem Upper Range Proper lTk graphs coincide with pebble game graphs . Let k l 2k 1. A graph G is a tight pebble game graph if and only if it is a proper lTk with kn ledges.

A graph G is tight if and only if has a k,l maps and trees decomposition. Corollary 6 Crapo , Haas . Let k l 2k 1. A graph G is tight if and only if it is a proper lTk .

Our last result improves on this, showing that a canonical pebble game construction, and thus 8 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran a maps and trees or proper lTk decomposition can be found using a pebble game algorithm in O n2 time and space. These time and space bounds mean that our algorithm can be combined with those of without any change in complexity. 5. Pebble game graphs In this section we prove Theorem 1, a strengthening of results from to the pebble game with colors. Since many of the relevant properties of the pebble game with colors carry over directly from the pebble games of , we refer the reader there for the proofs. We begin by establishing some invariants that hold during the execution of the pebble game. Lemma 7 Pebble game invariants . During the execution of the pebble game, the following invariants are maintained in H I1 There are at least lpebbles on V. I2 For each vertex v, span v out v peb v k. I3 For each V V, span V out V peb V kn . I4 For every vertex v V, outi v pebi v 1. I5 Every maximal path consisting only of edges with color ci ends in either the first vertex with a pebble of color ci or a cycle. Proof. I1 , I2 , and I3 come directly from . I4 This invariant clearly holds at the initialization phase of the pebble game with colors. That add edge and pebble slide moves preserve I4 is clear from inspection. I5 By I4 , a monochromatic path of edges is forced to end only at a vertex with a pebble of the same color on it. If there is no pebble of that color reachable, then the path must eventually visit some vertex twice. From these invariants, we can show that the pebble game constructible graphs are sparse. Lemma 8 Pebble game graphs are sparse . Let H be a graph constructed with the pebble game. Then H is sparse. If there are exactly lpebbles on V H , then H is tight. The main step in proving that every sparse graph is a pebble game graph is the following. Recall that by bringing a pebble to v we mean reorienting H with pebble slide moves to reduce the out degree of v by one. Lemma 9 The l 1 pebble condition . Let vw be an edge such that H vw is sparse. If peb l 1, then a pebble not on can be brought to either v or

Chunk: w. It follows that any sparse graph has a pebble game construction. Theorem 1 Sparse graphs and pebble game graphs coincide . A graph G is k,l sparse with 0 l 2k 1 if and only if G is a pebble game graph. 6. The pebble game with colors decomposition In this section we prove Theorem 2, which characterizes all pebble game decompositions. We start with the following lemmas about the structure of monochromatic connected components in H, the directed graph maintained during the pebble game. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions 9 Lemma 10 Monochromatic pebble game subgraphs are 1,0 sparse . Let Hi be the sub graph of H induced by edges with pebbles of color ci on them. Then Hi is 1,0 sparse, for ,...,k. Proof. By I4 Hi is a set of edges with out degree at most one for every vertex. Lemma 11 Tree pieces in a pebble game graph . Every subgraph of the directed graph H in a pebble game construction contains at least lmonochromatic tree pieces, and each of these is rooted at either a vertex with a pebble on it or a vertex that is the tail of an out edge. Recall that an out edge from a subgraph H V ,E is an edge vw with v V and vw E . Proof. Let H V ,E be a non empty subgraph of H, and assume without loss of generality that H is induced by V . By I3 , out V peb V l. We will show that each pebble and out edge tail is the root of a tree piece. Consider a vertex v V and a color ci. By I4 there is a unique monochromatic directed path of color ci starting at v. By I5 , if this path ends at a pebble, it does not have a cycle. Similarly, if this path reaches a vertex that is the tail of an out edge also in color ci i.e., if the monochromatic path from v leaves V , then the path cannot have a cycle in H . Since this argument works for any vertex in any color, for each color there is a partitioning of the vertices into those that can reach each pebble, out edge tail, or cycle. It follows that each pebble and out edge tail is the root of a monochromatic tree, as desired. Applied to the whole graph Lemma 11 gives us the following. Lemma 12 Pebbles are the roots of trees . In any pebble game configuration, each pebble of color ci is the root of a possibly empty monochromatic tree piece of color ci. Remark Haas showed in that in a lTk , a subgraph induced by n 2 vertices with m edges has exactly kn m tree pieces in it. Lemma 11 strengthens Haas result by extending it to the lower range and giving a construction that finds the tree pieces, showing the connection between the l 1 pebble condition and the hereditary condition on proper lTk . We conclude our investigation of arbitrary pebble game constructions with a description of the decomposition induced by the pebble game with colors. Theorem 2 The pebble game with colors decomposition . A graph G is a pebble game graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge disjoint subgraphs such that each is 1,0 sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ltree pieces of the 1,0 sparse graphs in the decomposition. Proof. Let G be a pebble game graph. The existence of the k edge disjoint 1,0 sparse sub graphs was shown in Lemma 10, and Lemma 11 proves the condition on subgraphs. For the other direction, we observe that a color ci with ti tree pieces in a given subgraph can span at most n ti edges summing over all the colors shows that a graph with

Chunk: a pebble game decomposition must be sparse. Apply Theorem 1 to complete the proof. Remark We observe that a pebble game decomposition for a Laman graph may be read out of the bipartite matching used in Hendrickson s Laman graph extraction algorithm . Indeed, pebble game orientations have a natural correspondence with the bipartite matchings used in . 10 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Maps and trees are a special case of pebble game decompositions for tight graphs if there are no cycles in lof the colors, then the trees rooted at the corresponding lpebbles must be spanning, since they have n 1 edges. Also, if each color forms a forest in an upper range pebble game decomposition, then the tree pieces condition ensures that the pebble game de composition is a proper lTk. In the next section, we show that the pebble game can be specialized to correspond to maps and trees and proper lTk decompositions. 7. Canonical Pebble Game Constructions In this section we prove the main theorems Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 , continuing the inves tigation of decompositions induced by pebble game constructions by studying the case where a minimum number of monochromatic cycles are created. The main idea, captured in Lemma 15 and illustrated in Figure 6, is to avoid creating cycles while collecting pebbles. We show that this is always possible, implying that monochromatic map graphs are created only when we add more than k n 1 edges to some set of n vertices. For the lower range, this implies that every color is a forest. Every decomposition characterization of tight graphs discussed above follows immediately from the main theorem, giving new proofs of the previous results in a unified framework. In the proof, we will use two specializations of the pebble game moves. The first is a modi fication of the add edge move. Canonical add edge When performing an add edge move, cover the new edge with a color that is on both vertices if possible. If not, then take the highest numbered color present. The second is a restriction on which pebble slide moves we allow. Canonical pebble slide A pebble slide move is allowed only when it does not create a monochromatic cycle. We call a pebble game construction that uses only these moves canonical. In this section we will show that every pebble game graph has a canonical pebble game construction Lemma 14 and Lemma 15 and that canonical pebble game constructions correspond to proper lTk and maps and trees decompositions Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 . We begin with a technical lemma that motivates the definition of canonical pebble game constructions. It shows that the situations disallowed by the canonical moves are all the ways for cycles to form in the lowest lcolors. Lemma 13 Monochromatic cycle creation . Let v V have a pebble p of color ci on it and let w be a vertex in the same tree of color ci as v. A monochromatic cycle colored ci is created in exactly one of the following ways M1 The edge vw is added with an add edge move. M2 The edge wv is reversed by a pebble slide move and the pebble p is used to cover the reverse edge vw. Proof. Observe that the preconditions in the statement of the lemma are implied by Lemma 7. By Lemma 12 monochromatic cycles form when the last pebble of color ci is removed from a connected monochromatic subgraph. M1 and M2 are the only ways to do this in a pebble game construction, since the color of an edge only changes when it is inserted the first time or a new pebble is put on it by a pebble slide move.

Chunk: is anomalously high because the tidal force is close to a resonance in the response function of ocean Brush 1983 . Kagan gave a detailed review about those tidal friction models Kagan 1997 . Those models are based on many assumptions about geological continental position and drifting and physical conditions in the past, and many parameters such as phase lag angle, multi mode approximation with time dependent frequencies of the resonance modes, etc. have to be introduced and carefully adjusted to make their predictions close to the geological evidence. However, those assumptions and parameters are still challenged, to certain extent, as concoction. The second possible scenario is that another mechanism could dominate the evolution of the Earth Moon system and the role of the tidal friction is not significant. In the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society, University of California at Riverside, the author proposed a dark matter field fluid model Pan 2005 with a non Newtonian approach, the current Moon and Earth data agree with this model very well. This paper will demonstrate that the past evolution of Moon Earth system can be described by the dark matter field fluid model without any assumptions 3 about past geological and physical conditions. Although the subject of the evolution of the Earth Moon system has been extensively studied analytically or numerically, to the author s knowledge, there are no theories similar or equivalent to this model. 2. Invisible matter In modern cosmology, it was proposed that the visible matter in the universe is about 2 10 of the total matter and about 90 98 of total matter is currently invisible which is called dark matter and dark energy, such invisible matter has an anti gravity property to make the universe expanding faster and faster. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, the evolution of the universe should be dominated by the physical mechanism of such invisible matter, such physical mechanism could be far beyond the current Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics, and the Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics could reflect only a corner of the iceberg of the greater physics. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, it should be more reasonable to think that such dominant invisible matter spreads in everywhere of the universe the density of the invisible matter may vary from place to place in other words, all visible matter objects should be surrounded by such invisible matter and the motion of the visible matter objects should be affected by the invisible matter if there are interactions between the visible matter and the invisible matter. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, the size of the particles of the invisible matter should be very small and below the 4 detection limit of the current technology otherwise, it would be detected long time ago with such dominant amount. With such invisible matter in mind, we move to the next section to develop the dark matter field fluid model with non Newtonian approach. For simplicity, all invisible matter dark matter, dark energy and possible other terms is called dark matter here. 3. The dark matter field fluid model In this proposed model, it is assumed that 1. A celestial body rotates and moves in the space, which, for simplicity, is uniformly filled with the dark matter which is in quiescent state relative to the motion of the celestial body. The dark matter possesses a field property and a fluid property it can interact with the celestial body with its fluid and field properties therefore, it can have energy exchange with the celestial body, and affect the motion of the celestial body. 2. The fluid property follows the general principle of fluid mechanics. The dark matter field fluid particles

Chunk: may be so small that they can easily permeate into ordinary baryonic matter i. e., ordinary matter objects could be saturated with such dark matter field fluid. Thus, the whole celestial body interacts with the dark matter field fluid, in the manner of a sponge moving thru water. The nature of the field property of the dark matter field fluid is unknown. It is here assumed that the interaction of the field associated with the dark matter field fluid with the celestial body is proportional to the mass of the celestial body. The dark matter field fluid is assumed to have a repulsive force against the gravitational force towards baryonic matter. The nature and mechanism of such repulsive force is unknown. 5 With the assumptions above, one can study how the dark matter field fluid may influence the motion of a celestial body and compare the results with observations. The common shape of celestial bodies is spherical. According to Stokes s law, a rigid non permeable sphere moving through a quiescent fluid with a sufficiently low Reynolds number experiences a resistance force F rv F , r is the radius of the sphere, and is the fluid viscosity constant. The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 1 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. For a rigid sphere moving through the dark matter field fluid, due to the dual properties of the dark matter field fluid and its permeation into the sphere, the force F may not be proportional to the radius of the sphere. Also, F may be proportional to the mass of the sphere due to the field interaction. Therefore, with the combined effects of both fluid and field, the force exerted on the sphere by the dark matter field fluid is assumed to be of the scaled form mv r F where n is a parameter arising from saturation by dark matter field fluid, the r1 n can be viewed as the effective radius with the same unit as r, m is the mass of the sphere, and is the dark matter field fluid constant, which is equivalent to . The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 2 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. The force described by Eq. 2 is velocity dependent and causes negative acceleration. According to Newton s second law of motion, the equation of motion for the sphere is mv r dt dv m Then 6 exp 1 0 vt r v v 6 where v0 is the initial velocity of the sphere. If the sphere revolves around a massive gravitational center, there are three forces in the line between the sphere and the gravitational center the gravitational force, the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force of the dark matter field fluid. The drag force in Eq. 3 reduces the orbital velocity and causes the sphere to move inward to the gravitational center. However, if the sum of the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force is stronger than the gravitational force, then, the sphere will move outward and recede from the gravitational center. This is the case of interest here. If the velocity change in Eq. 3 is sufficiently slow and the repulsive force is small compared to the gravitational force and centripetal acceleration force, then the rate of receding will be accordingly relatively slow. Therefore, the gravitational force and the centripetal acceleration force can be approximately treated in equilibrium at any time. The pseudo equilibrium equation is R mv R GMm 2 , M is the mass of the gravitational center, and R is the radius of the orbit. Inserting v of Eq. 4 into Eq. 5 yields 12 exp 1 2 0 t r v GM R or 12 exp 1 0 t r R R where 2 0 0 v GM . Note that R exponentially increases with time.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0005v1 math.CA 2 Apr 2007 FROM DYADIC TO WAEL ABU SHAMMALA AND ALBERTO TORCHINSKY Abstract. In this paper we show how to compute the norm , 0, using the dyadic grid. This result is a consequence of the description of the Hardy spaces Hp RN in terms of dyadic and special atoms. Recently, several novel methods for computing the BMO norm of a function f in two dimensions were discussed in . Given its importance, it is also of interest to explore the possibility of computing the norm of a BMO function, or more generally a function in the Lipschitz class , using the dyadic grid in RN. It turns out that the BMO question is closely related to that of approximating functions in the Hardy space H1 RN by the Haar system. The approximation in H1 RN by affine systems was proved in , but this result does not apply to the Haar system. Now, if HA R denotes the closure of the Haar system in H1 R , it is not hard to see that the distance d f, HA of f H1 R to HA is R 0 f x dx , see . Thus, neither dyadic atoms suffice to describe the Hardy spaces, nor the evaluation of the norm in BMO can be reduced to a straightforward computation using the dyadic intervals. In this paper we address both of these issues. First, we give a characterization of the Hardy spaces Hp RN in terms of dyadic and special atoms, and then, by a duality argument, we show how to compute the norm in RN , 0, using the dyadic grid. We begin by introducing some notations. Let J denote a family of cubes Q in RN, and Pd the collection of polynomials in RN of degree less than or equal to d. Given 0, Q J , and a locally integrable function g, let pQ g denote the unique polynomial in P such that g pQ g Q has vanishing moments up to order . For a locally square integrable function g, we consider the maximal function M ,2 ,J g x given by M ,2 ,J g x sup x Q, Q J 1 Q N 1 Q Z Q g y pQ g y 2 dy 1 2 . 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 42B30,42B35. 1 2 WAEL ABU SHAMMALA AND ALBERTO TORCHINSKY The Lipschitz space ,J consists of those functions g such that M ,2 ,J g is in L , g , ,2 ,J g when the family in question contains all cubes in RN, we simply omit the subscript J . Of course, . Two other families, of dyadic nature, are of interest to us. Intervals in R of the form In, k 1 2n, k2n , where k and n are arbitrary integers, positive, negative or 0, are said to be dyadic. In RN, cubes which are the product of dyadic intervals of the same length, i.e., of the form Qn, ,k1 In,kN , are called dyadic, and the collection of all such cubes is denoted D. There is also the family D0. Let I n, k 1 2n, k 1 2n , where k and n are arbitrary integers. Clearly I n,k is dyadic if k is odd, but not if k is even. Now, the collection I n,k n, k integers contains all dyadic intervals as well as the shifts k 1 2n 2n 1, k 2n 2n 1 of the dyadic intervals by their half length. In RN, put Q n,k Q n, n,k1 I n,kN Q n,k is called a special cube. Note that D0 contains D properly. Finally, given I n,k, let I L n, k 1 2n, k2n , and I R n, k2n, k 1 2n .

Queries:
1. What is the relationship between linear operator, quasinormed space, and BMO
2. How does the averaging process of the translates work in quasinormed space?
3. What is the significance of the Lipschitz class in a shifted dyadic grid?

In this article,

1. It is discussed that a linear operator from a quasinormed space into a Hilbert space, D, is bounded if and only if A T x c x X for every x x X. The process of averaging the translates of dyadic BMO functions in the quasinormed space X leads to BMO, which is of particular importance in obtaining results in BMO once they are known to be true in its dyadic counterpart, BMOd. This also highlights that BMO can be obtained as the intersection of BMOd and one of its shifted counterparts.

2. The concept of the process of averaging the translates works in quasinormed space by involving functions that are translated along the coordinate axis and are determined by the side length of the cube. The article explains this by saying, "the defining cube Q of p

An important dimensionless parameter is kF a 1. The BCS limit is indicated by kF a 1 1, the BEC limit corresponds to kF a 1 1, and the crossover occurs at kF a . Some integrals used are listed in the Appendix for reference. Using Eq. for uk and vk, we evaluate Eq. 14, 15 and Eq. 19, 20 . In Fig. 1 we plot the fraction of condensation in the gas, as a function of the dimen sionless parameter kF a 1. With either choice of k, the fraction goes to one in the BEC limit kF a 1 1. Notice that C C N is an appreciably higher fraction than C C N, showing a dominant condensation of atoms into the pair wave function defined in . The expectation value of the commutator C, C as a function of kF a 1 is shown in Fig. 2. Again both definitions of k give unity in the BEC limit, but Eq. is always closer to one than Eq. . Next we calculate the factor N 1 N. By solving Eq. numerically for k and k, we obtain the ratios N 1 N and N 1 N from Eq. . These ratios are shown in Fig. 3 as a function of kF a 1.

Chunk: rational func tion. We can immediately see that a direct implementa tion of the Hamiltonian is out of our reach, for the simple reason that, as we have seen, in the polymer representa tion we can either represent q or p, but not both! What has been done so far in the literature? The simplest thing possible approximate the non existing term by a well defined function that can be quantized and hope for the best. As we shall see in next sections, there is indeed more that one can do. At this point there is also an important decision to be made which variable q or p should be regarded as dis crete ? Once this choice is made, then it implies that the other variable will not exist if q is regarded as dis crete, then p will not exist and we need to approximate the kinetic term p2 2m by something else if p is to be the discrete quantity, then q will not be defined and then we need to approximate the potential V q . What hap pens with a periodic potential? In this case one would be modelling, for instance, a particle on a regular lattice such as a phonon living on a crystal, and then the natural choice is to have q not well defined. Furthermore, the po tential will be well defined and there is no approximation needed. In the literature both scenarios have been considered. For instance, when considering a quantum mechanical system in , the position was chosen to be discrete, so p does not exist, and one is then in the A type for the momentum polarization or the type B for the q polarization . With this choice, it is the kinetic term the one that has to be approximated, so once one has done this, then it is immediate to consider any potential that will thus be well defined. On the other hand, when con sidering loop quantum cosmology LQC , the standard choice is that the configuration variable is not defined . This choice is made given that LQC is regarded as the symmetric sector of full loop quantum gravity where the connection that is regarded as the configuration vari able can not be promoted to an operator and one can only define its exponentiated version, namely, the holon omy. In that case, the canonically conjugate variable, closely related to the volume, becomes discrete , just as in the full theory. This case is however, different from the particle in a potential example. First we could mention that the functional form of the Hamiltonian constraint that implements dynamics has a different structure, but the more important difference lies in that the system is constrained. Let us return to the case of the particle in a po tential and for definiteness, let us start with the aux iliary kinematical framework in which q is discrete, p can not be promoted and thus we have to approximate the kinetic term p2 2m. How is this done? The stan dard prescription is to define, on the configuration space C, a regular graph 0. This consists of a numerable set of points, equidistant, and characterized by a pa rameter 0 that is the constant separation between points. The simplest example would be to consider the set . This means that the basic kets that will be considered n will correspond precisely to labels n belonging to the graph 0, that is, 0. Thus, we shall only consider states of the form, X n bn n . This small Hilbert space H 0 , the graph Hilbert space, is a subspace of the large polymer Hilbert space Hpoly but it is separable. The condition for a state of the form to belong to the Hilbert space H 0 is that the co efficients bn satisfy P n bn . Let us

Chunk: now consider the kinetic term p2 2m. We have to approximate it by means of trigonometric functions, that can be built out of the functions of the form ei p . As we have seen in previous sections, these functions can indeed be promoted to operators and act as translation operators on the kets . If we want to remain in the graph , and not create new points , then one is con strained to considering operators that displace the kets by just the right amount. That is, we want the basic shift operator V to be such that it maps the ket with label n to the next ket, namely n 1 . This can in deed achieved by fixing, once and for all, the value of the allowed parameter to be 0. We have then, V 0 n n 0 n 1 which is what we wanted. This basic shift operator will be the building block for approximating any polynomial function of p. In order to do that we notice that the function p can be approximated by, p 0 sin 0 p 2i 0 ei 0 p e i 0 p where the approximation is good for p 0. Thus, one can define a regulated operator p 0 that depends on the scale 0 as p 0 n 2i 0 V 0 V 0 n i 2 0 n 1 n 1 In order to regulate the operator p2, there are at least two possibilities, namely to compose the operator p 0 8 with itself or to define a new approximation. The oper ator p 0 p 0 has the feature that shifts the states two steps in the graph to both sides. There is however an other operator that only involves shifting once p2 0 n 2 2 0 2 V 0 V 0 n 2 2 0 2 n n 1 n 1 which corresponds to the approximation p2 2 2 2 0 1 cos 0 p , valid also in the regime p 0. With these considerations, one can define the operator H 0, the Hamiltonian at scale 0, that in practice lives on the space H 0 as, H 0 1 2m p2 0 V q , that is a well defined, symmetric operator on H 0 . No tice that the operator is also defined on Hpoly, but there its physical interpretation is problematic. For example, it turns out that the expectation value of the kinetic term calculated on most states states which are not tailored to the exact value of the parameter 0 is zero. Even if one takes a state that gives reasonable expectation values of the 0 kinetic term and uses it to calculate the expectation value of the kinetic term corresponding to a slight perturbation of the parameter 0 one would get zero. This problem, and others that arise when working on Hpoly, forces one to assign a physical interpretation to the Hamiltonian H 0 only when its action is restricted to the subspace H 0 . Let us now explore the form that the Hamiltonian takes in the two possible polarizations. In the q polarization, the basis, labelled by n is given by the functions n q q, n. That is, the wave functions will only have sup port on the set 0. Alternatively, one can think of a state as completely characterized by the Fourier coeffi cients an q an, which is the value that the wave function q takes at the point 0. Thus, the Hamiltonian takes the form of a difference equation when acting on a general state q . Solving the time independent Schr odinger equation H E amounts to solving the difference equation for the coefficients an. The momentum polarization has a different structure. In this case, the operator p2 0 acts as a multiplication operator, p2 0 p 2 2

Chunk: idea in a concrete fashion. In particular, we shall need to replace the lattice with a decomposition of the real line in intervals having the lattice points as end points . Let us now consider a system in the polymer represen tation in which a particular lattice 0 was chosen, say with points of the form , namely a uniform lattice with spacing equal to a0. In this case, any Schr odinger wave function of the type that we consider will have a unique shadow on the lattice 0. If we refine the lattice 7 n by dividing each interval in 2n new intervals of length . Intu itively, by refining infinitely the graph we would recover the original function q . Even when at each finite step the corresponding shadow has a finite norm in the poly mer Hilbert space, the norm grows unboundedly and the 10 limit can not be taken, precisely because we can not em bed Hs into Hpoly. Suppose now that we are interested in the reverse process, namely starting from a polymer theory on a lattice and asking for the continuum wave function that is best approximated by a wave function over a graph. Suppose furthermore that we want to con sider the limit of the graph becoming finer. In order to give precise answers to these and other questions we need to introduce some new technology that will allow us to overcome these apparent difficulties. In the remaining of this section we shall recall these constructions for the benefit of the reader. Details can be found in which is an application of the general formalism discussed in . The starting point in this construction is the concept of a scale C, which allows us to define the effective the ories and the concept of continuum limit. In our case a scale is a decomposition of the real line in the union of closed open intervals, that cover the whole line and do not intersect. Intuitively, we are shifting the emphasis from the lattice points to the intervals defined by the same points with the objective of approximating con tinuous functions defined on R with functions that are constant on the intervals defined by the lattice. To be precise, we define an embedding, for each scale Cn from Hpoly to Hs by means of a step function X m man man q X m man m q Hs with n q a characteristic function on the interval man, m 1 an . Thus, the shadows living on the lattice were just an intermediate step in the con struction of the approximating function this function is piece wise constant and can be written as a linear com bination of step functions with the coefficients provided by the shadows. The challenge now is to define in an appropriate sense how one can approximate all the aspects of the theory by means of this constant by pieces functions. Then the strategy is that, for any given scale, one can define an effective theory by approximating the kinetic operator by a combination of the translation operators that shift between the vertices of the given decomposition, in other words by a periodic function in p. As a result one has a set of effective theories at given scales which are mutually related by coarse graining maps. This framework was developed in . For the convenience of the reader we briefly recall part of that framework. Let us denote the kinematic polymer Hilbert space at the scale Cn as HCn, and its basis elements as e i,Cn, where ian, i 1 an Cn. By construction this basis is orthonormal. The basis elements in the dual Hilbert space H Cn are denoted by i,Cn they are also orthonormal. The states i,Cn have a simple action on Cyl, i,Cn x0,q i,Cn x0 . That is, if x0 is in the interval i

Chunk: of Cn the result is one and it is zero if it is not there. Given any m n, we define d m,n H Cn H Cm as the coarse graining map between the dual Hilbert spaces, that sends the part of the elements of the dual basis to zero while keeping the information of the rest d m,n i,Cn j,Cm if , in the opposite case d m,n i,Cn 0. At every scale the corresponding effective theory is given by the hamiltonian Hn. These Hamiltonians will be treated as quadratic forms, hn HCn R, given by hn 2 Cn , Hn , where 2 Cn is a normalizaton factor. We will see later that this rescaling of the inner product is necessary in order to guarantee the convergence of the renormalized theory. The completely renormalized theory at this scale is obtained as hren m lim Cn R d m,nhn. and the renormalized Hamiltonians are compatible with each other, in the sense that d m,nhren . In order to analyze the conditions for the convergence in let us express the Hamiltonian in terms of its eigen covectors end eigenvalues. We will work with effec tive Hamiltonians that have a purely discrete spectrum labelled by Hn , ,Cn ,Cn. We shall also introduce, as an intermediate step, a cut offin the energy levels. The origin of this cut offis in the approximation of the Hamiltonian of our system at a given scale with a Hamiltonian of a periodic system in a regime of small energies, as we explained earlier. Thus, we can write h cut off cut off X 0 E ,Cm ,Cm ,Cm , where the eigen covectors ,Cm are normalized accord ing to the inner product rescaled by 1 2 Cn , and the cut offcan vary up to a scale dependent bound, cut off max Cm . The Hilbert space of covectors together with such inner product will be called H ren Cm . In the presence of a cut off, the convergence of the microscopically corrected Hamiltonians, equation is equivalent to the existence of the following two limits. The first one is the convergence of the energy levels, lim Cn R E , . Second is the existence of the completely renormalized eigen covectors, lim Cn R d m,n , ren ,Cm H ren Cm Cyl . We clarify that the existence of the above limit means that ren ,Cm x0,q is well defined for any x0,q Cyl. No tice that this point wise convergence, if it can take place 11 at all, will require the tuning of the normalization factors 2 Cn. Now we turn to the question of the continuum limit of the renormalized covectors. First we can ask for the existence of the limit lim Cn R ren ,Cn x0,q for any x0,q Cyl. When this limits exists there is a natural action of the eigen covectors in the continuum limit. Below we consider another notion of the continuum limit of the renormalized eigen covectors. When the completely renormalized eigen covectors exist, they form a collection that is d compatible, d m,n ren , ren ,Cm. A sequence of d compatible nor malizable covectors define an element of H ren R , which is the projective limit of the renormalized spaces of covec tors H ren R lim Cn R H ren Cn . The inner product in this space is defined by , ren R lim Cn R Cn, Cn ren Cn. The natural inclusion of C 0 in H ren R is by an antilinear map which assigns to any C 0 the d compatible collection shad Cn P i i L i H ren Cn Cyl shad Cn will be called the shadow of at scale Cn and acts in Cyl as a piecewise constant function. Clearly other types of test functions like Schwartz functions are also naturally included in H

Chunk: p representation and thus not square normalizable with respect to the polymer inner product, that in the p polarization is just given by the ordinary Haar measure on S1, and there is no quantization of the momentum its spectrum is still truly continuous . 13 Let us now consider the time dependent Schr odinger equation, i t p, t H p, t .

In the limit n , ECn when fixing the value of p . Let us write the proper covector as Cn, ren Cn H ren Cn . Then we can bring microscopic corrections to scale Cm and look for convergence of such corrections ren Cm . lim n d m,n Cn.

This expression defines the completely renormalized proper covector at the scale Cm. C. Polymer Quantum Cosmology In this section we shall present a version of quantum cosmology that we call polymer quantum cosmology. The idea behind this name is that the main input in the quan tization of the corresponding mini superspace model is the use of a polymer representation as here understood. Another important input is the choice of fundamental variables to be used and the definition of the Hamiltonian constraint. Different research groups have made differ ent choices. We shall take here a simple model that has received much attention recently, namely an isotropic, homogeneous FRW cosmology with . As we shall see, a proper treatment of the continuum limit of this system requires new tools under development that are beyond the scope of this work. We will thus restrict ourselves to the intro duction of the system and the problems that need to be solved. The system to be quantized corresponds to the phase space of cosmological spacetimes that are homogeneous and isotropic and for which the homogeneous spatial slices have a flat intrinsic geometry . The only matter content is a mass less scalar field . In this case the spacetime geometry is given by metrics of the form t dx2 dy2 dz2 where the function a t carries all the information and degrees of freedom of the gravity part. In terms of the coordinates a, pa, , p for the phase space of the the ory, all the dynamics is captured in the Hamiltonian con straint C 3 8 p2 a a 8 G p2 2 a 3 0 The first step is to define the constraint on the kine matical Hilbert space to find physical states and then a physical inner product to construct the physical Hilbert space.

The task becomes different as the system is now a constrained system with a constraint operator rather than a regular non-singular system with an ordinary Hamiltonian evolution.

Chunk: seen, for some simple examples such as a free particle and the harmonic oscillator one indeed recovers the Schr odinger description back. For other sys tems, such as quantum cosmological models, the answer is not as clear, since the structure of the space of classi cal solutions is such that the effective description intro duced by the polymer regularization at different scales is qualitatively different from the original dynamics. A proper treatment of these class of systems is underway and will be reported elsewhere . Perhaps the most important lesson that we have learned here is that there indeed exists a rich inter play between the polymer description and the ordinary Schr odinger representation. The full structure of such re lation still needs to be unravelled. We can only hope that a full understanding of these issues will shed some light in the ultimate goal of treating the quantum dynamics of background independent field systems such as general relativity.

Chunk: corner stone of the kinematics of the quantum theory they should be satisfied by the quantum system, when represented on a Hilbert space H. There are alternative points of departure for quantum kinematics. Here we consider the algebra generated by the exponentiated versions of q and p that are denoted by, U ei q V ei p where and have dimensions of momentum and length, respectively. The CCR now become U V e i V U and the rest of the product is U 1 U 2 U 1 2 V 1 V 2 V 1 2 The Weyl algebra W is generated by taking finite linear combinations of the generators U i and V i where the product is extended by linearity, X i Ai U i Bi V i From this perspective, quantization means finding an unitary representation of the Weyl algebra W on a Hilbert space H that could be different from the ordi nary Schr odinger representation . At first it might look weird to attempt this approach given that we know how to quantize such a simple system what do we need such a complicated object as W for? It is infinite dimensional, whereas the set , the starting point of the ordinary Dirac quantization, is rather simple. It is in the quantization of field systems that the advantages of the Weyl approach can be fully appreciated, but it is also useful for introducing the polymer quantization and comparing it to the standard quantization. This is the strategy that we follow. A question that one can ask is whether there is any freedom in quantizing the system to obtain the ordinary Schr odinger representation. On a first sight it might seem that there is none given the Stone Von Neumann unique ness theorem. Let us review what would be the argument for the standard construction. Let us ask that the repre sentation we want to build up is of the Schr odinger type, namely, where states are wave functions of configuration space q . There are two ingredients to the construction of the representation, namely the specification of how the basic operators q, p will act, and the nature of the space of functions that belongs to, that is normally fixed by the choice of inner product on H, or measure on R. The standard choice is to select the Hilbert space to be, R, dq 2 the space of square integrable functions with respect to the Lebesgue measure dq invariant under constant trans lations on R. The operators are then represented as, q q q q and p q i q q Is it possible to find other representations? In order to appreciate this freedom we go to the Weyl algebra and build the quantum theory thereon. The representation of the Weyl algebra that can be called of the Fock type involves the definition of an extra structure on the phase space a complex structure J. That is, a linear map ping from to itself such that . In 2 dimen sions, all the freedom in the choice of J is contained in the choice of a parameter d with dimensions of length. It is also convenient to define that has dimensions of 1 L. We have then, Jd q, k 7 d2 k, q d2 This object together with the symplectic structure q, p q , p q p p q define an inner product on by the formula gd Jd such that gd q, p q , p 1 d2 q q d2 2 p p which is dimension less and positive definite. Note that with this quantities one can define complex coordinates , as usual 1 d q id p 1 d q id p from which one can build the standard Fock representa tion. Thus, one can alternatively view the introduction of the length parameter d as the quantity needed

Chunk: limiting algebraic state becomes, B limd 0 d such that, B U 1 and B V ,0 From this positive linear function, one can indeed con struct the representation using the GNS construction. First let us note that the measure, even when the limit has to be taken with due care, behaves as d e q2 d2 dq 7 q dq That is, as Dirac s delta distribution. It is immediate to see that, in the d 7 0 limit, the inner product between the fundamental states q becomes, d 7 1 4 This in fact means that the vector belongs to the Kernel of the limiting inner product, so one has to mod out by these and all zero norm states in order to get the Hilbert space. Let us now analyze the other operator, namely the action of the operator V on the vacuum 0 q 1, which for arbitrary d has the form, V 0 q e d2 q 2 The inner product between two such states is given by 2 In the limit d 0, d , . We can see then that it is these functions that become the orthonormal, discrete basis in the theory. However, the function q in this limit becomes ill defined. For example, for 0, it grows unboundedly for 2, is equal to one if 2 and zero otherwise. In order to overcome these difficulties and make more transparent the resulting the ory, we shall consider the other form of the representation in which the measure is incorporated into the states and the resulting Hilbert space is L2 R, dq . Thus the new state q K V 0 q 1 d 1 2 e 1 2d2 q 2 We can now take the limit and what we get is lim d7 0 q 1 2 q, where by 1 2 q, we mean something like the square root of the Dirac distribution . What we really mean is an object that satisfies the following property 1 2 q, 1 2 q, q, , That is, if then it is just the ordinary delta, other wise it is zero. In a sense these object can be regarded as half densities that can not be integrated by themselves, but whose product can. We conclude then that the inner product is, Z R dq q q Z R dq q, , , which is just what we expected. Note that in this repre sentation, the vacuum state becomes 0 q 1 2 q, 0 , namely, the half delta with support in the origin. It is important to note that we are arriving in a natural way to states as half densities, whose squares can be integrated without the need of a nontrivial measure on the configu ration space. Diffeomorphism invariance arises then in a natural but subtle manner. Note that as the end result we recover the Kronecker delta inner product for the new fundamental states q 1 2 q, . Thus, in this new B polymer representation, the Hilbert space HB is the completion with respect to the inner product of the states generated by taking finite linear combinations of basis elements of the form q X i bi i q Let us now introduce an equivalent description of this Hilbert space. Instead of having the basis elements be half deltas as elements of the Hilbert space where the inner product is given by the ordinary Lebesgue measure dq, we redefine both the basis and the measure. We could consider, instead of a half delta with support , a Kronecker delta or characteristic function with support on q q, These functions have a similar behavior with respect to the product as the half deltas, namely q q , . The main difference is that neither nor their squares are integrable with respect to the Lebesgue mea sure having zero norm .

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0008v3 cond mat.mtrl sci 1 Jul 2008 Numerical solution of shock and ramp compression for general material properties Damian C. Swift Materials Science and Technology Division, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 7000, East Avenue, Livermore, CA 94550, U.S.A. Dated March 7, 2007 revised April 8, 2008 and July 1, 2008 LA UR 07 2051 Abstract A general formulation was developed to represent material models for applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high accuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for composite deformation paths, such as shock induced impacts, and shock interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics experiments, without requiring spatially resolving simulations. Example calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi isentropic and shock release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition. PACS numbers 62.50. p, 47.40. x, 62.20. x, 46.35. z Keywords material dynamics, shock, isentrope, adiabat, numerical solution, constitutive behavior Electronic address damian.swift physics.org 1 I. INTRODUCTION The continuum representation of matter is widely used for material dynamics in sci ence and engineering. Spatially resolved continuum dynamics simulations are the most widespread and familiar, solving the initial value problem by discretizing the spatial domain and integrating the dynamical equations forward in time to predict the motion and defor mation of components of the system. This type of simulation is used, for instance, to study hypervelocity impact problems such as the vulnerability of armor to projectiles , the performance of satellite debris shields , and the impact of meteorites with planets, notably the formation of the moon . The problem can be divided into the dynamical equations of the continuum, the state field of the components s r , and the inherent properties of the materials. Given the local material state s, the material properties allow the stress to be determined. Given the stress field r and mass density field r , the dynamical equations describe the fields of acceleration, compression, and thermodynamic work done on the materials. The equations of continuum dynamics describe the behavior of a dynamically deforming system of arbitrary complexity. Particular, simpler deformation paths can be described more compactly by different sets of equations, and solved by different techniques than those used for continuum dynamics in general. Simpler deformation paths occur often in experiments designed to develop and calibrate models of material properties. These paths can be regarded as different ways of interrogating the material properties. The principal examples in material dynamics are shock and ramp compression . Typical experiments are designed to induce such loading histories and measure or infer the properties of the material in these states before they are destroyed by release from the edges or by reflected waves. The development of the field of material dynamics was driven by applications in the physics of hypervelocity impact and high explosive systems, including nuclear weapons . In the regimes of interest, typically components with dimensions ranging from millime ters to meters and pressures from 1 GPa to 1 TPa, material behavior is dominated by the scalar equation of state EOS the relationship between pressure, compression or mass density , and internal energy. Other components of stress specifically shear stresses are much smaller, and chemical explosives react promptly so can be treated by simple mod els of complete detonation. EOS were developed as fits to experimental data, particularly 2 to series of shock states and to isothermal compression measurements . It is relatively straightforward to construct shock and ramp compression states from an EOS algebraically or numerically depending on the EOS, and to fit an EOS

Chunk: 4 . For low flow stress, the elastic wave travels at 13.2 km s. A plastic shock travels faster than this for pressures greater than 110 GPa, independent of the constitutive model. The speed of a plastic shock following the initial elastic wave is similar to the low strength case, because the material is already at its flow stress, but the speed of a single plastic shock is appreciably higher. For compression to a given normal stress, the temperature is significantly higher with plastic flow included. The additional heating is particularly striking on the principal adi abat the temperature departs significantly from the principal isentrope. Thus ramp wave compression of strong materials may lead to significant levels of heating, contrary to com mon assumptions of small temperature increases . Plastic flow is largely irreversible, so heating occurs on unloading as well as loading. Thus, on adiabatic release from a shock compressed state, additional heating occurs compared with the no strength case. These levels of heating are important as shock or release melting may occur at a significantly lower shock pressure than would be expected ignoring the effect of strength. Fig. 5. C. Phase changes An important property of condensed matter is phase changes, including solid solid poly morphism and solid liquid. An equilibrium phase diagram can be represented as a single overall EOS surface as before. Multiple, competing phases with kinetics for each phase trans formation can be represented conveniently using the structure described above for general material properties, for example by describing the local state as a set of volume fractions fi of each possible simple EOS phase, with transition rates and equilibration among them. 17 This model is described in more detail elsewhere . However, it is interesting to investi gate the robustness of the numerical scheme for calculating shock Hugoniots when the EOS has the discontinuities in value and gradient associated with phase changes. The EOS of molten metal, and the solid liquid phase transition, can be represented to a reasonable approximation as an adjustment to the EOS of the solid ptwo phase , e psolid , e where e T , e Tm e hm hm cv , e T , e Tm hm e hm otherwise and hm is the specific latent heat of fusion. Taking the EOS and a modified Lindemann melting curve for Al , and using .397 MJ kg, the shock Hugoniot algorithm was found to operate stably across the phase transition Fig. 6 . V. COMPOSITE LOADING PATHS Given methods to calculate shock and adiabatic loading paths from arbitrary initial states, a considerable variety of experimental scenarios can be treated from the interaction of loading or unloading waves with interfaces between different materials, in planar geometry for uniaxial compression. The key physical constraint is that, if two dissimilar materials are to remain in contact after an interaction such as an impact or the passage of a shock, the normal stress n and particle speed up in both materials must be equal on either side of the interface. The change in particle speed and stress normal to the waves were calculated above for compression waves running in the direction of increasing spatial ordinate left to right . Across an interface, the sense is reversed for the material at the left. Thus a projectile impacting a stationary target to the right is decelerated from its initial speed by the shock induced by impact. The general problem at an interface can be analyzed by considering the states at the instant of first contact on impact, or when a shock traveling through a sandwich of ma terials first reaches the interface. The initial states are . The final states are uj, s l uj, r r where uj is the joint particle speed, n s l n s r , and s i is connected to si 18 by either a shock or an adiabat,

Chunk: to these measurements. More recently, applications and scientific interest have grown to include a wider range of pressures and time scales, such as laser driven inertial confinement fusion , and experiments are designed to measure other aspects than the EOS, such as the kinetics of phase changes, con stitutive behavior describing shear stresses, incomplete chemical reactions, and the effects of microstructure, including grain orientation and porosity. Theoretical techniques have also evolved to predict the EOS with 1 accuracy and elastic contributions to shear stress with slightly poorer accuracy . A general convention for representing material states is described, and numerical methods are reported for calculating shock and ramp compression states from general representations of material properties. II. CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURE FOR MATERIAL PROPERTIES The desired structure for the description of the material state and properties under dy namic loading was developed to be as general as possible with respect to the types of material or models to be represented in the same framework, and designed to give the greatest amount of commonality between spatially resolved simulations and calculations of shock and ramp compressions. In condensed matter on sub microsecond time scales, heat conduction is often too slow to have a significant effect on the response of the material, and is ignored here. The equations of non relativistic continuum dynamics are, in Lagrangian form, i.e. along characteristics moving with the local material velocity u r , D r, t r, t div u r, t D u r, t r, t div r, t De r, t r, t grad u r, t where is the mass density and e the specific internal energy. Changes in e can be related to changes in the temperature T through the heat capacity. The inherent properties of 3 each material in the problem are described by its constitutive relation or equation of state s . As well as experiencing compression and work from mechanical deformation, the local material state s r, t can evolve through internal processes such as plastic flow. In general, Ds r, t Dt s s r, t , U r, t U grad u r, t which can also include the equations for t and e t. Thus the material properties must describe at a minimum s and s s r, t , U r, t for each material. If they also describe T s , the conductivity, and s e , then heat conduction can be treated. Other functions may be needed for particular numerical methods in continuum dynamics, such as the need for wave speeds e.g. the longitudinal sound speed , which are needed for time step control in explicit time integration. Internally, within the material properties models, it is desirable to re use software as much as possible, and other functions of the state are therefore desirable to allow models to be constructed in a modular and hierarchical way. Arithmetic manipulations must be performed on the state during numerical integration, and these can be encoded neatly using operator overloading, so the operator of the appropriate type is invoked automatically without having to include if then else structures for each operator as is the case in non object oriented programming languages such as Fortran 77. For instance, if s is calculated in a forward time numerical method then changes of state are calculated using numerical evolution equations such as s t t s t t s. Thus for a general state s and its time derivative s, which has an equivalent set of compo nents, it is necessary to multiply a state by a real number and to add two states together. For a specific software implementation, other operations may be needed, for example to create, copy, or destroy a new instance of a state. The attraction of this approach is that, by choosing a reasonably general form for the constitutive relation and associated operations, it is possible to

Chunk: separate the continuum dynamics part of the problem from the inherent behavior of the material. The relations describing the properties of different types of material can be encapsulated in a library form where the continuum dynamics program need know nothing about the relations for any spe cific type of material, and vice versa. The continuum dynamics programs and the material properties relations can be developed and maintained independently of each other, provided that the interface remains the same Table I . This is an efficient way to make complicated 4 material models available for simulations of different types, including Lagrangian and Eule rian hydrocodes operating on different numbers of dimensions, and calculations of specific loading or heating histories such as shock and ramp loading discussed below. Software in terfaces have been developed in the past for scalar EOS with a single structure for the state , but object oriented techniques make it practical to extend the concept to much more complicated states, to combinations of models, and to alternative types of model selected when the program is run, without having to find a single super set state encompassing all possible states as special cases. A very wide range of types of material behavior can be represented with this formalism. At the highest level, different types of behavior are characterized by different structures for the state s Table II . For each type of state, different specific models can be defined, such as perfect gas, polytropic and Gr uneisen EOS. For each specific model, different materials are represented by choosing different values for the parameters in the model, and different local material states are represented through different values for the components of s. In the jargon of object oriented programming, the ability to define an object whose precise type is undetermined until the program is run is known as polymorphism. For our application, polymorphism is used at several levels in the hierarchy of objects, from the overall type of a material such as one represented by a pressure density energy EOS or one represented by a deviatoric stress model through the type of relation used to describe the properties of that material type such as perfect gas, polytropic, or Gr uneisen for a pressure density energy EOS, or Steinberg Guinan or Preston Tonks Wallace for a deviatoric stress model , to the type of general mathematical function used to represent some of these relations such as a polynomial or a tabular representation of in a polytropic EOS Table III . States or models may be defined by extending or combining other states or models this can be implemented using the object oriented programming concept of inheritance. Thus deviatoric stress models can be defined as an extension to any pressure density energy EOS they are usually written assuming a specific type, such as Steinberg s cubic Gr uneisen form , homo geneous mixtures can be defined as combinations of any pressure density temperature EOS, and heterogeneous mixtures can be defined as combinations of materials each represented by any type of material model. Trial implementations have been made as libraries in the C and Java programming languages . The external interface to the material properties was general at the level 5 of representing a generic material type and state. The type of state and model were then selected when programs using the material properties library were run. In C , objects which were polymorphic at run time had to be represented as pointers, requiring additional software constructions to allocate and free up physical memory associated with each object. It was possible to include general re usable functions as polymorphic objects when defining models real functions of one real parameter could be polynomials, transcendentals, tabular with different interpolation schemes, piecewise definitions over different regions of the one dimensional line, sums, products, etc again defined specifically at run time. Object oriented polymorphism and inheritance were

If plastic work is also included during this adiabatic compression, the overall heating for a given compression is greater than from the RH equations. To be consistent, plastic flow should be neglected while the artificial viscosity is non zero. This localized disabling of physical processes, particularly time dependent ones, during the passage of the unphysically smeared shock was previously found necessary for numerically stable simulations of detonation waves by reactive flow . Detonation waves are reactive shock waves. Steady planar detonation the Chapman Jouguet state may be calculated using the RH relations, by imposing the condition that the material state behind the shock is fully reacted. Several numerical methods have been used to solve the RH equations for materials repre sented by an EOS only . The general RH equations may be solved numerically for a given shock compression by varying the specific internal energy e until the normal stress from the material model equals that from the RH energy equation, Eq. 17. The shock and particle speeds are then calculated from Eqs 15 and 16. This numerical method is particu larly convenient for EOS of the form p , e , as e may be varied directly. Solutions may still be found for general material models using s e , by which the energy may be varied until the solution is found. Numerically, the solution was found by bracketing and bisection 1. For given compression , take the low energy end for bracketing as a nearby state s e.g. the previous state, of lower compression, on the Hugoniot , compressed adia batically to state s , and cooled so the specific internal energy is e s . 2. Bracket the desired state apply successively larger heating increments e to s, evolv 10 ing each trial state internally, until n s from the material model exceeds n e e0 from Eq. 17. 3. Bisect in e, evolving each trial state internally, until n s equals n e e0 to the desired accuracy. As with ramp compression, the independent variable for solution was mass density , and finite steps were taken. Each shock state was calculated independently of the rest, so numerical errors did not accumulate along the shock Hugoniot. The accuracy of the solution was independent of . A tabular Hugoniot can be calculated by solving over a range of , but again when simulating experimental scenarios it is usually more useful to calculate the shock state where one of the other thermodynamic quantities reaches a certain value, often that up and n match the values from another, simultaneous shock calculation for another material the situation in impact and shock transmission problems, discussed below. Specific stop conditions were found by monitoring the quantity of interest until bracketed by a finite solution step, then bisecting until the stop condition was satisfied to a chosen accuracy. During bisection, each trial calculation was performed as a shock from the initial conditions to the trial shock compression. C. Accuracy application to air The accuracy of these numerical schemes was tested by comparing with shock and ramp compression of a material represented by a perfect gas EOS, 1 e. The numerical solution requires a value to be chosen for every parameter in the material model, here . Air was chosen as an example material, with 1.4. Air at standard tem perature and pressure has approximately 10 3 g cm3 and .25 MJ kg. Isentropes for the perfect gas EOS have the form p constant, and shock Hugoniots have the form 1 2e0 0 p0 0 1 0 1 . 11 The numerical solutions reproduced the principal isentrope and Hugoniot to 10 3 and 0.1 respectively, for

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0009v1 astro ph 2 Apr 2007 The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Insterstellar Clouds. IX. The Serpens YSO Population As Observed With IRAC and MIPS Paul Harvey1, Bruno Mer n2, Tracy L. Huard3, Luisa M. Rebull4, Nicholas Chapman5, Neal J. Evans II1, Philip C. Myers3 ABSTRACT We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy observations of the Serpens star forming region. In particular we present a set of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO s, from the extensive background contamination by extra galactic objects. We then discuss the prop erties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO s. We find 235 such objects in the 0.85 deg2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO s outside this area is identified from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. To understand the properties of the circumstellar material that produces the observed infrared emission, we describe two sets of results, the use of color color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with those of theoretical models for star disk envelope systems and our own modeling of the subset of our objects that appear to be well represented by a stellar photosphere plus circumstellar disk. These objects exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO s in Serpens extends down to at least a few 10 3 L or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc. The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO s from extra galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO s at very low luminosities. We find no evidence for 1Astronomy Department, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station C1400, Austin, TX 78712 0259 pmh astro.as.utexas.edu, nje astro.as.utexas.edu 2Research and Scientific Support Dept., ESTEC ESA , Keplerlaan, 1, PO Box 299, 2200 AG Noord wijk, The Netherlands and Leiden Observatory, Leiden University, Postbus 9513, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands bmerin rssd.esa.int 3Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, 60 Garden Street, MS42, Cambridge, MA 02138 thuard cfa.harvard.edu, pmyers cfa.harvard.edu 4Spitzer Science Center, MC 220 6, Pasadena, CA 91125 rebull ipac.caltech.edu 5Astronomy Department, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742 chapman astro.umd.edu 2 variability in the shorter IRAC bands between the two epochs of our data set, t 6 hours. A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less evolved YSO s are more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background extra galactic population can be fit by the same two point correlation function as seen in other extra galactic studies. We also present a table of matches between several previous infrared and X ray studies of the Serpens YSO population and our Spitzer data set. The clusters in Serpens have a very high surface density of YSOs, primarily with SEDs suggesting extreme youth. The total number of YSOs, mostly Class II, is greater in the region outside the clusters. Subject headings infrared general clouds star forming regions 1.

Chunk: diagrams Numerous authors have shown how combinations of colors in the infrared can provide significant diagnostic information on the configuration and total amount of circumstellar material around young stars. Whitney et al. modelled a wide range of disk and envelope configurations and computed their appearance in a number of infrared color color and color magnitude diagrams particularly relevant to Spitzer s wavelength range. Similarly Allen et al. have published IRAC color color diagrams for another set of models of objects with circumstellar disks and or envelopes. Recently, Robitaille et al. have computed a very large grid of models to extend the predictions from those of Whitney et al. to a much larger parameter space. Observationally, Lada et al. have used IRAC and MIPS colors from Spitzer observations to classify the optical thickness of disks around pre main sequence stars in IC 348, using the terms anemic disks and thick disks 25 Fig. 10. Left panel the two point correlation function, W, for Serpens. The dotted histogram is for sources identified as Class I and Flat SED objects, i.e. 0.3. The solid histogram is for the Class II III objects, i.e. 0.3. The dashed lines show several possible power law slopes for the portions of the YSO curves. Right panel the dashed histogram is for the objects classified as likely background galaxies with S . The dash dot line shows the slope and amplitude found by Maddox et al. for the bright end of the extra galactic population, which is a quite good fit to our estimate of the background contamination in our sample. 26 to point to objects roughly in the Class III and Class II portions of the ubiquitous Class System Lada 1987 Greene et al. 1994 . Figure 11 shows three color color diagrams and one color magnitude diagram for the 235 Serpens YSO s compared to the density of models from Robitaille et al. for a model cluster at the distance of Serpens with brightnesses limited to those appropriate for our sensitivity levels. For two of the diagrams the figure also indicates the approximate areas where most of the models fall for the three physical stages, I, II, and III, described by Robitaille et al. that roughly correspond to the observational classes I Flat, II, and III. These diagrams display, first of all, that YSO s come in a wide range of colors and brightnesses large areas of all the diagrams are occupied. In a general way we find objects located in these diagrams where the models of Whitney et al. , Allen et al. , and Robitaille et al. would predict for pre main sequence stars with a range of evolutionary states as well as general agreement with the locations of young objects found in IC348 by Lada et al. . For example, consistent with our finding in paper I that the bulk of the YSO s are class II objects, we see a strong concentration in the area around 5.8 8.0 0.8, 3.6 4.5 0.5 where both Allen et al. and Whitney et al. predict such sources should be located. Additionally, there is structure in the 8.0 vs. 3.6 8.0 color magnitude diagram for the distribution of Serpens YSO s that is also evident in the density of models of Robitaille et al. . There are, however, some interesting differences. The Stage II area from Robitaille et al. includes a smaller fraction of our nominal Class II objects than might be expected. There is also a larger number of very red objects in several of the diagrams than is predicted by the density of models in those areas, considering that the faintest grey levels correspond to a probability equal to 10 4 of the maximum probability. Some of this may be due to effects of reddening, but it suggests that the models may also need some refinement, despite their rough agreement with the distribution of

Spectral Energy Distributions of the Class III sources in the sample. 39 Fig. 20. Spectral Energy Distributions of the Class III sources in the sample. 40 9. Selected Sources 9.1. The Coldest Objects Table 9 lists the 15 YSO s that display the coldest energy distributions. These are the objects whose ratio of F70 . Six of these are in Cluster A the core and four in Cluster B. Two are in a small grouping about 0.2 northeast of Cluster B, and the remaining three appear as isolated cold objects, though in areas with other moderately red objects. All of these except for two of the isolated cold objects, ID s 105 and 148, are associated with dense clumps of millimeter emission as seen by Enoch et al. . As discussed in the following section, two in Cluster A and one in Cluster B are associated with high velocity outflows. As has been noted already by Padgett et al. and Rebull et al. , it is striking how many of these coldest, most obscured YSO s are located in compact clusters together with objects that are substantially more evolved in the nominal system of classes, e.g. Class II and III. 9.2. Outflow Sources A number of recent Spitzer studies have found that high velocity shocked outflows from young stars are visible in IRAC images, typically strongest at 4.5 m Noreiga Crespo et al. 2004 . We have examined our images for such outflows as well as for correspondance with the lists of published HH objects in the region Ziener Eisloffel 1999 . Table 10 summarizes the results of this effort. Two strong, obvious jet like features are seen in Cluster A and one in Cluster B. In addition, as shown in Table 10, we find small extended features at the positions of most of the known HH objects in Serpens that were within our covered area. The two jets in Cluster A appear to originate from two of the most deeply embedded objects in this cluster that are associated with the sub mm sources SMM1 and SMM5 Testi Sargent 1998 . Both these outflows are aligned roughly in the NW SE direction and are visible on both sides of the central 24 m likely exciting sources. In Cluster B there is one obvious jet like feature extending mostly south of YSO 75. There is also probably faint emission visible 30 to the north of the embedded source as well. Harvey et al. discuss the Cluster B jet and several nearby Spitzer sources in more detail. Figures 23 and 24 show 3 color images of Clusters A and B with the color tables chosen to make these jets most visible. In addition to the optical HH objects in the Serpens Clouds, there are a number of high velocity molecular outflows that have been mapped in Cluster A Davis et al. 1999 . These maps present a confusing picture of outflows, and because of the relatively larger beamwidth of the mm observations and close packing of infrared sources in this cluster, it is 41 Fig. 21. Distribution of disk to star luminosity ratios. The solid and dashed lines are the total sample and T Tauri like sample of SEDs, respectively. Also marked are the typical ranges of Ldisk Lstar ratios for debris disks, passive irradiated disks and accretion disks.

Chunk: in Serpens. The process of simulating these effects is discussed in detail in the final c2d data delivery documentation Evans et al. 2007 , but the steps are summarized here. To avoid effects that may result from differences in data processing, the BCD images for this SWIRE field were processed by our pipeline in exactly the same way as our own obser vations. Once a bandmerged catalog of SWIRE sources was constructed, we first simulated the reddening of sources that would occur if Serpens had been in the foreground of this field. This reddening was accomplished by randomly applying extinction to each SWIRE source according to the extinction profile of Serpens, shown in Figure 2. For example, 23 of SWIRE sources were randomly selected and visual extinctions in the range 6.5 .5 were applied, 19 of sources were extincted by extinctions in the range 7.5 .5, and so forth. The extinctions were applied to each of the infrared bands according to the extinction law appropriate for molecular clouds and cores Huard et al., in prep. . Second, we degraded the sensitivity of the reddened SWIRE photometry to match that of our Serpens observations. This was accomplished by matching the detection rates as a function of magnitude in each of the bands. The 90 completeness limits of the Serpens observations are approximately 16.6, 15.6, 15.0, 16.6, 16.2, 15.2, 13.4, and 9.6 mag at J, H, K, 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , and , respectively. Thus, for each band, all reddened SWIRE sources brighter than the completeness limit in Serpens would be detectable by c2d like observations and are identified as such in the resampled SWIRE catalog. Most, but not all, sources fainter than the completeness limit will not be detected by c2d like observations. We randomly select which sources to identify as detections, in a given band, in such as way as to reproduce the empirically determined shape of the completeness function. This resampling process is performed for each band, resulting in those sources fainter than the completeness limits in some bands being detected or not detected with the same probabilities as those for similar sources in Serpens. The photometric uncertainties of all sources in the resampled catalog of reddened SWIRE sources are re assigned uncertainties similar to those of Serpens 8 sources with similar magnitudes. Finally, each source in the resampled SWIRE catalog is re classified, based on its de graded photometry, e.g. star , YSOc , GALc , .... The magnitudes, colors, and classi fications of sources in this resampled SWIRE catalog are then directly comparable to those in our Serpens catalog and may be used to estimate the population of extragalactic sources satisfying various color and magnitude criteria. At this level of the classification, the terms YSOc and GALc imply candidate classification status. 3.2. Classification Based on Color and Magnitude In Paper I we described a simple set of criteria that basically categorized all objects that were faint and red in several combinations of IRAC and MIPS colors as likely to be galaxies after removal of normal reddened stars . In our new classification we have extended this concept to include the color and magnitude spaces in Figure 3 together with several additional criteria to compute a proxy for the probability that a source is a YSO or a background galaxy. Figure 3 shows a collection of three color magnitude diagrams and one color color diagram used to classify the sources found in our 3.6 to 70 m survey of the Serpens Cloud that had S N 3 in all the Spitzer bands between 3 and 24 m and that were not classified as reddened stellar photospheres. In addition to the Serpens sources shown in the left panels, the comparable set of sources from the full sensitivity SWIRE catalog are shown in the center panels, and the sources remaining in the extincted sensitivity resampled version

Queries:
1. How is the reddening effect simulated on SWIRE sources based on the extinction profile of Serpens?
2. How is the sensitivity of the reddened SWIRE photometry degraded to match that of Serpens observations?
3. What is the process of reclassifying sources in the resampled SWIRE catalog, and how does it make magnitudes, colors, and classifications comparable to those in the Serpens catalog?

Note: There seems to be a minor error in your list of queries (Query 2). It should be asking "How is the sensitivity of the reddened SWIRE photometry degraded to match that of Serpens observations?" not "How is the sensitivity of the reddened SWIRE photometry determined to match that of Serpens observations?". This change would focus more accurately on the specific process of matching the sensitivity to Serpens observations. Please consider revising your queries to better match the academic chunk provided.

Chunk: of the SWIRE catalog described above are shown in the right panels. The exact details of our classification scheme are described in Appendix A. Basically we form the product of individual probabilities from each of the three color magnitude diagrams in Figure 3 and then use additional factors to modify that total probability based on source properties such as its K 4.5 color, whether it was found to be extended in either of the shorter IRAC bands, and whether its flux density is above or below some empirically determined limits in several critical bands. Table 1 summarizes the criteria used for this class separation. The cutoffs in each of the color magnitude diagrams and the final probability threshold to separate YSO s from extragalactic objects were chosen to provide a nearly complete elimination of all SWIRE objects from the YSO class, and to maximize the number of YSO s selected in Serpens consistent with visual inspection of the images to eliminate obvious extragalactic objects such as a previously uncatalogued obvious spiral galaxy at .4s , 31 41 J2000 . The cutoffs in color magnitude space were constructed as smooth, exponentially de caying probabilities around the dashed lines in each of the three diagrams. Sources far 9 Fig. 2. The distribution of visual extinctions found toward the roughly 50,000 sources classified as stars in our Serpens observations. 10 below the lines were assigned a high probability of being extra galactic contamination with a smoothly decreasing probability to low levels well above the lines. In the case of the versus 8.0 relation, the probability dropped offradially away from the center of the elliptical segment shown in the figure. After inclusion of these three color magnitude criteria, we added the additional criteria listed in Table 1. These included a factor dependent on the K 4.5 color, Prob K 4.5 , to reflect the higher probability of a source being an extra galactic GALc contaminant if it is bluer in that color, a higher GALc probability for sources that are extended at either 3.6 or 4.8 m where our survey had the best sensitivity and highest spatial resolution, a decrease in GALc probability for sources with a 70 m flux density above 400 mJy, empirically determined from examination of the SWIRE data, and identification as extragalactic for any source fainter .0. Again, we emphasize that these criteria are based only on the empirical approach of trying to charac terize the SWIRE population in color magnitude space as precisely as possible, not on any kind of modeling of the energy distributions. Figure 4 graphically shows the division between YSO s and likely extragalactic contam inants. The number counts versus our probability are shown for both the Serpens cloud and for the resampled SWIRE catalog normalized to the Serpens area . This illustrates how cleanly the objects in the SWIRE catalog are identified by this probability criterion. In the Serpens sample there are clearly two well separated groups of objects plus a tail of intermediate probability objects that we have mostly classified as YSO s since no such tail is apparent in the SWIRE sample. Our choice of the exact cut between YSO and XGal in Figure 4 is somewhat ar bitrary because of the low level tail of objects in Serpens in the area of log probability 1.5. Since the area of sky included in our SWIRE sample is more than six times as large as the mapped area of Serpens, we chose our final probability cut, log P 1.47, to allow two objects from the full not resampled SWIRE catalog into the YSO classifica tion bin. Thus, aside from the vagaries of small number statistics, we expect of order 0 1 extragalactic interlopers in our list of Serpens YSO s. The right panels in Figure 3, which use the resampled version of the SWIRE catalog, show that the effects of sensitivity and, especially, the

Chunk: and MIPS24 there are 197 objects that satisfy the criteria of Harvey et al. , i.e., , , 10 and 24 m S N 5. Of these, 184 satisfy our more restrictive criteria in this study based on the combination of 2MASS, IRAC, and MIPS data, or 93 . We would classify the other 13 as likely background galaxies. Secondly, of the 235 YSO s found in this study, 200 have sufficient data to be classifiable by the mips only criteria above, but only 167 or 84 actually meet the mips only YSO criteria. In other words, 33 objects have been classified as high quality YSO s in this paper in the MIPS IRAC overlap region that did not meet the criteria based only on MIPS and 2MASS data. If these ratios can be extrapolated to 16 the larger area covered only by MIPS, then we would expect Harvey et al. to have missed 16 8 or 9 of the YSO s but to have included 7 3 or 4 that would not meet our combined IRAC MIPS criteria. With these corrections we might have expected to find 235 s in the entire 1.8 deg2 area covered by MIPS if we had matching IRAC observations. Finally, in light of our earlier discussion of AGB contaminants, it is possible that 6 9 of these YSO s would actually be found to be background AGB stars. 4. Search for Variability The fact that our data were taken in two epochs separated by 6 hours or more gives us the opportunity to search for variability over that time scale. Rebull et al. and Harvey et al. have performed similar tests for variability of the 24 m emission from sources in the c2d observations of Perseus and Serpens and found no reliable evidence for variability at that wavelength. There is, however, substantial evidence for short term vari ability in the near infrared for YSO s. We, therefore, performed a similar investigation in the two shortest IRAC bands, 3.6 and 4.5 m. No clear evidence was found at the level of 25 for any sources in the field over the 6 hour time scale of our multi epoch observations. 5. Comparison with Previous Studies of Serpens We have cross correlated our source catalog with those from previous studies of Serpens that searched for YSO s. We chose three studies that covered much of Cluster A at both near IR, ISO, and X ray wavelengths Eiroa Casali 1992 Kaas et al. 2004 Preibisch 2003 , and one recent ISO study of Cluster B Djupvik et al. 2006 . Table 4 lists the sources from each of these previous studies and the best matching Spitzer source from our complete catalog. In brief, we find good matches for essentially all the previous IR selected YSO s that had S . In detail, however, a number of YSO candidates from the earlier studies were not classified as YSO s in our study. The reasons for this are different for the various catalogs. From the X ray catalog of Preibisch Preibisch 2003 in Cluster A, we only identified 17 of the 45 X ray sources as YSO s on the basis of their infrared excesses. The X ray sources that were not identified as YSO s included both many objects that were well fitted as reddened stellar photospheres 21 sources and objects with some likely infrared excess but too little to fit our criteria aimed at eliminating extra galactic interlopers. The situation with the infrared catalogs is somewhat different. Examining our non matches from the ground based study of Eiroa Casali , we find that a large fraction of their YSO s are classified as such by 17 our criteria, but not all. From the ISO surveys Kaas et al. 2004 Djupvik et al. 2006 we typically identify 50 60 as YSO s. The ones that we do not classify

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0010v1 math.CO 31 Mar 2007 Partial cubes structures, characterizations, and constructions Sergei Ovchinnikov Mathematics Department San Francisco State University San Francisco, CA 94132 sergei sfsu.edu May 8, 2006 Abstract Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph defined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi c s and Winkler s rela tions play an important role in the theory of partial cubes. These struc tures are employed in the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and par tial cubes of arbitrary dimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known results are given. The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and contraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes from old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finite partial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated. Key words Hypercube, partial cube, semicube 1 Introduction A hypercube H X on a set X is a graph which vertices are the finite subsets of X two vertices are joined by an edge if they differ by a singleton. A partial cube is a graph that can be isometrically embedded into a hypercube. There are three general graph theoretical structures that play a prominent role in the theory of partial cubes namely, semicubes, Djokovi c s relation , and Winkler s relation . We use these structures, in particular, to characterize bi partite graphs and partial cubes. The characterization problem for partial cubes was considered as an important one and many characterizations are known. We list contributions in the chronological order Djokovi c , Avis , Winkler , Roth and Winkler , Chepoi 1988 and 1994 . In the paper, we present new proofs for the results of Djokovi c , Winkler , and Chepoi , and obtain two more characterizations of partial cubes. 1 The paper is also concerned with some ways of constructing new partial cubes from old ones. Properties of subcubes, the Cartesian product of partial cubes, and expansion and contraction of a partial cube are investigated. We introduce a construction based on pasting two graphs together and show how new partial cubes can be obtained from old ones by pasting them together. The paper is organized as follows. Hypercubes and partial cubes are introduced in Section 2 together with two basic examples of infinite partial cubes. Vertex sets of partial cubes are described in terms of well graded families of finite sets. In Section 3 we introduce the concepts of a semicube, Djokovi c s and Win kler s relations, and establish some of their properties. Bipartite graphs and partial cubes are characterized by means of these structures. One more charac terization of partial cubes is obtained in Section 4, where so called fundamental sets in a graph are introduced. The rest of the paper is devoted to constructions subcubes and the Carte sian product Section 6 , pasting Section 7 , and expansions and contractions Section 8 . We show that these constructions produce new partial cubes from old ones. Isometric and lattice dimensions of new partial cubes are calculated. These dimensions are introduced in Section 5. Few words about conventions used in the paper are in order. The sum disjoint union A B of two sets A and B is the union A B . All graphs in the paper are simple undirected graphs. In the notation V, E , the symbol V stands for the set of vertices of the graph G and E stands for its set of edges. By abuse of language, we often write ab for an edge in a graph if this is the case, ab is an unordered pair of distinct vertices. We denote the graph induced by the set of vertices U V . If G is a connected graph, then dG a, b stands for the distance between two vertices a and b of

For the second query, prove that pasting of two partial cubes G1 and G2 along two isomorphic subgraphs H1 and H2 does not produce a partial cube.

For the third query, describe the process of vertex pasting and edge pasting to produce partial cubes from partial cubes.

Chunk: vertex pasting of its blocks using its block cut vertex tree structure. Let G1 be an endblock of G with a cut vertex v and G2 be the union of the remaining blocks of G. Then G can be obtained from G1 and G2 by vertex pasting along the vertex v. It follows that any connected graph can be obtained from its blocks by successive vertex pastings. Let V, E be a partial cube. We recall that the isometric dimension dimI G of G is the cardinality of the quotient set E , where is Djokovi c s equivalence relation on the set E cf. formula . Theorem 7.2. Let V, E be a partial cube obtained by vertex pasting together partial cubes V1, E1 and V2, E2 . Then dimI G dimI G1 dimI G2 . Proof. It suffices to prove that there are no edges xy E1 and uv E2 which are in Djokovi c s relation with each other. Suppose that G1 and G2 are vertex pasted along vertices a1 E1 and a2 E2 and let . Let xy E1 and uv E2 be two edges in E. We may assume that u Wxy. Since a is a cut vertex of G and u Wxy, we have d u, a d a, x d u, x d u, y d u, a d a, y . Hence, d a, x d a, y , which implies d v, x d v, a d a, x d v, a d a, y d v, y . It follows that v Wxy. Therefore the edge xy does not stand in the relation to the vertex uv. The next result follows immediately from the previous theorem. Note that blocks of a partial cube are partial cubes themselves. Corollary 7.1. Let G be a partial cube and be the family of its blocks. Then dimI G n X Gi . In the case of the lattice dimension of a partial cube we can claim only much weaker result than one stated in Theorem 7.2 for the isometric dimension. We omit the proof. 21 Theorem 7.3. Let G be a partial cube obtained by vertex pasting together partial cubes G1 and G2. Then max dimZ G dimZ G1 dimZ G2 . The following example illustrate possible cases for inequalities in Theo rem 7.3. Let us recall that the lattice dimension of a tree with m leaves is m 2 cf. . Example 7.4. The star K1,6 can be obtained from the stars K1,2 and K1,4 by vertex pasting these two stars along their centers. Clearly, K1,6 dimZ K1,2 dimZ K1,4 . The same star K1,6 is obtained from two copies of the star K1,3 by vertex pasting along their centers. We have dimZ K1,3 2, dimZ K1,6 3, so K1,6 dimZ K1,3 dimZ K1,3 . Let us vertex paste two stars K1,3 along their two leaves. The resulting graph T is a tree with four vertices. Therefore, T dimZ K1,3 dimZ K1,3 . We now consider another simple way of pasting two graphs together. Let V1, E1 and V2, E2 be two connected graphs, a1b1 E1, a2b2 E2, and , , , . Let G be the graph obtained by pasting G1 and G2 along subgraphs H1 and H2. In this case we say that the graph G is obtained from graphs G1 and G2 by edge pasting. Figures 7.1, 7.2, and 7.5 illustrate this construction. Figure 7.5 An example of edge pasting. As before, we identify the graphs G1 and G2 with subgraphs of the graph G and denote , , respectively, b1 and b2. The edge ab E is obtained by pasting together edges a1b1 E1 and a2b2 E2 cf. Figure 7.5 . Then , V1 . We use these notations in the rest of this section. Proposition 7.1. A graph G obtained by edge pasting together bipartite graphs G1

Chunk: and v2 V 2, dG u1, v2 dG u, v 1. Let Pu1v2 be a shortest path in G . There is a unique edge x1x2 M such that x1, x2 Pu1v2 and the sections Pu1x1 and Px2v2 of the path Pu1v2 are shortest paths in V 1 and V 2 , respectively. The projection Puv of Pu1v2 in G is a shortest path in G. Proof. i Let Pu1v1 be a path in G that intersects V 2. Since is an isometric subgraph of G, there is a path Puv in G that belongs to . Then p 1 1 Puv is a path in V 1 of the same length as Puv. By and , l p 1 1 Puv l Pu1v1 . Therefore any shortest path Pu1v1 in G belongs to V 1 . The result follows. ii Let Pu1v2 be a shortest path in G and Puv be its projection to V . By , dG u1, v2 l Pu1v2 l Puv dG u, v . Since there is no edge of G joining vertices in V1 V2 and V2 V1, a shortest path in G from u to v must contain a vertex x V1 V2. Since G1 and G2 are isometric subgraphs, there are shortest paths Pux in G1 and Pxv in G2 such that their union is a shortest path from u to v. Then, by the triangle inequality and part i of the proof, we have cf. Figure 8.1 dG u1, v2 dG u1, x1 dG x1, x2 dG x2, v2 dG u, v 1. The last two displayed formulas imply dG u1, v2 dG u, v 1. Since u1 V 1 and v2 V 2 the path Pu1v2 must contain an edge, say x1x2, in M. Since this path is a shortest path in G , this edge is unique. Then the sec tions Pu1x1 and Px2v2 of Pu1v2 are shortest paths in V 1 and V 2 , respectively. Clearly, Puv is a shortest path in G. 28 Let a1a2 be an edge in the matching . This edge defines five fundamental sets cf. Section 4 the semicubes Wa1a2 and Wa2a1, the sets of vertices Ua1a2 and Ua2a1, and the set of edges Fa1a2. The next theorem follows immediately from Lemma 8.1. It gives a hint to a connection between the expansion process and partial cubes. Theorem 8.1. Let G be an expansion of a connected graph G and notations are chosen as above. Then i 1 and 2 are convex semicubes of G . ii , which are isomorphic to the subgraph G1 G2. The result of Theorem 8.1 justifies the following constructive definition of the contraction process. Definition 8.2. Let ab be an edge of a connected graph G V , E such that i semicubes Wab and Wba are convex and form a partition of V ii the set Fab is a matching and defines an isomorphism between subgraphs and . A graph G obtained from the graphs and by pasting them along subgraphs and is said to be a contraction of the graph G . Remark 8.1. If G is bipartite, then semicubes Wab and Wba form a partition of its vertex set. Then, by Theorem 4.1, condition i implies condition ii . Thus any pair of opposite convex semicubes in a connected bipartite graph defines a contraction of this graph. By Theorem 8.1, a graph is a contraction of its expansion. It is not difficult to see that any connected graph is also an expansion of its contraction. The following three examples give geometric illustrations for the expansion and contraction procedures. Example 8.1. Let a and b be two opposite vertices in the graph . Clearly, the two distinct paths P1 and P2 from a to b are isometric subgraphs of G defining an expansion G C6 of G see Figure 8.2 . Note that

2. What is the function of the unique edge x1x2 in the given shortest path proof?
3. Describe the relationship between expansion, semi-cubes, and contraction processes in a connected graph.

## Answer 1
There isn't a direct answer to the question in the given chunk. However, based on the general concepts of graph theory, the triangle inequality equation (dG u1, v2 ≤ dG u1, x1 + dG x1, x2 + dG x2, v2) can be derived from the shortest path equation by considering the shortest path from u to v composed of three segments: from u to x1, from x1 to x2, and from x2 to v. The sum of the lengths of these three segments can be no greater than the length of the shortest path between u and v, which is why the triangle inequality holds.

## Answer 2
In the given shortest path proof, the unique edge x1x2 is used to show that a shortest path from u to v in G

Chunk: the graph G. Wherever it is clear from the context which graph is under consideration, we drop the subscript G in dG a, b . A subgraph H G is an isometric subgraph if dH a, b dG a, b for all vertices a and b of H it is convex if any shortest path in G between vertices of H belongs to H. 2 Hypercubes and partial cubes Let X be a set. We denote Pf X the set of all finite subsets of X. Definition 2.1. A graph H X has the set Pf X as the set of its vertices a pair of vertices PQ is an edge of H X if the symmetric difference P Q is a singleton. The graph H X is called the hypercube on X . If X is a finite set of cardinality n, then the graph H X is the n cube Qn. The dimension of the hypercube H X is the cardinality of the set X. 2 The shortest path distance d P, Q on the hypercube H X is the Hamming distance between sets P and Q d P, Q P Q for P, Q Pf. The set Pf X is a metric space with the metric d. Definition 2.2. A graph G is a partial cube if it can be isometrically embedded into a hypercube H X for some set X. We often identify G with its isometric image in the hypercube H X , and say that G is a partial cube on the set X. Figure 2.1 A graph and its isometric embedding into Q3. An example of a partial cube and its isometric embedding into the cube Q3 is shown in Figure 2.1. Clearly, a family F of finite subsets of X induces a partial cube on X if and only if for any two distinct subsets P, Q F there is a sequence , R1, . . . , Ri, Ri 1 1 for all 0 , and d P, Q n. The families of sets satisfying condition are known as well graded fam ilies of sets . Note that a sequence Ri satisfying is a shortest path from P to Q in H X and in the subgraph induced by F . Definition 2.3. A family F of arbitrary subsets of X is a wg family well graded family of sets if, for any two distinct subsets P, Q F, the set P Q is finite and there is a sequence , R1, . . . , Ri Ri 1 1 for all 0 P Q n. Example 2.1. The induced graph can be a partial cube on a different set if the family F is not well graded. Consider, for instance, the family , , , of subsets of . The graph induced by this family is a path of length 4 in the cube Q3 cf. Figure 2.2 . Clearly, F is not well graded. On the other hand, as it can be easily seen, any path is a partial cube. 3 Figure 2.2 A nonisometric path in the cube Q3. Any family F of subsets of X defines a graph F, EF , where P Q 1 . Theorem 2.1. The graph GF defined by a family F of subsets of a set X is isomorphic to a partial cube on X if and only if the family F is well graded. Proof. We need to prove sufficiency only. Let S be a fixed set in F. We define a mapping f F Pf X by f R R S for R F. Then d f R , f T R S T S R T . Thus f is an isometric embedding of F into Pf X . Let Ri be a sequence of sets in F such that , , P Q n, and Ri Ri 1

Chunk: It is shown that the class of partial cubes is closed under these operations. Because partial cubes are defined as graphs isometrically embeddable into hypercubes, the theory of partial cubes has a distinctive geometric flavor. The three main structures on a graph semicubes and Djokovi c s and Winkler s relations are defined in terms of the metric structure on a graph. One can say that this theory is a branch of discrete metric geometry. Not surprisingly, geo metric structures play an important role in our treatment of the characterization and construction problems.

Thus, xy uv, a contradiction, since we assumed that . 7 By Theorem 3.2, the relations and coincide on bipartite graphs. For this reason we use the relation in the rest of the paper. Lemma 3.4. Let V, E be a bipartite graph such that all its semicubes are convex sets. Then two edges xy and uv stand in the relation if and only if the corresponding pairs of mutually opposite semicubes form equal partitions of V xy uv . Proof. Necessity We assume that the notation is chosen such that u Wxy and v Wyx. Let z Wxy Wvu. By Lemma 3.1, d z, u d z, v d v, u . Since z, u Wxy and Wxy is convex, we have v Wxy, a contradiction to the assumption that v Wyx. Thus Wxy . Since two opposite semicubes in a bipartite graph form a partition of V , we have Wyx. A similar argument shows that Wxy, if u Wyx and v Wxy. Sufficiency. Follows from the definition of the relation . We need another general property of the relation cf. Lemma 2.2 in . Lemma 3.5. Let P be a shortest path in a graph G. Then no two distinct edges of P stand in the relation . Proof. Let . Then d xi, xj d xi, xj 1 and d xi 1, xj d xi 1, xj 1 , so xi, xi 1 Wxjxj 1. It follows that edges xixi 1 and xjxj 1 do not stand in the relation . The converse statement is true for bipartite graphs we omit the proof a counterexample is the cycle C5 which is not bipartite. Lemma 3.6. Let V, E be a bipartite graph. The following statements are equivalent i All semicubes of G are convex. ii The relation is an equivalence relation on E. Proof. i ii . Follows from Lemma 3.4. ii i . Suppose that is transitive and there is a nonconvex semicube Wab. Then there are two vertices u, v Wab and a shortest path P from u to v that intersects Wba. This path contains two distinct edges e and f joining vertices of semicubes Wab and Wba. The edges e and f stand in the relation to the edge ab. By transitivity of , we have e f. This contradicts the result of Lemma 3.5. Thus all semicubes of G are convex. 8 We now establish some basic properties of partial cubes. Theorem 3.3. Let V, E be a partial cube. Then i G is a bipartite graph. ii Each pair of opposite semicubes form a partition of V . iii All semicubes are convex subsets of V . iv is an equivalence relation on E. Proof. We may assume that G is an isometric subgraph of some hypercube H X , that is, F, EF for a wg family F of finite subsets of X. i It suffices to note that if two sets in H X are connected by an edge then they have different parity. Thus, H X is a bipartite graph and so is G. ii Follows from i and Theorem 3.1. iii Let WAB be a semicube of G. By Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 2.2, we have . Let Q, R WAB and P be a vertex of G such that d Q, P d P, R d Q, R . By Theorem 2.2, Q R P Q R. Since Q, R WAB, we have Q B A Q B and R B A R B, which implies P B Q R B A Q R B S B.

Chunk: an integer lattice is a partial cube. It follows that a finite graph is a partial cube if and only if it is embeddable in some integer lattice. Examples of infinite partial cubes isometrically embeddable into a finite dimensional integer lattice are found in . We call the minimum possible dimension n of an integer lattice Zn, in which a given graph G is isometrically embeddable, its lattice dimension and denote it dimZ G . The lattice dimension of a partial cube can be expressed in terms of maximum matchings in so called semicube graphs . Definition 5.1. The semicube graph Sc G has all semicubes in G as the set of its vertices. Two vertices Wab and Wcd are connected in Sc G if Wab . If G is a partial cube, then condition is equivalent to each of the two equivalent conditions Wba Wcd Wdc Wab, where stands for the proper inclusion. Theorem 5.3. Theorem 1 in . Let G be a finite partial cube. Then dimZ G dimI G M , where M is a maximum matching in the semicube graph Sc G . Example 5.1. Let G be the graph shown in Figure 2.1. It is easy to see that dimI G 3 and dimZ G 2. 15 Example 5.2. Let T be a tree with n edges and m leaves. Then dimI T n and dimZ T m 2 cf. and , respectively . Example 5.3. For the cycle C6 we have see Figure 8.2 dimI C6 dimZ C6 3. 6 Subcubes and Cartesian products Let G be a partial cube. We say that G is a subcube of G if it is an isometric subgraph of G. Clearly, a subcube is itself a partial cube. The converse does not hold a subgraph of a graph G can be a partial cube but not an isometric subgraph of G cf. Example 2.1 . If G is a subcube of a partial cube G, then dimI G dimI G and dimZ G dimZ G . In general, the two inequalities are not strict. For instance, the cycle C6 is an isometric subgraph of the cube Q3 see Figure 8.2 and dimI C6 dimZ C6 dimI Q3 dimZ Q3 3. Semicubes of a partial cube are examples of subcubes. Indeed, by Theo rem 3.4, semicubes are convex subgraphs and therefore isometric. In general, the converse is not true a path connecting two opposite vertices in C6 is an isometric subgraph but not a convex one. Another common way of constructing new partial cubes from old ones is by forming their Cartesian products see for details and proofs . Definition 6.1. Given two graphs V1, E1 and V2, E2 , their Cartesian product G2 has vertex set V2 a vertex u1, u2 is adjacent to a vertex v1, v2 if and only if u1v1 E1 and , or . The operation is associative, so we can write 1 Gi for the Cartesian product of graphs G1, . . . , Gn. A Cartesian product Qn . Then we have dG u, v n X ui, vi . 16 Example 6.1. Let n Pn . Then the Cartesian product of the hypercubes H Xi is isomorphic to the hy percube H Y . The isomorphism is established by the mapping f P1, . . . , Pn 7 n X . Formula yields immediately the following results. Proposition 6.1. Let Hi be isometric subgraphs of graphs Gi for all 1 i n. Then the Cartesian product Qn 1 Gi. Corollary 6.1. The Cartesian product of a finite family of partial cubes is a partial cube. In particular, the integer lattice Zn cf. Examples 2.2 and 2.3 is a partial cube. The results of the next two theorems can be easily extended to arbitrary finite products of finite partial cubes. Theorem 6.1. Let G2 be the Cartesian product of two

Chunk: as follows. Let Lk be the repre sentation of GSp4 C of highest weight k 3, k 3 . We let k, Vk by k GB R GL Vk , where the action on the first factor is via v0, and the action on the second one is via v1. The space of algebraic Hilbert Siegel modular forms of weight k and level N is given by MB k N n f GB Q U0 N Vk GB Q , f k f o , 6 CLIFTON CUNNINGHAM AND LASSINA DEMB EL E where f k x f x , for all x GB Q U0 N . When , we let IB k N n f GB Q GB Q U0 N C f is constant o . Then, the space of algebraic Hilbert Siegel cusp forms of weight k and level N is defined by SB k N MB k N if , MB k N IB k N if . The action of the Hecke algebra on SB k N is given as follows. For any u G Q , write the finite disjoint union U0 N uU0 N a i uiU0 N , and define U0 N uU0 N SB k N SB k N f 7 f k U0 N uU0 N , by f k U0 N uU0 N x X i f xui , x G Q . For any prime p N, let p be a local uniformizer at p. The local Hecke alge bra at p is generated by the Hecke operators T1 p and T2 p corresponding to the double U0 N cosets 1 p and 2 p of the matrices 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 p 0 0 0 0 p and 1 0 0 0 0 p 0 0 0 0 2 p 0 0 0 0 p , respectively. We let TB k N be the Hecke algebra generated by T1 p and T2 p for all primes p N. 1.4. The Jacquet Langlands Correspondence. The Hecke modules Sk N and SB k N are related by the following conjecture known as the Jacquet Langlands Correspondence for symplectic similitude groups. Conjecture 1. The Hecke algebras Tk N and TB k N are isomorphic and there is a compatible isomorphism of Hecke modules Sk N SB k N . It is common, but perhaps not entirely accurate, to attribute this con jecture to Jacquet Langlands. To the best of our knowledge, the correspon dence in this form was first discussed by Ihara Ih 1964 in the case . In Ib 1984 , Ibukiyama provided some numerical evidence. On the other hand, it is appropriate to refer to Conjecture 1 as the Jacquet Langlands Corre spondence for GSp since it is an analogue of the Jacquet Langlands COMPUTING HILBERT SIEGEL MODULAR FORMS 7 Correspondence for GL which relates automorphic representations of the multiplicative group of a quaternion algebra with certain automorphic representations of GL see JL 1970 . Both correspondences are, in turn, special consequences of the principle of functoriality, as expounded by Lang lands. Finally, it appears that Conjecture 1 may soon be a theorem due to the work of So 2008 and the forthcoming book by James Arthur on auto morphic representations of classical groups. 2. The Algorithm In this section, we present the algorithm we used in order to compute the Hecke module of algebraic Hilbert Siegel modular forms. The main assumption in this section is that the class number of the principal genus of GB is 1. We refer to D3 2007 to see how one can relax this condition on the class number. We recall that since B is totally definite, GB satis fies Proposition 1.4 in Gross Gr 1999 . Thus the group GB R is compact modulo its centre, and GB Z O F is finite. For

So far, our algorithm has been implemented only for congruence subgroups of Siegel type.

Indeed, Ramakrishnan and Shahidi RS 2007 recently showed the existence of symmetric cube lifts for non CM elliptic curves E Q to GSp4 Q. And their result should hold for other totally real number fields, with the level structures of the lifts being of Klingen type. Unfortunately, 14 CLIFTON CUNNINGHAM AND LASSINA DEMB EL E those lifts cannot be seen in our current tables. For example, there are modular elliptic curves over Q 5 whose conductors have norm 31, 41 and 49, but the corresponding symmetric cubic lifts do not appear in Table 1. We would like to remedy that in our next implementation.

The academic chunk provided discusses Hilbert eigenforms of weight 4 and how the algorithm implementation for congruence subgroups of Siegel type can be improved in the near future to include more additional level structures such as the Klingen type. This is important, as some lifts, for example, the symmetric cube lifts for non CM elliptic curves E Q to GSp4 Q, cannot be seen in current tables.

DISTRIBUTION OF INTEGRAL FOURIER COEFFICIENTS MODULO PRIMES 5 Next sections are detailed proofs of theorems Section 2 gives a proof of Theorem 1. In Section 3, we give the proofs of Theorem 2, 3, and 4. 2. Proof of Theorem 1 We begin by stating the following theorem proved in . Theorem 2.1 . Let be a non negative integer. Suppose that g z P n qn S 1 2 0 4N , Z q , where is a real Dirichlet character. If p is an odd prime and a positive integer n exists for which gcd ag n , p 1, then at least one of the following is true If 0 , then 1 n X ag n r mod p r,M X logX if r 0 mod p , X if r 0 mod p . There are finitely many square free integers n1, n2, , nt for which g z t X 0 ag nim2 qnim2 mod p . Moreover, if gcd p, 4N 1, o , and l 4Np is a prime with ni l for 1 i t, then l 1 g z is an eigenform modulo p of the half integral weight Hecke operator T l2, , . In particular, we have l 1 g z T l2, , o p 1 l l l 1 l 1 g z mod p . Recall that f z P n qn M 1 2 0 4N , Z q . Thus, to apply Theorem 2.1, we show that there exists a cusp form ef z such that ef z p 1 f z mod p for a prime p 5. Lemma 2.2. Suppose that p 5 is a prime and f z X n qn M 1 2 0 N , Z q . Then, there exists a cusp form ef z S p 1 p 1 1 2 0 N , Z q such that ef z p 1 f z mod p . Proof of Lemma 2.2. For F z M k1 2 0 N , 1 and G z M k2 2 0 N , 2 , let F z , G z 1 k2 2 F z G z k1 2 F z G z . This operator is referred to as a Rankin Cohen 1 bracket, and it was proved in that F z , G z 1 S k1 k2 2 2 0 N , 1 2 , 6 D.

Chunk: qn S 1 2 0 N , Z q . Lemma 2.3 see Chapter 3 in . Suppose that g z P n qn S 1 2 0 N , has coefficients in OK, the algebraic integers of some number field K. Furthermore, suppose that 1 and that m OK is an ideal norm M. Then, a positive proportion of the primes Q 1 mod 4MN has the property that g z T Q2, , 0 mod m . Then a positive proportion of the primes Q 1 mod 4MN has the property that g z T Q2, , 2g z mod m . We can now prove Theorem 1. Proof of Theorem 1. From Lemma 2.2, there exists a cusp form ef z S p 1 p 1 1 2 0 N , Z q such that ef z p 1 f z mod p . Note that, for F z P n qn Mk 1 2 0 N , and each prime Q N, the half integral weight Hecke operator T Q2, , is defined as F z T Q2, k, P aF Q2n Q n Q Qk 1aF n Q2 Q2k 1aF n Q2 qn, DISTRIBUTION OF INTEGRAL FOURIER COEFFICIENTS MODULO PRIMES 7 where n n 1 k n and aF n Q2 0 if Q2 n. If F z T Q2, k, 0 mod p for a prime Q N, then we have aF Q2 Qn Q Qn Q Qk 1aF Qn Q2 Q2k 1aF Qn Q2 aF Q3n 0 mod p for every positive integer n such that gcd Q, n 1. Thus, we have the following by Lemma 2.3 1 n X a n 0 mod p and gcd p, n 1 X. We apply Theorem 2.1 with ef z . Then the purpose of the remaining part of the proof is to show the following if gcd p, 4N 1, an odd prime ldivides some ni, and p 1 f z t X 0 a nim2 qnim2 mod p , then p l 1 l l 1 N or l N. We assume that there exists a prime l1 such that l1 n1, p l1 1 l1 l1 1 N and l N. We also assume that n1 for every i, 2 i t 1. Then, we can take a prime li for each i, 2 i t 1, such that li ni and li n1. For convention, we define n 2 1 n 1 2 8 if n is odd, 0 otherwise, and Q d d Q for a prime Q. Let d Qt 1 li d . We take a prime such that n1 n1 1. If we denote the twist of ef z by ef z and the twist of ef z by ef z , then ef 2 z ef z 2 X gcd m, Q j 2 lj 1 a n1m2 qn1m2 mod p and ef z S p 1 p 1 1 2 0 N 2 2 , Z q see Chapter 3 in . Note that gcd N 2 2, p gcd N 2 2, l1 1. Thus, ef z ef z T l2 1, p 1 p 1 , satisfies the formula of Theorem 2.1 for both of o 1 and o 1. This results in a contradiction since ef z ef z T l2 1, p 1 p 1 , 0 mod p and p 5. Thus, we complete the proof. 8 D. CHOI 3. Proofs of Theorem 2, 3, and 4 3.1. Proof of Theorem 2.

Serre obtained the p adic limit of the integral Fourier coefficients of modular forms on SL2 Z for , 3, 5, 7. In this paper, we extend the result of Serre to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight on 0 4N for , 2, 4. The proof is based on linear relations among Fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight. As applications of our main result, we obtain congruences on various modular objects, such as those for Borcherds exponents, for Fourier coefficients of quotients of Eisentein series and for Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms on the Maass Space.

We call t a regular cusp if r t 0 see Chapter IV. 1. of for a more general definition of a regular cusp . Remark 1.1. Our definition of a regular cusp is different from the usual one. Let U4N be the set of all inequivalent regular cusps of 0 4N . Note that the genus of 0 4N is zero if and only if 1 N 4. Let M 1 2 0 4N be the space of weakly holomorphic modular forms of weight 1 2 on 0 4N and let M0 1 2 0 N denote the set of f z M 1 2 0 N such that the constant term of its q expansion at each cusp is zero. Let Up be the operator defined by f Up z X pn qn. Let OL be the ring of integers of a number field L with a prime ideal p OL. For f z P af n qn and g z P ag n qn L q 1, q we write f z g z mod p if and only if af n ag n p for every integer n. With these notations we state the following theorem. Theorem 1. For , 2, 4 consider f z X n qn M0 1 2 0 4N L q 1, q . Suppose that p OL is any prime ideal such that p p 4N . Then the linear span of the mod p reductions of the Up M 1 2 0 4N is the ring of vectors in MN OL of the form g z mod p for some a MN OL such that a is regular wth respect to p(d). 2. Formulation of the Main Results We start by formulating the main results of the paper. Theorem 2.1. Let L be a number field with a prime ideal p OL and let m and n be positive integers, both even or both odd, such that gcd(m,n) 1. Suppose that f z X n qn and g z X n qn are modular forms of weight 1 2 on 0 N for some integer N. Set f P = f qn mod p and g P = g qn mod p . Then we have
fP = gP mod p if and only if there exists an element a P OL such that a is regular with respect to p(d) and g = af Up for some f 2.

The vector space L 1 k, n is explicitly described in terms of the principal part of negative weight modular forms in . These results were extended in to the groups 0 N of genus zero.

Chunk: Upm z mod p and k k mod p 1 . Theorem 4.4 implies that there exists a positive integer b such that F Up2b z 0 mod p . Thus, we have shown so far that if p p2, all the Fourier coefficients of 1 F z Upm 2b are p integral. Repeat this argument to complete our claim. 4.2. Proof of Theorem 2. Theorem 2 can be derived from Theorem 3.1 by taking a special modular form. Proof of Theorem 2. Take a positive integer land a positive even integer u such that 3 2 p 2 pu 1 2 pm p l p 1 2. Let F z 4N,3 p z R4N z pu and G z Ep 1 z lf z pm p . Since Ep 1 z 1 mod p , we have F z G z X ,3 p z R4N z n qnpu ! X n qnm p ! mod p . If Fourier coefficients of f z at each cusp are p integral, then F G 2 t z qr t X n qn t ! qr t X n qn t ! qr t X n qn t ! qpu t X ,3 p z R4N z n qpu t ! mod p for t . Since aF z G z a 4N,3 p z R4N z af af pu m p mod p , at F z G z at 4N,3 p z R4N z at f mod p for t , for large u, the Residue Theorem implies Theorem 2 by letting . Therefore it is enough to check a p integral property of Fourier coefficients of f z at each cusp take a positive integer e such that z ef z is a holomorphic modular form, where THE p ADIC LIMIT OF WEAKLY HOLOMORPHIC MODULAR FORMS 15 z q Q 1 qn 24. Note that the q expansions of j4N z and 4N,12e z at each cusp are p integral. Thus implies that z ef z 12e 4N X z n 4N,12e z . Moreover, cn is p integral since j4N z n 4N,12e z q 12e 4N n O q 12e 4N n 1 and f z OL q, q 1 . Note that p 4N since 1 N 4 and p 5 is a prime. So Fourier coefficients of j4N z , N,12e z and 1 z at each cusp are p integral. This completes our claim. 5. Proof of Theorem 3 Theorem 3 follows from Theorem 1 and Theorem 2.1. Proof of Theorem 3.

Chunk: spaces H Hom F pB A F p 1B A , A Hom psH A , H A Proof. Let A be a differential graded subalgebra of A such that A 1, A dA0 A 1. There is an isomorphism of vector spaces Hom F qB A F q 1B A , A Hom F qB A F q 1B A , A . 4 Since A , there is an isomorphism H0 Hom F qB A F q 1B A , A Hom sH A , H A . Therefore we obtain the proposition. 4 Proof of Theorem 1.1 We give the proof of theorem 1.1 in this section. There is a differential graded subalgebra of A, A, such that A A H A by the inclusion. Then we obtain the isomorphism of algebras H Hom B A , A H Hom B A , A by proposition 3.2. Therefore it suffices to verify the theorem in the case . The following result is due to Chen. Theorem 4.1 Chen . H LM H Hom B A , A . Proof. We define C LM Hom B A , A by 1, , n Z Z 1 n. Let FpC LM be a filtration of C LM such that FpCr LM r LM for some Cq M , q p, r q . Let Er p,q be the associated spectral sequence. Define a filtration of Hom B A , A by FpHom B A , A . It can be easily shown that preserves the filtrations of C LM and Hom B A , A . On E2 level, the map Hp M Hq M Hp A Hq B A is given by 1 2 7 7 Z 1 1, , n 7 Z 2 Z 1 n . Theorem 3.1 asserts that this is an isomorphism. Therefore we obtain the theorem. Lemma 4.2. H Hom B A , A H d Hom B A , A . 5 Proof. We define a chain map P Hom B A , A Hom B A , A by P 1, , n Z M 1, , n . Define a filtration of Hom B A , A by FpHom B A , A . The map P preserves those filtrations. On E2 level, the map P Hd p A Hq B A Hp A Hq B A is given by 7 7 Z M . This is isomorphic and we obtain the lemma. Proof of theorem 1.1. We can verify that H LM is isomorphic to H Hom B A , A as vector spaces by composing the maps in theorem 4.1 and lemma 4.2. We can also verify that there is an isomorphism of associative, commutative algebras. Indeed, the cup product of Hom B A , A on E2 level Hd p A Hq B A Hd s A Ht B A H2d p s A Hq t B A is given by a g b h 7 1 d p q d s a b g h, where g h satisfies g h 1, , n X i g 1, , i h i 1, , n . Then the following theorem asserts that the loop product and the cup product coincide on E2 level. Theorem 4.3 Cohen Jones Yan . Let M be a simply connected manifold. Then Er p,q becomes an algebra and converges to H LM as algebras. On E2 level, the product Hp M Hq LM Hs M Ht LM Hp q d M Hs t LM is given by a g b h 1 d s p q d a b gh where a Hp M , b Hs M , g Hq M , h Ht M , a b is the intersec tion product and gh is the Pontryagin product.

Composing these maps and the cup product, we can define a bracket on H0 Hom F pB A , A by 1, 2 P P 1B 1 P 1B 2 H0 Hom F p 1B A , A . 12 Take 2g closed 1 forms on M, 1, , g, 1, g, such that R M i ij. Let E r p.q denote the spectral sequence of Hom B A , A associated with F pB A . Notice that the cyclic group Z pZ acts on E 1 p, pH1 A , R by 1, , p 2, , p, 1 where is a generator of Z pZ.

Proposition 6.4. The following diagram commutes for p, q 1 Jp Jp 1 Jq Jq 1 E p, p E q, q , y , y Jp q 2 Jp q 1 E p q 2, p q 2 Proof. Take 1 x p x FpC0 LM , 1 y q y FqC0 LM . Take 2g curves in M, ai, bi, as in Figure 1. Assume that i and j, ak, or bk, intersect transversally for any i, j, k. Also assume that j and ak, or bk, intersect transversally for any j, k. Assume that all the intersection points are distinct. Then for any i, j, k, we can take each tubular neighborhoods of ai and bi so that it does not include some neighborhoods of intersection points of j and k. We fix such neighborhoods of intersection points and denote them by Up for each p. We can also take a tubular neighborhood of the diagonal map from M to M M outside those neighborhoods of intersection points of i and j for any i, j i.e. N i S1 p 1 i Up j S1 p 1 j Up , i, j. Here N denotes the tubular neighborhood of the diagonal map. Thom class of this tubular neighborhood satisfies Z i 1 i Up j 1 j Up p i, j , where p i, j is the intersecion number of i and j at p. 13 Fig. 1 a1 b1 a1 b1 a1 b1 Define e C0 LM C1 LM by e t t . Let k, 1 k n, be differential forms on M which has its support inside the tubular neighborhoods of ai and bi.

Proof of theorem 6.1. We obtain the following isomorphism of Lie algebras by proposition 6.4. lim p R Hom B A , A . To obtain the isomorphism of Lie algebras H0 Hom B A , A H0 Hom B H M , H M , we introduce the following lemma, which asserts the formality of the compact K ahler manifolds. Lemma 6.8 ddcLemma, Deligne Griffiths Morgan Sullivan . Let X be a compact K ahler manifold and . If is a differential form on X such that d 0 and dc 0, and such that d , then ddc for some . Cor. There are quasi isomorphisms of differential graded algebras X, d kerdc, d H dc X , 0 . Notice that a closed oriented surface endowed with a complex structure become a K ahler manifolds for the dimensional reason. Therefore the following lemma completes the proof of the theorem. 16 Lemma 6.9. If f A1 A2 is a quasi isomorphism of differential graded algebras, then the map induced by f H0 Hom B A1 , A 1 H0 Hom B A2 , A 2 is an isomorphism. Proof. It suffices to verify that the map induced by f f H0 Hom F pB A1 , A 1 H0 Hom F pB A2 , A 2 is an isomorphism for any p. On E1 level, the map induced by f Hom sH A1 , H A1 Hom sH A2 , H A2 is an isomorphism because f is quasi isomorphism.

Chunk: previous calculations restricted to Neveu Schwarz states, it was then shown how the treatment of Ramond states poses no additional difficulties. While the bosonic calculations of have, in conjunction with supersymmetry, already established the equivalence of the massless four point amplitudes derived in the pure spinor and RNS formalisms, it would be interesting to make contact between the results of sections 4.2 4.3 and two loop amplitudes involving Ramond states as computed in the RNS formalism see for example . The assistance of a computer algebra system seems indispensible in explicitly evaluat ing pure spinor superspace integrals. To avoid excessive use of custom made algorithms, it would be desirable to implement these calculations in a wider computational framework particular adapted to field theory calculations . The methods outlined in this paper should be easily applicable to future higher loop amplitude expressions derived from the pure spinor formalism, and, it is hoped, to other superspace integrals. Acknowledgements The author would like to thank Louise Dolan for discussions, and Carlos Mafra for valuable correspondence. This work is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, grant no. DE FG01 06ER06 01, Task A. 16 A. Reduction to kinematic bases In calculating scattering amplitudes one encounters kinematic factors which are Lorentz invariant polynomials in the momenta, polarisations and or spinor wavefunctions of the scattered particles. It can be a non trivial task to simplify such expressions, taking into account the on shell identities P i , k2 , ki , , and, in the case of fermions, re arrangements stemming from Fierz identities. More generally, one would like to know how many independent combinations of some given fields subject to on shell identitites there are, and how to reduce an arbitrary expres sion with respect to some chosen basis. This appendix outlines methods to address these problems, with an emphasis on algorithms which can easily be transferred to a computer algebra system. These methods are not limited to dealing with pure spinor calculations but the scope will be restricted to amplitudes of four massless vector or spinor particles in ten dimensions. A.1 Four bosons It is not difficult to reduce polynomials in the momenta and polarisations to a canonical form. The momentum conservation constraint P i for example k4 , all k2 i are set to zero, and one of the two remaining quadratic combinations of momenta is eliminated for example s23 s12 s13, where sij ki kj . Then all products ki i are set to zero, and one extra k product is replaced when eliminating k4, the replacement is k3 4 k1 k2 4 . The remaining monomials are then independent. This is at least the case with the low powers of momenta encountered in the calculations of sections 3 and 4, where there are enough spatial directions for all momenta polarisations to be linearly independent. The implementation of these reduction rules on a computer is straightforward. The easiest way to obtain scalars which are also invariant under the gauge symmetry ki i is to start with expressions constructed from the field strengths F ab a b i . For the one loop calculations of section 3.1, the relevant basis consists of gauge invariant scalars containing only the four field strengths F1 . . . F4. One finds six independent combinations, Tr F1F2F3F4 Tr F1F2F4F3 Tr F1F3F2F4 Tr F1F2 Tr F3F4 Tr F1F3 Tr F2F4 Tr F1F4 Tr F2F3 In the two loop calculations of section 4.1, all monomials have two more momenta. There are sixteen independent gauge invariant scalars of the form kkF1F2F3F4, and twelve of them may be constructed from the previous basis by multiplication with s12 and s13 F1F2F3F4 , F1F2F3F4 , etc. One choice for the additional four is F1 F2 k3 Tr F3F4 F1 F4 k2 Tr F2F3 F1 F3 k2 Tr F2F4 F2 F3 k4 Tr F1F4 . 17 As an example application of the computer

Chunk: representation theory that the correlator is uniquely characterised, up to normalisation, by its symmetry. To see this, note that the spinor products 3 and 5 transform in Sym3 S 1 . . . 5 Alt5 S . Here, and are taken to be in the S irrep of SO 1,9 , with Dynkin label . The tensor product of these contains only one copy of the trivial representation. This applies to any spinors , which means that the pure spinor property cannot be essential to the derivation of the tensorial identities. The use of the pure spinor constraint merely allows for simpler derivations of the same identities. As an illustration of this approach, consider the correlator of eq. . Leaving the momenta aside for the moment by setting F, the task is to compute mnpq r s u1 nab bu2 qu3 su4 . After applying two Fierz transformations, 1 16 mnpq r c nab jkl u1 s c bu2 1 3! 16 mnpq r cde nab jkl u1 s cde bu2 1 2 5! 16 mnpq r cdefg nab jkl u1 s cdefg bu2 1 3! 16 u3 q jkl su4 , one obtains a combination of the fundamental correlators listed in , and . A reliable evaluation of the numerous index symmetrisations is made possible by the use of a computer algebra program. In doing these calculations with Mathematica, an essential tool is the GAMMA package , expanding the products of gamma matrices in a k basis. The result consists of two parts, F F , with F 1 560 u1 mpru2 u3 au4 7 720 a p m r u1 iu2 u3 iu4 . . . 1 1680 u1 ai1i2u2 u3 mpri1i2u4 92 terms F 1 1209600 i1...i7 mpr u1 i1...i7u2 u3 au4 . . . 1 604800 ampri1...i6 u1 i3...i9u2 u3 i1i2i7i8i9u4 34 terms The epsilon tensors in the second part can be eliminated using the fact that the ui are chiral spinors If all the indices on k ui are contracted into an epsilon tensor, one uses i1...ik j1...jk j1...jk 1 2k k 1 k! i1...ik , where ! i0...i9 i0...i9. More generally, if all but r indices of k ui are contracted, i1...ik j1...jk p1...prj1...jk 1 2k k 1 k! k ! k r ! pr...p1 i1...ir ir 1...i k . 4 The result of these manipulations is F 1 560 u1 mpru2 u3 au4 1 280 p r u1 amiu2 u3 iu4 . . . 9 11200 u1 i1i2i3u2 u3 ampri1i2i3u4 53 terms Note that while the epsilon terms in the basic correlator formulae were easily obtained from the delta terms by using Poincar e duality, this cannot be done here in any obvious way.

Choosing a gauge where A 0, the on shell identities 2D A m Am , D W 1 4 mn Fmn have been used to derive recursive relations for the fermionic expansion A n 1 n 1 m A n 1 m , A n mW n 1 , W n 1 2n mn mA n 1 n , where f n 1 n! n 1 D 1 D nf . These recursion relations were explicitly solved in , reducing the fermionic expansion to a simple repeated application of the derivative operator mqp p A 2k 2k ! Ok mq q , A 2k 1 2k 1 ! Ok mq q u . With this solution at hand, one has all ingredients to evaluate the kinematic factor for the three cases of zero, two, or four fermionic states. 3.1 Review four bosons The kinematic factor involving four bosons was considered in and this calculation will now be reviewed briefly. First, note that the outcome is not fixed by symmetry The result must be gauge invariant and therefore expressible in terms of the field strengths F1 . . . F4. The cyclic symmetrisation in yields expressions symmetric in F2, F3, F4, and acting on scalars constructed from the Fi only, the symmetrisation is equivalent to complete symmetrisation in all labels . Thus the result must be a linear combination of the 1Thanks to Carlos Mafra for pointing this out. 8 two gauge invariant symmetric F 4 scalars, namely the single trace Tr F 1F2F3F4 and double trace Tr F 1F2 Tr F3F4 , leaving one relative coefficient to be determined. Since all four states are of the same kind, one may first evaluate the correlator for one labelling and then carry out the cyclic symmetrisation K 4B 1 A1 mW2 nW3 F4,mn 4B cycl . The different ways to saturate 5 result in a sum of terms of the form A A 1 mW B 2 nW C 3 F D 4,mn E with A B C , B, C odd, D even A1 mW2 nW3 F4,mn . Note that X1310 and X1130 are related by exchange of the labels 2 and 3. This exchange can be carried out after computing the correlator, an operation which will in the following be denoted by 23. Using for the superfield expansions and replacing m ikm, one obtains X3110 , t pq u rs a amn , 1 nF 2 pqF 3 rsF 4 tu X1112 , m pq a rs n atu , 1 nF 2 pqF 3 rsF 4 tu X1310 , t ma u rs n apq . The method outlined in section 2.2 is readily applicable to these correlators.

The structure of the correlator X1310 is such that the contribution to the final result from the exchange of a single particle can be isolated . This is particularly useful for the evaluation of higher point functions, for which the exchange of more than one particle may be essential. 3.2 Review Three fermions 3.2.1 Review four-boson analysis 3.2.1.1 The correlator X1112 has the structure Tr F1F2F3F4 111,2 22,3 33 44 with all indices summed over .

Chunk: F 1F2 Tr F3F4 1 15360t8F 4 , in agreement with the expressions derived in the RNS and Green Schwarz for malisms. 9 3.2 Four fermions The four fermion kinematic factor could be evaluated in the same way as in the four boson case by summing up all terms XABCD, A B C , now with A, B, C even and D odd. Note however that this time, the outcome is fixed by symmetry The cyclic symmetrisation in leads to a completely symmetric dependence on u2, u3, u4, and therefore to a completely antisymmetric dependence on u2, u3, u4. Acting on scalars of the form k2u1u2u3u4, antisymmetrising over is equivalent to antisymmetrising over , and there is only one completely antisymmetric k2u1u2u3u4 scalar. Without further calculation, one can infer that the kinematic factor is proportional to that scalar, K4F 1 u1 k3u2 u3 k1u4 u1 k2u3 u2 k1u4 u1 k2u4 u2 k1u3 , which of course agrees with the RNS amplitude see e.g. , eq. . 3.3 Two bosons, two fermions In evaluating for two bosons and two fermions, the cyclic symmetrisations affect whether the W and F superfields contribute bosons or fermions. Only the label of the A superfield stays unaffected, and one has to choose whether it should contribute a boson or a fermion. Since its fermionic expansion starts with the bosonic polarisation vector, A1, 1 , the calculation can be simplified by choosing a labelling where particle 1 is a fermion. Of course, the final result must be independent of this choice. The assignment of the other three labels is then irrelevant and will be chosen as f1f2b3b4. Writing out the cyclic permutations, two of the three terms are essentially the same because they are related by interchange of the labels 3 and 4. The kinematic factor is then K2B2F 1 loop f1f2b3b4 1 34 A even 1 mW even 2 nW odd 3 F even 4,mn A even 1 mW odd 3 nW odd 4 F odd 2,mn . Unlike in the four fermion calculation, the result is not fixed by symmetry. There are five independent ku1u2F3F4 scalars see appendix A, eq. A.6 , denoted by C1 . . . C5, and there are two independent combinations of these scalars with the required symmetry. Expanding the superfields and collecting terms with 5, the first line yields a combination of terms XABCD with A, B, D odd and C even. There is only one 5 combination coming from the second line, which will be denoted by X 2111 24 X2111 K2B2F 1 1 34 X4010 X2210 X2030 X2012 X 2111 , with the correlators 3 c k4 m 4 n X4010 , a apq pu1 mu2 n bc 3 ek4 m 4 n X2210 , a au1 m bc cu2 n de 3 ek4 m 4 n X2030 , a au1 mu2 n bc cde 3 c k4 mk4 d 4 e X2012 , a au1 mu2 n bc nde X 3 c k4 d 4 ek2 m X 2111 , X a au1 m bc n de nu2 10 The numerical coefficient in X 2111 includes a sign coming from the , u ordering there is an odd number of s between u1 and u2. Evaluating these expressions as outlined in section 2.2, the spinor wavefunctions ui present no complication. The last part takes the simplest form One finds a au1 m bc n de nu2 1 240 2 bc m d u1 e u2 b m u1 c deu2 and therefore X b m u1 c deu2 d m u1 e bcu2 . The result for X4010 is bq m a 1 480 2 aq m b u1 cu2 nd m u1 d b 4 and there is no dependence on e. The result for X2210 is 2 m ab cu2 d b u1 mu2 c nu2 de and similarly there is no dependence on e. The final calculation is X 2030 bq v 3 480 a p q u b u1 d e u2 d b 4 . There is a similar cancellation of e-dependence as in the previous calculation. So, the result for these kinematic factors is C1 . . . C5 which of course agrees with the RNS amplitude see e.g. , eq. .3.3 , and the loop amplitude see eq. , e.g. , .7.3. 3.5 Three fermions The three fermion kinematic factor is obtained by summing up the terms XABC with A even, B odd, and C odd, and is evaluated using the same techniques as in the other cases. Only the calculation for the four fermion kinematic factor involves some new features, as the symmetry under cyclic permutation is not sufficient to

Chunk: and re evaluate the hadronic matrix elements. As a by product, one can compare the results by the diquark picture with that by the three valence quark picture. It may help us to better understand the diquark picture and its application range. The advantage is obvious, that we only concern the inclusive processes in terms of the optical theorem when calculating the lifetime. Therefore, we do not need to deal with the hadronization to light hadrons. The only non perturbative effects come from the wave function of the heavy baryon. Moreover, since there are two heavy quarks in the baryon, the relativistic effects are not so significant and the framework of non relativistic harmonic oscillator model might lead to a reasonable result. Moreover, at the quark level, we carry out similar calculations as that in the literature, but we keep some new operators which are CKM suppressed and contribute to the lifetime. They appear at the non spectator scattering at order of 1 m3c in heavy quark expansion HQE . Later, our numerical results show that their contributions are indeed very tiny to make any substantial contributions. All the concerned parameters in the model are obtained by fitting data, therefore we avoid some theoretical uncertainties and obtain reasonable results. Comparing these results with data, we may gain information about the the whole picture. Our paper is organized as follows. In Section.II we derive the formulation for the lifetimes of cc, cc and cc which include the non spectator effects. In Section.III, we use a simple model, i.e. the harmonic oscillator, to estimate the hadronic matrix elements. In Section.IV we present our numerical results along with the values of all the input parameters. The last section is devoted to our conclusion and discussion. II. FORMULATION FOR LIFETIMES OF cc, cc , cc A. Spectator Contribution to Lifetimes of cc, cc , cc The lifetime is determined by the inclusive decays. Thus one can use the optical theorem to obtain the total width lifetime of the heavy hadron by calculating the absorptive part of the forward scattering amplitude. 3 The total width is then written as HQ X 1 mHQ Im Z , where . 1 mQ is the expansion parameter, and the non local operator T is expanded as a sum of local operators and the corresponding Wilson coefficients include terms with increasing powers of 1 mQ. Definitely, the lowest dimen sional term dominates in the limit mQ and it is the dimension three operator cc. The total width of a charmed hadron Hc is determined by Im with a proper normalization . Hc f G2 Fm5 c 192 3 VCKM 2 c3 f c5 f m2c X i c i 6 f m3 c O 1 m4 c , where the coefficients ci f depend on the masses of the internal quarks in the loop. The coefficient c3 f has been calculated to one loop order whereas the coefficient c5 f is evaluated at the tree level . VCKM is the Cabibbo Kabayashi Maskawa mixing matrix elements and G is the gluonic field strength tensor. Since the third term involves light quarks, it can be different for charmed hadrons with various light flavors. Thus, the difference appears at the 1 m3 c order and in the hadronic matrix elements of four quark operators. The contributions at orders higher than 1 m3 c are neglected. To the lowest order, the main contribution comes from the heavy quark charm quark decays, while the light flavors are treated as spectators. The contributions are due to the semileptonic and the nonleptonic decays as follows c s X , c s l X q q u,d,s c s qq The semileptonic and nonleptonic decay rates of the c quark up to order 1 m2 c has been evaluated by many authors , and here we would directly use their results. 4 B.

Chunk: the doubly charmed baryons, because a reflects the coupling between two charm quarks, we set it to be the same as that for J . a reflects the coupling of the light quark with these two charm quark, thus we can reasonably set it to be the same as a in D mesons. With these parameters as input, the lifetimes of the doubly charmed baryons can be evaluated out see TABLE.I , if the non spectator effects are taken into account. V. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION In this work, we evaluate the lifetimes of doubly charmed baryons with the non spectator effects being properly taken into account. As argued in the introduction, to evaluate the lifetimes the total widths , only the inclusive processes are concerned, and then the non perturbative effects are all from the wavefunctions of the doubly charmed baryons. Due to existence of the two heavy charm quarks, the non relativistic harmonic oscillator model should apply in this case. Mainly, we carefully calculate the contribution of non perturbative effects to the lifetimes in the model, which are closely related to the bound states of the baryons. Our numerical results indicate that the non spectator contributions to the lifetimes of 11 cc, cc and cc are substantial. The non spectator contributions to the width of cc are mainly from the WE diagrams the PI diagrams which contribute are CKM suppressed , since the WE contribution is constructive, therefore the lifetime of cc is much suppressed. By contraries, for c and cc, the non spectator contributions are mainly from the PI diagrams and the net effect is destructive. It is noted that for cc there still are Cabibbo suppressed WE diagrams, but for cc there are only PI diagrams. Therefore the predicted lifetime of cc is larger than that of other two baryons. We also employ other values for parameters a , a and find that the resultant values can vary within 20 uncertainty. Our results are cc 0.25 ps cc 0.67 ps and cc 0.21 ps. These are generally consistent with the results obtained by Kiselev et al. and Guberina et al. , even though they used different models for calculating the hadronic matrix elements. Concretely, they used the diquark picture and attributed the non perturbative effects into the wavefunction of the diaquark at origin. Kiselev et al. gave cc 0.16 0.22 ps cc 0.40 0.65 ps and cc 0.24 0.28. Although all the theoretical predictions based on different models agree with each other, they are obviously one order larger than the upper limit of the measured value on the lifetime of cc 0.033 ps by the SELEX collaboration . This deviation, as suggested by some authors, may come from experiments . So far the difference between theoretical predictions and experimental data may imply some unknown physics mechanisms which drastically change the value, if the future experiment, say at LHCb, confirms the measure ment of the SELEX. Recently, several groups have studied the possibility of doubly heavy baryon production at hadron collider LHC and future linear collider ILC and the effective field theories for two heavy quarks system are also further investigated . We are expecting the new data from more accurate experiments at LHC and ILC to improve our theoretical framework and determine if there are contributions from new physics beyond the standard model.

This is illustrated in Figure 10, where the position of the observer at pulse maximum is indicated, and the axis of the mag netic pole is shown. The disruption of the disc by the magnetic field at the outer disc is illustrated and part of the disc co rotating with the magnetosphere is shown. At a corotation radius, Rc 0.500 0.227log M2 M1 3 1010 cm , the material is ro tating at a velocity of , in good agreement with the observations. Also, a rotation velocity of 600 km s 1 was measured from the spectra and the radial distance from the star to the ring of material was found to be 3 1010 cm, which is similar to b, for a white dwarf mass of 0.5 M Keplerian motion about the white dwarf had to be assumed in these calculations . At this radius, the accretion curtain is also rotating at a velocity of 2 Rco Pspin 500 km s 1. 6 10 12 ergs cm 2 s 1 64 integrated over one spin cycle of the original line fluxes that is contained in the average c 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000 000 Spectroscopic Study of the IP EX Hydrae in Quiescence 9 subtracted profile of H shows radial velocity variations with the spin period. Assuming that H and H also show a similar flux variation H and H spin tomograms also show a low velocity s wave but this result is not secured due to poor quality of data , the total line fluxes showing radial velocity variations with the spin period can be estimated to be 2 10 11 ergs cm 2 s 1 for the three emission lines. This is 2 10 of the total disc flux Eisenbart et al. 2002 , suggesting that only part of the ring coro tates with the white dwarf while the rest of the material may be in volved in a near Keplerian motion this is a rough comparison since the flux is integrated over one spin cycle for H , H and H in our data whereas Eisenbart et al. derived their total flux values from one spectrum over the wavelength range 912 24000 A . While some of the ring material co rotates with the accre tion curtains i.e. remains in the disc rather than being immedi ately channeled along the field lines , some is channeled along the field lines at 500 km s 1 towards the white dwarf. There is also some material that overflows the ring and attaches onto the mag netic field lines. The overflow stream hits the magnetosphere, prob ably causing a second bright spot on the slowly rotating magneto sphere Figure 10 . The overflow stream is irradiated by the white dwarf in its inner regions close to the white dwarf the regions fac ing the white dwarf . This results in the HVC emission being ob scured at 98 0.4 0.9, which are phases where the stream is viewed from behind opposite the side facing the white dwarf, hid ing the irradiated inner regions. HVC emission from the stream is blueshifted when that from the narrow s wave component shows maximum redshift. Near 98 0.25 the two s waves intersect, ex plaining the asymmetry in the brightness of the s wave seen near 98 0.25 Figure 4 . The overflow stream curls nearly behind the white dwarf and it is truncated by the field when the upper magnetic pole is facing the stream. Ferrario Wickramasinghe and Ferrario, Wickramas inghe King showed that in IPs the accretion curtain below the orbital plane can contribute in the radial velocities of a system if it can be seen either through the central hole of the truncated disc, or from

These queries capture the essential points of information from the chunk about Hellier et al.'s motion compatible with an accretion funnel, the significance and calculation of the corotation radius, and the connection between the radial distance and Keplerian motion in relation to EX Hya.

The data were prewhitened by the orbital frequency and are displayed in the third panels from the top. Window spectra are plotted below the amplitude spectra bottom panels . spectra were flux calibrated using observations of the standard star LTT3218. 3 THE RADIAL VELOCITIES It is widely accepted that in a canonical CV, the high velocity emis sion line wings are formed in the inner parts of the accretion disc orbiting close to the white dwarf and thus should reflect its orbital motion Shafter 1983 Shafter Szkody 1984 Shafter 1985 . In IPs, however, high velocity emission line wings are formed in the gas streaming towards the white dwarf at high velocities Hellier et al. 1987 Ferrario Wickramasinghe 1993 . The ra dial velocities were determined by measuring the wings of the H and H emission lines from the 1991 data 24 and 25 04 91 the data obtained on the 29th was not added since EX Hya had not fully recovered from outburst and the wings of H , H and H emission lines from the 2001 data using the Gaussian Convolution which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in As tronomy AURA c 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000 000 Spectroscopic Study of the IP EX Hydrae in Quiescence 3 Figure 2.

The data were prewhitened by and are shown in the third panel from the top. A window spectrum is shown at the bottom. Scheme GCS, Schneider Young 1980 Shafter Szkody 1984 Shafter 1985 . The GCS method convolves each spectrum with two identical Gaussian, one in the red wing and one in the blue wing. The separation between the two Gaussians is 2 . Care was taken not to include regions far out in the wings where the continuum be gins to dominate by choosing reasonable values of the width of the Gaussians and . Twelve standard Gaussian band passes were used with values ranging from 3500 to 100 km s 1 and corre sponding width values from 1200 to 100 km s 1. 3.1 Period Searches The radial velocities were Fourier transformed using the Discrete Fourier Transform DFT algorithm to search for any periods in the data Deeming 1975 Kurtz 1985 . The H and H amplitude spectra from 1991 24 and 25 April are shown in Figure 1 and the H amplitude spectra from 2001 are shown in Figure 2. A prominent peak at a frequency corresponding to the 98 minute orbital frequency, , is observed in all the emission lines. Second in strength to the orbital frequency is the spin frequency, , of the narrow s wave component NSC 900,1200 km s 1 Figures 1 and 2 . The third panels from the top in Figures 1 and 2 show the data after prewhitening by . Power at is clearly present. The spin frequency was not detected at high values of 3000,3500 km s 1 where it is most expected since at these velocities the material is quite close to the white dwarf and its emis sion is expected to be modulated at the white dwarf spin period . It was also not present in H and H radial velocities of 2001. The amplitude of relative to was found to be 81 for H , 64 for H and 18 for H . 4 ORBITAL VARIATIONS OF THE EMISSION LINES The data were phase binned on the orbital ephemeris of Hellier Sprouts , .94179

Chunk: 0.068233846 E, where E is the number of orbital cycles and T is the time of mid eclipse. This ephemeris is defined by the zero point of mid eclipse, where minimum intensity is at phase 0.0. This means that for the radial velocities, maximum blueshift is perpendicular to the line of centres, at phase 0.75, meaning that spectroscopic phase zero oc curs at the blue to red crossing of the emission line radial velocity curve. 40 phase bins were used to produce the radial velocities. 4.1 Orbital Tomograms and Trailed Spectra The H , H and H Doppler tomograms were computed using the Back Projection Method BPM with the application of a fil ter, and the Maximum Entropy Method MEM Marsh Horne 1988 Marsh 1988 Horne 1991 Spruit 1998 . The BPM Doppler maps are shown in Figure 3 and those constructed using MEM are shown in Figure 4. Error in ephemerides both orbital and spin is sufficiently small to phase all of our data accurately on the orbital and spin cycles. A velocity amplitude of the primary, 2 km s 1 from our radial velocity measurements and that of the secondary, 35 km s 1, taken from Vande Putte et al. and Beuermann et al. , were used to fix the positions of the Roche lobe and the stream trajectories on the tomograms. A secondary mass, .10 0.01 M for EX Hya was derived from the up to date secondary mass period relation of Smith Dhillon . The mass of the primary, M1, was then determined from the above values using K1 , and was found to be 0.50 0.05 M . The H , H and HeI 4471 Doppler tomograms Figure 3 and 4 show strong emission at the bright spot, some at the Roche lobe and the stream, and some from the disc. Those of H also show strong bright spot emission but less or no emission from the stream. Disc emission is diminished in H when compared to other emission lines, especially at higher velocities. This is more obvious in the BPM tomogram. The bright spot emission falls near the re gion 100, 350 km s 1. Average subtracted trailed spectra Fig ure 4 show the corresponding NSC. 1 10 11ergs cm 2 s 1 60 70 of the original line fluxes is contained in the average subtracted profiles of H and H , and 1 10 12ergs cm 2 s 1 80 90 is contained in H and HeI 4471. This flux is mainly due to the bright spot and the stream. The trailed spectra have been repeated over 2 cycles for clarity. The trailed spectra of 2001 have revealed two interesting fea tures. The first one is the asymmetry in the intensity of the s wave Figure 4 . In H , the red wing of the NSC is brighter at 98 0.1 0.3 and seems to reach maximum brightness near 98 0.25, whereas the blue wing is dimmer in the range 98 0.7 0.9 and seems to reach minimum brightness near 98 0.75. A similar ef fect is seen in the H and the H lines, and to a lesser extent in HeI 4471. The second feature is redshifted emission extending from the NSC to high velocities 1000 km s 1 at early binary phases 98 0.0 0.2 . c 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000 000 4 N. Mhlahlo, D.A.H. Buckley, V.S. Dhillon, S.B. Potter, B. Warner and P.A. Woudt Figure 3. The panels show the H , H , H and HeI 4471 orbital Doppler maps from 2001, and H tomograms of 1991, constructed using the Back Projection Method with the application of a filter top panels and after subtracting the average of the line profile bottom panels. The orbital maps have been Doppler shifted into the rest frame of the companion, whereas the tomograms are in the rest frame of the white dwarf. Orbital Doppler maps are derived from integrated line profiles whilst tomograms are derived from unblended line profiles. Note that the tomograms for H , H and H are shown in different columns for clarity.

Chunk: . The emission near the edge c 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000 000 6 N. Mhlahlo, D.A.H. Buckley, V.S. Dhillon, S.B. Potter, B. Warner and P.A. Woudt Figure 7. The H , H , H and HeI 4471 trailed spectra from 2001 folded on the spin period are shown at the top panels and the average subtracted spectra are shown at the second panels. Doppler maps constructed from the phase invariant subtracted spectra are shown in the bottom panels. The Doppler maps were constructed using the BPM and are shown on the same velocity scale with the trailed spectra. The lookup table is as in Figure 3. of the tomogram at 500 km s 1 shows maximum blueshift at 67 1.0 and therefore cannot be due to motion perpendicular to the line of sight either. The H trailed spectra also show emission coupled to the spin wave near 67 0.1 0.6 that extends to high velocities in the red, a similar situation to that seen the in orbital tomograms due to the HVC Section 4.1 . The corresponding emission in the H tomograms extending to higher velocities in the red spectral region is not clear. Both the H and H phase invariant subtracted trailed spectra show three weak intensity spin waves. The most clearly visible of the three is phased with maximum redshift near 67 0.3 0.4, with an estimated velocity amplitude of 900 km s 1 and corre sponds to the emission near the 3 o clock position in the tomo gram Figure 8 . The reconstructed trailed spectra reproduce the observed data. The H and H trailed spectra in Figure 7 seem to support these results. The emission observed near the 3 o clock position in the tomograms has also been seen in other IPs such as AO Psc and FO Aqr Hellier 1999 and was interpreted as emanating from the upper accretion curtain. The spin waves are weak in intensity though, and more data are needed to support these results. 6 DISCUSSION OF THE ORBITAL AND SPIN DATA The generally accepted model of EX Hya has the material leaving the secondary star through the L1 point, passing via a stream of material which orbits about the white dwarf, to form an accretion Figure 8. H , H and H trailed spectra of 2001 folded on the spin period are shown in the top panels and the phase invariant subtracted trailed spectra are shown in the second panels from the top. MEM spin Doppler tomograms constructed from the phase invariant subtracted spectra are shown in the third panels with the reconstructed spectra in the bottom panels. The spin wave observed in the H phase invariant subtracted trailed spectra, which was caused by the H narrow component, is shown expanded on a smaller velocity scale. The first column of panels are plotted between 1500 km s 1 and 1500 km s 1 and the last two column are plotted between 2000 km s 1 and 2000 km s 1. The lookup table is as in Figure 4. disc. The magnetic field lines of the white dwarf which form accre tion curtains above and below the orbital plane channel the material from the disc, starting from the co rotation radius Rco where the disc is truncated by the field lines, to the surface of the white dwarf Hellier et al. 1987 Rosen et al. 1991 . King Wynn challenged this model by arguing that systems with Pspin .1 cannot possess Keplerian discs since this implies Rco Rcir. They showed that the spin equilibrium state in EX Hya is determined by Rco b, where b is the distance to the L1 point. In this model the accretion curtains extend to near the L1 point, and EX Hya resembles an asynchronous polar where most of the material accretes via the stream King Wynn 1999 Wynn 2000 .

Queries:
1. What is the nature of the trailed spectra from 2001 folded on the spin period?
2. How is the Doppler Effect manifested in the bottom panels?
3. What was the interpretation of the emission near the 3 o clock position in the tomograms of EX Hya?

Solution:
1. What is the nature of the trailed spectra from 2001 folded on the spin period? 
These trailed spectra are presented in the top panels of the document. They seem to originate from the H , H , H, and HeI 4471, all appearing to be tied to the spin wave near 67 0.1 0.6, extending to high velocities in the red. This pattern is akin to what's observed in orbital tomograms due to the HVC, Section 4.1.
2. How is the Doppler Effect manifested in the bottom panels? 
The Doppler maps, constructed from the phase-invariant subtracted spectra, show the effect of the Doppler Effect in the bottom panels. These maps are visual representations of the velocity shifts in the spectra, and they are shown on

Chunk: provide us with a solution for how to count the number of zero modes in a multimonopole configuration with a non maximally broken gauge group, where the index can not be reliable computed due to a contribution from the continuum portion of the spectrum. What we hope though, is that our regulatization can be useful when attacking our new index problem associated with the moduli space of self dual strings. In section 2 we obtain the index in one and three dimensions. In three dimensions we apply this on the multimonopole moduli space and re derive the result in . A recent review article on monopoles and supersymmetry is . The one and three dimensional index problems have also been studied in . We then indicate how our method manages to reproduce the correct results in any odd dimensions. In section 3 we show how one at least in principle should be able to compute the dimension of the moduli space of N self dual strings by computing a certain index. 2 Computing the Callias index in odd dimensional spaces For Dirac operators on open n 1 dimensional space where n 1 is odd, there is an index theorem by Callias . This applies to Dirac equations of the form D 0 where the Dirac operator D is of the form iiDi n . Here , ..., n 1 and i, n denote the Dirac gamma matrices, 2 . We define the gauge covariant derivative as . If n 1 is odd, the gamma matrices can be represented as 0 i i 0 , 0 i i 0 One may use the n dimesional notation A Ai, , iD , but one must then remember that space is really n 1 dimensional. If n 1 is even there is no Weyl representation of the gamma matrices because of the inclusion of the gamma five , and no index theorem of this form exists. We define the gamma five for even n as i n 2 1 n which then is hermitian, and we define the projectors P 1 2 1 . 3 In odd dimensions n 1, the Dirac operator splits into two Weyl operators D P DP D P DP Because P and D are all hermitian, it follows that D is the hermitian conjugate of D. Also, because D is already of an off block diagonal form, it suffices to include just one of the projectors, so we can just as well write this as DP D P Since ker D and ker D ker DD we can express this as2 dim ker D D dim ker DD dim ker D2 . where we have noted that P P . Callias, Weinberg and others used the regulator I M 2 Tr M 2 D2 M 2 to obtain the index as the limit M 2 0. In this Letter we will be slightly more general. We define Ji x, y tr , for any function f and of course D is not dimensionless, so D has to be accom panied by M in a suitable way . Then we notice that W x, y i i xi A x M i i yi A y M where manifestly W x, y . From this, we obtain the following identity i xi yi Ji x, y 2tr tr A y A x In odd dimensions, the second term in the right hand side vanishes as x ap proaches y. This can be seen as being equivalent to the statement that there is no chiral anomaly in odd dimensions by using point splitting and inserting a Wilson line . So we get i iJi x, x 2tr 2To see this that ker D we apply the definition of hermitian conjugate with respect to the inner product , R dx and the property of the norm, to , D D D

Chunk: 2 1, i 1 1, 1 1 2 A where 1,2,3 are the Pauli sigma matrices, 1234. Then the condition for unbroken SUSY is 1 o 0 where . We have found that if ijkl l then half SUSY is unbroken. This equation is the Bogomolnyi equation for self dual strings . We are interested in finding the number of parameters needed to describe solutions of this equation. We can linearize it and get the equation i i 0 for the bosonic zero modes, that we have gathered into a matrix ij Bij . For this to work we must also assume the background gauge condition . Now this linearized equation Eq does not make any reference to the gauge field. So there is no way that we could count the number of parameters of a multi string configuration just using this equation. This should of course not be a surprise. The strings that we have in the Abelian theory are not solutions of the field equations. They have to be inserted by hand, that is we need to insert delta function sources by hand, in the same spirit as for Dirac monopoles. To be able to count the number of zero modes, we must consider some interacting theory which at the classical level has solitonic string solutions. To pass to non Abelian theory we begin by rewriting the Abelian theory in loop space. Loop space consists of parametrized loops C s 7 C s . We introduce the Abelian loop fields A C s C s C s C s C s C s With these definitions, a short computation reveals that A s transforms as a vec tor and s a contra variant vector under diffeomorphisms in loop space induced by diffeomorphisms in space time. One may then extend these transformation properties to any diffeomorphism in loop space. Space time diffeomorphism and reparametrizations of the loops then get unified and are both diffemorphisms in loop space. The only thing to remember is what is kept fixed under the variation. If it is the parameter of the loop, or the loop itself. 12 The field strength becomes F s, C s C s s t In terms of these fields, the Bogomolnyi equation will read4 Fis, ijkl k s lt . We pass to the non Abelian theory by letting these loop fields become non Abelian, in the sense that A s a s where a s are generators of a loop algebra associated to the gauge group . We introduce a covariant derivative D s A s. Local gauge transformations act as A s s, . Given a loop C, we automatically get a tangent vector C s that makes no reference to space time. We can therefore impose the loop space constraints C s A , and also C s s C for some subtle field s C on loop space. As a consequence, we find that A s . These constraints are covariant under diffeomorphisms of space time and reparametriza tions of loops. They are invariant also under local gauge transformations, pro vided that the gauge parameter is subject to the condition C s s 0 which is the condition of reparametrization invariance. With the assumption made that a s are generators of a loop algebra, we find that the constraint can also be written as A s, t 0 A local gauge variation of this constraint is D s , t A s, t, s , t A s, , t A s, t, s , t , t, A s The last term vanishes by the constraint. The first term gives us the constraint Eq that we must impose on the gauge parameter Z ds a s, C a s . 4We denote by is the usual functional derivative with respect to C s . 13 We have now introduced non local non Abelian

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0019v2 math.PR 23 Jun 2007 Approximation for extinction probability of the contact process based on the Gr obner basis Norio Konno Department of Applied Mathematics Yokohama National University Abstract. In this note we give a new method for getting a series of approxi mations for the extinction probability of the one dimensional contact process by using the Gr obner basis. 1 Introduction Let , where Zd is the d dimensional integer lattices. The contact process is an X valued continuous time Markov process. The model was introduced by Harris in 1974 and is considered as a simple model for the spread of a disease with the infection rate . In this setting, an individual at x Zd for a configuration X is infected if x 1 and healthy if x 0. The formal generator is given by f X x Zd c x, f x f , where x X is defined by x y y y x , and x x 1 x . Here for each x Zd and X, the transition rate is c x, 1 x X y y x 1 y x , 1 with x x1 xd . In particular, the one dimensional contact process is 001 011 at rate , 100 110 at rate , 101 111 at rate 2 , 1 0 at rate 1. Let , where A is the number of elements in A. Let A t Zd denote the state at time t of the contact process with A . There is a one to one correspondence between A t Zd and t X such that x A t if and only if t x 1. For any A Y , we define the extinction probability of A by limt P A . Define A x 0 for any x A , where is an invariant measure of the process starting from a configuration x 1 x Zd and is called the upper invariant measure. In other words, let 1S t denote the probability measure at time t for initial probability measure i which is the pointmass i , 1 . Then limt 1S t . Then self duality of the process implies that A limt P A . The correlation identities for A can be obtained as follows Theorem 1.1 For any A Y , X x A X y y x 1 h A A i X x A h A A . From now on we consider the one dimensional case. We introduce the fol lowing notation , , , . . . . By Theorem 1.1, we obtain Corollary 1.2 2 2 1 , 1 0, 2 2 3 2 0, 2 1 0. 2 The detailed discussion concerning results in this section can be seen in Konno . If we regard , , , , . . . as variables, then the left hand sides of the correlation identities by Theorem 1.1 are polyno mials of degree at most two. In the next section, we give a new procedure for getting a series of approximations for extinction probabilities based on the Gr obner basis by using Corollary 1.2. As for the Gr obner basis, see , for example. 2 Our results Put , , , , , . Let denote the lexicographic order with x y w z u s.

Chunk: means that the invariant measure is 0. From this, we obtain the first approximation of the density of the particle, E x , as follows 1 2 1 2 , for any 1 2. This result gives the first lower bound c of the critical value c of the one dimensional contact process, that is, c. However it should be noted that the inequality is not proved in our approach. The estimated value of c is about 1.649. 3 2.2 Second approximation Consider the following ideal based on Corollary 1.2 and , x, y, z . Here xz y2 corresponds to the second or pair approximation 2.

These results coincide with results given by the Harris lemma more precisely, the Katori Konno method, see or the BFKL inequality see also . As we saw, the generators of Im in Section 2 have degree at most two in x1, x2, . . ., such as 2 y 2 x x 1, ys z2 in the case of I3. We expect that this property will lead to get the higher order approximations of the process and other interacting particle systems having a similar property effectively. Acknowledgment.

These values contain the information needed to transform the measured distribution into the unfolded spectrum, along with statistical uncertainties from fluc tuations. Not all SV are relevant non significant values have zero mean and standard deviation equal to unity . Using toy simulations, we find that seven SV have to be kept with events distributed over ten bins.

V. RESULTS ON THE Q2 DEPENDENCE OF THE HADRONIC FORM FACTOR The unfolded q2 distribution, normalized to unity, is presented in Fig. 7 and in Table II. Also given in this table are the statistical and total uncertainties and the correlations of the data in the ten bins. Figure 7 shows the result of fits to the data for two parameterizations of the form factor with a single free parameter, the simple pole and the modified pole ansatz. Both fitted distribu tions agree well with the data. A summary of these and other form factor parame terizations is given in Table III. These results will be discussed in detail in Section V B. The fit to a model is done by comparing the number of events measured in a given bin of q2 with the expecta tion from the exact analytic integration of the expression pK q2 3 f q2 2 over the bin range, with the overall normalization left free.

We study the origin and size of various systematic effects, correct the MC sim ulation, if possible, assess the impact of the uncertainty of the size of correction on the fit results, and adopt the observed change as a contribution to the systematic un certainty on the fitted parameters for the different param eterizations under study. Some of these studies make use of standard BABAR evaluations of detection efficiencies, others rely on special data control samples, for instance hadronic decays D0 K or K 0. 1. c quark hadronization tuning The signal selection is based on variables related to c quark fragmentation and decay properties of signal events. Simulated events have been weighted to agree with the distributions observed in data. Weights have been obtained using events with a reconstructed D0 de caying into K . After applying these corrections, the distribution of the Fisher discriminant that separates signal and background has been found to be consistent with that of the data. The shape of the fit result after the correction has improved and the fitted value of the signal fraction is consistent with the one expected from the simulation. The impact of the correction on the fit results is also evaluated for various systematic uncertainties, including the variation of the detection efficiency, the use of different parametrizations, and the variation of the value of the parameter corresponding to the relative normalization of the K decay amplitudes. The study concludes that this correction indeed improves the quality of the fits and the evaluation of the systematic un cer tainties on the fitted parameters is self-consistent. In our previous fits we have not applied a correction for the c quark hadronization. In this paper we present new results for the fit parameters obtained with the modified simulation, and compare the results with those of previous fits. This paper also reports on a preliminary attempt to use BABAR data to extract the isospin amplitudes from the decay channel.

Chunk: matrices corresponding, respectively, to statistical and systematic uncertainties. B. Comparison with expectations and with other measurements The summary of the fits to the normalized q2 distri butions are presented in Table III. As long as we allow the form factor parameters to be free in the fit, the fit ted distributions agree well with the data and it is not possible to reject any of the parameterizations. However, if the form factor parameters are constrained to specific predicted values, the agreement is not good. For the ISGW2 model, the predicted dependence of the form factor on q2 disagrees with the data and the fit ted value of the parameter I differs from the predicted value, .104 GeV 2 by more than a factor two. As observed by previous experiments, the simple pole model ansatz, with 2.112 GeV c2 does not reproduce the measurements. This means that the contribution from the continuum DK interaction can not be neglected. If one introduces a second parame ter pole to account for contributions from an effective pole at higher mass see Eq. 10 the two parameters are fully correlated and there is no unique solution, as illus trated in Fig. 8. The modified pole ansatz corresponds to . In Table VI the fitted parameters for the simple pole ansatz and the modified pole ansatz are compared for different experiments. The fitted pole masses are all well below the mass of the D s meson. The results pre sented here are consistent within the stated uncertainties with earlier measurements. Except for the BELLE mea surement, all other measurements appear to favor a value of pole that is lower than the value predicted by lattice QCD, namely .50 0.04.

The third line corresponds to the ratios of measured numbers of signal events in data and in simulation, and the last line gives the ratios of the efficiencies to data and simulation. A. Selection of candidate signal events The selection of D0 K e e candidates is explained in section IV A. For the rate measurement, the con straint on the D mass is not applied and also the momentum of the soft pion candidate is not included in the Fisher discriminant variable designed to suppress B B background. Since generic simulated signal events used in this measurement have been generated with the ISGW2 model, they have been weighted so that their q2 distribution agrees with the measurement presented in this paper. Furthermore, we require for the Fisher dis criminant FB m 0.16 GeV c2. After background subtraction, there remain 76283 323 and 95302 309 events in data and simulation, respec tively. This gives N D0 K e e data N D0 K e e .8004 0.0043. To select D0 K candidates, the same data sam ples are used and particles, in each event, are selected in the same way.

Chunk: necessary to improve the precision on the determination of Vcb and Vub . In D0 K e e decays , with a pseudoscalar hadron emitted in the final state, and neglecting the elec tron mass, the differential decay rate depends only on one form factor f q2 , d 3 Vcs 2 pK q2 3 f q2 2 , where GF is the Fermi constant, q2 is the invariant mass squared of the two leptons, e and e, and pK q2 is the kaon three momentum in the D0 rest frame . In this paper we present measurements of the q2 variation and absolute value of the hadronic form factor at K e e . The data consist of D mesons produced in e e c c continuum events at a center of mass energy near the 4S mass, and were recorded by the BABAR detector at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center s PEP II collider. A semi inclusive reconstruction technique is used to select charm semilep tonic decays with high efficiency. As a result of this ap proach, events with a photon radiated during the D0 de cay are included in the signal. The systematic uncertain ties are kept as low as possible by using control samples extracted from data where possible. Measurements of D K l l, based on smaller signal events samples, have been published by the CLEO , FOCUS and Belle collaborations. This paper is organized as follows. A general descrip tion of the hadronic form factor, f q2 , is given in Sec tion II, where the different parameterizations considered Italy Also with Universit a della Basilicata, Potenza, Italy Also with IPPP, Physics Department, Durham University, Durham DH1 3LE, United Kingdom in this analysis are explained. In Section III a short de scription of the detector components that are important to this measurement is given. The selection of signal events and the rejection of background are considered in Section IV. In Section V, the measured q2 variation of the hadronic form factor is discussed and compared with previous measurements. In Section VI the measured de cay rate is given and in Section VII these measurements are combined to obtain the value of f . II. THE F Q2 HADRONIC FORM FACTOR The amplitude for the decay D0 K l ldepends on two hadronic form factors K p V D p p p q m2 D m2 K q2 f q2 m2 D m2 K q2 q f0 q2 where V s c. The constraint f f0 en sures that there is no singularity at . When the charged lepton is an electron, the contribution from f0 is proportional to m2 e and can be neglected in decay rate measurements. The parameterizations of f q2 which have been com pared with present measurements and a few examples of theoretical approaches, proposed to determine the val ues of corresponding parameters, are considered in the following. A. Form factor parameterizations The most general expressions of the form factor f q2 are analytic functions satisfying the dispersion relation f q2 Res f Z t dt If t t q2 io . The only singularities in the complex t q2 plane orig inate from the interaction of the charm and the strange quarks in vector states. They are a pole, situated at the D s mass squared and a cut, along the positive real axis, starting at threshold t mD mK 2 for D0K pro duction. 1. Taylor expansion This cut t plane can be mapped onto the open unit disk with center at z t, t0 t t t t0 t t t t0 . In this variable, the physical region for the semileptonic decay mD mK 2 corresponds to 7 a real segment extending between 0.051. This value of zmax is obtained for 1 p 1 t t . The z expansion of f is thus expected to

Chunk: and simulated events. MC events have been normalized to the sample luminosity according to the different cross sections. An excess of background events of the order of 5 is observed for large values of m . The arrow indicates the additional selection applied for the q2 distribution measurement. B. Background rejection Background events arise from 4S decays and hadronic events from the continuum. Three variables are used to reduce the contribution from B B events R2 the ratio between the second and zeroth order Fox Wolfram moments , the total charged and neutral multiplicity and the momentum of the soft pion s from the D . These variables exploit the topological differ ences between events with B decays and events with c c fragmentation. The particle distribution in 4S decay events tends to be isotropic as the B mesons are pro duced near threshold, while the distribution in c c events is jet like as the c.m. energy is well above the charm threshold. This also results in a softer D momentum spectrum in 4S decays compared to c c events. Corresponding distributions of these variables for sig nal and background events are given in Fig. 2. These variables have been combined linearly in a Fisher dis criminant.

Background events from the continuum arise mainly from charm particles as requiring an electron and a kaon reduces the contribution from light quark flavors to a low level. Because charm hadrons take a large fraction of the charm quark energy charm decay products have higher average energies and different angular distributions rel ative to the thrust axis or to the D direction compared with other particles in the hemisphere emitted from the hadronization of the c and c quarks.

Chunk: row shows mean field simulations with . a .3, 95 c, b .14, 260 c, c .22, 600 c, and d .16, 300 c. Other parameters as in Fig. 3 the system size shown is . stochastic simulations with parameter values correspond ing to the respective mean field simulations. To compare mean field simulations with different enzyme densities, the following property of equations can be used in troducing relative concentrations , m c, it can be noticed that they obey the same equations, but with a rescaled coefficient e c. Thus, essentially the same patterns are observed as long as the parameter combination c remains constant. In the stochastic simulations in Fig. 4, the coefficient has been increased to compensate for a decrease in the enzyme concentration. For larger enzyme concentrations, good agreement between mean field predictions and stochas tic simulations has been found. In the mean field equa tions , intramolecular fluctuations are not taken into account 0 and therefore each turnover cycle has the same fixed duration . Stochastic simulations have been, however, also performed when such fluctuations were present. Synchronization waves could still be found even at internal noise levels which corresponded to the mean relative dispersion of turnover times of about 10 with 2 1 2 2 1 2 . Although the emphasis in this Letter is on the phenom ena in two dimensional enzymic arrays, analogous effects should be expected for three dimensional systems repre senting aqueous enzymic solutions. The linear stability analysis, yielding Hopf and wave bifurcation boundaries see Fig. 3 , is valid also for the 3D geometry. We have performed preliminary stochastic simulations for thin so lution layers with high enzyme concentrations and could 4 observe synchronization patterns similar to those found for the enzymic arrays. A product molecule, released by an enzyme, diffuses in the solution until it either binds, as a regulatory molecule, to another enzyme or undergoes a decay. Here, it should be taken into account that a regulatory molecule can bind to an allosteric enzyme only at a certain bind ing site of characteristic radius R. Using the theory of diffusion controlled reactions, the average time ttransit after which a regulatory product would find a binding site of one of the enzymes can be roughly estimated as , if enzymes are uniformly dis tributed inside the reaction volume with concentration c. Therefore, binding typically occurs within the dis tance Dttransit 1 cR 1 2 from the point where a molecule is released. Obviously, it can only take place if the product molecule has not undergone decay until that moment, i.e. if . This condition puts a restriction on the enzyme concentration c, which must be higher than the critical concentration DR. Choosing 103 s 1, 10 7 cm, the critical enzyme concentration is 10 6 M. A similar estimate can be obtained when enzymes are immobilized on a plane im mersed into a reactive solution in this case the mean dis tance between the enzymes on the plane should be less than Rldiff 1 2 . Although the required en zyme concentrations are relatively large, they are within the range characteristic for biological cells glycolytic en zymes are present in a cell at even higher concentra tion of more than 10 5 M . The characteristic temporal period of developing patterns is determined by the en zyme turnover time , which typically varies from mil liseconds to seconds. The characteristic length scale of developing wave patterns is determined by the diffusion length ldiff, which can vary under these conditions from a fraction of a micrometer to tens of micrometers. Our analysis shows that spontaneous molecular syn chronization of allosteric product activated enzymes can be observed in enzymic arrays. Artificial arrays formed by immobilized protein machines molecular motors are already used in experiments on active nanoscale trans port see . Many enzymes in biological cells are membrane bound, thus

Chunk: chordal areas of the driving path process. Note however that the L2 norm of the 2 variation of a Wiener process is finite. In the Lie group integration procedure prescribed above we must solve a stochastic differential system on the Lie algebra g defined by the set of governing vector fields v i and the driving path process w W 1, . . . , W d . In light of the Universal Limit Theorem and with stepsize adaptivity in mind in future see Gaines and Lyons , we for instance use in our examples order 1 stochastic numerical methods that include the L evy chordal area to solve for the flow on the Lie algebra g. We have thus explained the idea behind Munthe Kaas methods and how they can be generalized to the stochastic setting. The first half of this paper formalizes this procedure. In the second half of this paper, we consider autonomous vector fields and con struct stochastic Lie group integration schemes using Castell Gaines methods. This approach proceeds as follows. We truncate the stochastic exponential Lie series expan sion corresponding to the flow t of the solution process y to the stochastic differential equation . We then approximate the driving path process w W 1, . . . , W d by replacing it by a suitable nearby piecewise smooth path in the appropriate variation topology. An approximation to the solution yt requires the exponentiation of the approximate truncated exponential Lie series. This can be achieved by solving the system of ordinary differential equations driven by the vector field that is the approx imate truncated exponential Lie series. If we use ordinary Munthe Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary differential integrator the Castell Gaines method becomes a stochastic Lie group integrator. Further, based on the Castell Gaines approach we then present uniformly accurate exponential Lie series integrators that are globally more accurate than their stochastic Taylor counterpart schemes these are investigated in detail in Lord, Malham and Wiese for linear stochastic differential equations . They require the assumption that a sufficiently accurate underlying ordinary differential integrator is used that integrator could for example be an ordinary Lie group Munthe Kaas method. In the case of two driving Wiener processes we derive the order 1 2, and in the case of one driving Wiener process the order 1 uniformly accurate exponential Lie series integrators. As a consequence we confirm the asymptotic efficiency properties for both these schemes proved by Castell and Gaines see Newton for more details on the concept of asymptotic efficiency . We also present in the case of one driving Wiener process a new order 3 2 uniformly accurate exponential Lie series integrator also see Lord, Malham and Wiese . We present two physical applications that demonstrate the advantage of using stochastic Munthe Kaas methods. First we consider a free rigid body which for ex ample could model the dynamics of a satellite. We suppose that it is perturbed by two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes. The governing vector fields are non commutative and the corresponding exact stochastic flow evolves on the unit sphere. We show that the stochastic Munthe Kaas method, with an order 1 stochastic Taylor integrator used to progress along the corresponding Lie algebra, preserves the 4 Malham and Wiese approximate solution in the unit sphere manifold to within machine error. However when an order 1 stochastic Taylor integrator is used directly, the solution leaves the unit sphere. The contrast between these two methods is more emphatically demon strated in our second application. Here we consider an autonomous underwater vehicle that is also perturbed by two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes. The exact stochastic flow evolves on the manifold which is the dual of the Euclidean Lie algebra se two independent Casimirs are conserved by the exact flow. Again the stochastic Munthe Kass method preserves the Casimirs to within machine

Chunk: heights of the emitted radiation. In general the amplitudes of the oscillations compared to the radiation temperature are large, in this sense mm wavelength radiation combines the advantages of the CO lines, which mainly see the cool gas, with those of atomic lines and UV continua, which mainly sample the hot gas. On the whole, the brightness temperatures are ex tremely time dependent at millimeter wavelengths, fol lowing changes in the atmospheric parameters. With increasing wavelength the amplitude of the brightness oscillations grows significantly, reaches its maximum value at 2.2 mm expected to be 15 of the quiet Sun brightness temperature , and decreases rapidly towards longer wavelengths. Thus we can identify the range 0.8 5.0 mm as the appropriate range of mm wavelengths at which one can expect the clearest signatures of dynamic effects. A careful look at the mm brightness spectrum as a function of time see Fig. 2 reveals a time delay between the oscillations at long and short millimeter wavelengths. Hence, it is possible to study wave modes traveling in the chromosphere by comparing sub mm with mm observations. 3 Discussion The CS model predicts that spatially and temporally resolved observations should clearly exhibit the signa tures of the strong shock waves. However, a direct com parison of the observational data products RMS val ues, histogram skewness, Fourier and wavelet spectra, etc. , referring to regions with weak magnetic field like the quiet Sun internetwork, with the corresponding prod ucts expected from the simulations of Carlsson Stein exhibits large differences. In particular, the RMS of the brightness temperature is nearly an order of magnitude larger in the model 800 K at 3 mm than in the ob servations 100 K . Another difference is the absence of longer periods in the model power spectrum. But these discrepancies do not rule out the CS models. On the one hand the model is one dimensional and hence does not predict a coherence length of the oscillations, while on the other hand we are not able to resolve individual oscillating elements due to the limited spatial resolution of the observations. Consequently we estimated the influence of the spa tial smearing on the model parameters of chromospheric dynamics and on the observed oscillatory power. Thus we confirmed that the very limited spatial resolution currently available hinders a clean separation between cells and network and typically both network and in ternetwork areas contribute to the recorded BIMA ra 4 diation. From the analysis of the observational data it was found that power in all frequency ranges increases significantly with improving resolution. Consistency be tween the power predicted by the CS model and the observed power is obtained if the coherence length of oscillating elements is on the order of 1 . Our results are consistent with Wedemeyer et al. , who computed the millimeter wave signature re sulting from the 3 D simulations of Wedemeyer et al. . Although the 3 D simulations suffer from the fact that the radiative transfer of energy is computed en tirely in LTE, which becomes a poor assumption at chromospheric heights, the authors believe that the chro mospheric pattern and its temporal evolution is repre sentative of the non magnetic internetwork regions of the solar chromosphere. The simulations display a com plex 3D structure of the chromospheric layers, which is highly dynamical on temporal scales of 20 25 s and on spatial scales comparable to solar granulation, which is in good agreement with the 1 size of oscillating ele ments that we deduced. According to Wedemeyer et al. the chromospheric temperature structure is charac terized by a pattern of hot shock waves, which originate from convective motions, and cool gas lying between the shocks. The intensity distribution at mm wavelengths follows the pattern of the shocks in the chromosphere with a sub arcsecond size of the features associated with the shocks. All this complex and

Chunk: the soliton amplitude level. If there is a damping of the pumped wave, even modes will never reach an amplitude comparable with that of the lowest mode. As a result they can contribute to the nonlinear waveform profile only, if the amplitude of the initial waveform is far beyond the threshold of soliton formation. Interaction of modes of the same type of symmetry are described by a parametric term as well as by an additional pseudo linear tri linear exci tation term, playing the role of an external source of excitation. Such a pseudo linear excitation is a threshold free process. In contrast to paramet ric processes it does not need an initial amplitude value to start the the process. The pseudo linear excitation is possible only due to the effective dipolar pinning of the magnetization at the stripe edges. If the edge spins were unpinned, the interaction of all the width modes would be purely para metric. The purely parametric mechanism of developing a transversal instability is typical for the process of bullet formation from a plane wave waveform in an unconfined medium, which distinguishes it from the process of soliton and bullet formation in the waveguide structures. In contrast, the transverse instability of a wave packet in a confined medium starts as a pseudolinear excitation of higher order width modes. This mechanism ensures a rapid growth of the symmetric . After that the main mode together with the . Our theory shows that the efficiency of both nonlinear interaction mech anisms parametric and tri linear strongly depends on the group velocity difference of modes and the initial length of the nonlinear pulse. In larger stripes the group velocities of modes are closer to each other. As a result the nonlinearly generated higher order modes longer remain within the pump pulse. If the pulse is long enough, they reach significant amplitudes and a bullet like waveform is formed. In narrower stripes the group velocity differ ence is larger, and consequently the nonlinearly generated highorder wave forms leave faster the pumping area. As a result, for the same pulse length, they do not reach significant amplitudes. The nonlinear steepening results 5 Figure 2 Lateral shapes of the nonlinear SW packets. 1 and 2 theoretical results calculated for the ferrite stripes of width of 2.5mm and 1mm , respec tively. 3 and 4 experimental profiles observed in YIG waveguides of width of 2.5mm and 1mm, respectively. 1 and 3 bullets. 2 and 4 solitons. in the transformation of the lowest mode into a soliton.

In the inset, the weights of FC and adiabatically connected transitions are shown as a function of for 1.3. However, a dramatic change of OC occurs around critical coupling strength c 8.5. The dominating peak of OC splits into two ones, the energy of lover one corresponding to the predictions of SCR expansion and that of upper one obeying extended MFF value Fig. 5a . The shoulder, corresponding to dynamical extended MFF contribution, rapidly decreases it s intensity with increase of and at large Fig. 5b c the OC is in good agreement with strong coupling expansion, assuming FC scheme. Finally, comparing energies of the peaks, obtained by DMC, extended MFF and FC strong coupling ex pansion Fig. 5d , we conclude that at critical coupling c 8.5 the spectral properties rapidly switch from dynamic, when lattice relaxes at transition, to FC regime, where nuclei are frozen in initial configuration. In order get an idea of the FC breakdown authors of consider the fol lowing arguments. The approximate adiabatic states are not exact eigenstates of the system. These states are mixed by nondiagonal matrix elements of the Spectroscopic Properties of Polarons by Exact Monte Carlo 19 nonadiabatic operator D and exact eigenstates are linear combinations of the adiabatic wavefunctions. Being interested in the properties of transition from ground g to an excited ex state, whose energy correspond to that of the OC peak, it is necessary to consider mixing of only these states and express exact wavefunctions as a linear combinations of ground and excited adi abatic states. The coefficients of superposition are determined from standard techniques where nondiagonal matrix elements of the nonadiabatic operator are expressed in terms of matrix elements of the kinetic energy operator M, the gap between excited and ground state of phonons in adiabatic state D M E 1q n 1 2 1 2 M 2 E 2. The extent to which lattice can follow transition between electronic states, depends on the degree of mixing between initial and final exact eigenstates through the nonadiabatic interaction. If initial and ground states are strongly mixed, the adiabatic classification has no sense and, therefore, the FC pro cesses have no place and lattice is adjusted to the transition. The other extreme corresponds to the situation when the initial and ground states do not mix at all, and the adiabatic picture appears to be most appropriate.

Chunk: derivatives at the right and left ends being fixed by the Wannier limit and perturbation theory, respectively. Inset in panel a the initial part of the plot. Panel b the wave function of internal motion in real space for the optically forbidden monopolar exciton. Panels c e the wave function of internal motion in real space c Wannier 60 d intermediate 10 e near Frenkel 0.4 regimes. The solid line in the panel c is the Wannier model result while solid lines in other panels are to guide the eyes only. To study conditions of validity of limiting regimes by DMC method, electron hole spectrum of three dimensional system was chosen in the form of symmetric valence and conduction bands with width Ec and direct gap Eg Spectroscopic Properties of Polarons by Exact Monte Carlo 25 at zero momentum . For large ratio , when , exci ton binding energy is in good agreement with Wannier approximation results Fig. 9a and probability density of relative electron hole motion corresponds Fig. 9c to hydrogen like result. The striking result is the requirement of rather large valence and conduction bandwidths for applicability of Wannier approximation. For smaller values of W the binding energy and wave function of relative motion Fig. 9d deviate from large radius results. In the similar way, conditions of validity of Frenkel approach are rather restricted too. Moreover, even strong localization of wave function does not guarantee good agreement between exact and Frenkel approximation result for binding energy. At 10 the wave function is already strongly localized though binding energy considerably differs from Frenkel approximation result. For example, at .4 relative motion is well localized Fig. 9e whereas the binding energy of Frenkel approximation is two times larger than exact result Inset in Fig. 9a . A study of conditions necessary for formation of charge transfer exciton in three dimensional systems is crucial to finalize protracted discussion of numer ous models concerning properties of mixed valence semiconductors . A decade ago unusual properties of SmS and SmB6 were explained by invoking the excitonic instability mechanism assuming charge transfer nature of the optically forbidden exciton . Although this model explained quanti tatively the phonon spectra , optical properties , and mag netic neutron scattering data , it s basic assumption has been criticized as being groundless . To study excitonic wavefunction, dispersions of valence and conduction bands were chosen as it is typical for mixed valence materials almost flat valence band is separated from broad conduction band, having maximum in the centre and minimum at the border of Brillouin zone . Results presented in Fig. 9b support assumption of since wave function of relative motion has almost zero on site component and maximal charge density at near neighbors. 6 Polarons in Undoped High Temperature Superconductors It is now well established that the physics of high temperature superconduc tors is that of hole doping a Mott insulator . Even a single hole in a Mott insulator, i.e. a hole in an antiferromagnet in case of infinite Hubbard repulsion U, is substantially influenced by many body effects be cause it s jump to a neighboring site disturbs antiferromagnetic arrangement of spins. Hence a thorough understanding of the dynamics of doped holes in Mott insulators has attracted a great deal of recent interest. The two major interactions relevant to the electrons in solids are electron electron interac tions EEI and electron phonon interactions EPI . The importance of the former at low doping is no doubt essential since the Mott insulator is driven 26 A. S. Mishchenko and N. Nagaosa by strong Hubbard repulsion, while the latter was considered to be largely irrelevant to superconductivity based on the observations of a small isotope effect on the optimal Tc and an absence of a phonon contribution to the resistivity for review see .

Chunk: in high temperature semiconductors and mixed valent materials . One of possible reasons for these broadenings is the interaction of the QPs with the lattice degrees of freedom. However, in many realistic cases other subsystems, not explicitly included into the polaron Hamiltonian, are responsible for the decay of QP and phonons, e.g., another electronic bands, phonon anharmonic ity, interaction with nuclear spins, etc. Then, if this auxiliary broadening is known in some approximation, one can formulate an ambitious goal to study spectral response when bare quasiparticle with known damping interacts with broadened bosonic excitations. No one of traditional numerical methods, to say nothing of analytical ones, can give approximation free results for measurable quantities of polaron, such as optical conductivity or angle resolved photoemission spectra, for in macro scopic system of arbitrary dimension. Besides, we are not aware of any numer ical method which can incorporate in an approximation free way the informa tion on the damping of QP and bosonic bath. Below we describe basics of re cently developed Diagrammatic Monte Carlo DMC method for numerically exact computation of Green functions and correlation functions in imaginary time for few polarons in a macroscopic system . Analytic continuation of imaginary time functions to real frequencies is per Spectroscopic Properties of Polarons by Exact Monte Carlo 3 formed by a novel approximation free approach of stochastic optimization SO , circumventing difficulties of popular Maximal Enthropy method. Finally we focus on results of application of the DMC SO machinery to various problems The basic models, related to the polaronic objects in correlated systems, which can be solved by DMC SO methods, are stated in the next Sect. It is followed in Sect. 1.2 by description of stumbling blocks encountered by analytic methods. Sect. 2 concerns the basics of DMC SO methods. However, those who are not interested in the details of the methods can briefly look through the definitions in the introduction for Sect. 2 and turn to Sect. 3 where LF and optical conductivity of Fr ohlich polaron are discussed see also . Results of studies of the self trapping phenomenon are presented in Sect. 4 and application of DMC SO methods to the exciton problem can be found in Sect. 5. The chapter is completed by Sect. 6 devoted to studies of ARPES of high temperature superconductors. 1.1 Formulation of a General Model with Interacting Polarons In general terms, the simplest problem of a complex polaronic object, where center of mass motion does not separate from the rest of degrees of freedom, is introduced as system of two QPs Hpar a k a kak X k h k hkh k ak and hk are annihilation operators, and a k and h k are dispersions of QPs , which interact with each other Ha U p, k, k a p kh p khp k ap k .

Chunk: and relaxed excited state potential D Q 2 2 2 2 dotted line . model, giving the adiabatic ratio . Besides, as experience with the OC of the Fr ohlich polaron Sect. 3.2 shows, there is one more important parameter in the strong coupling limit. Namely, the ratio between measurement process time h E where E is the energy separation of shake offhump from the ground state pole, and that of characteristic lattice time 1 0 is much less than unity. Hence, fast photoemission probe sees the ions frozen in one of possible configurations . The LF in the FC limit is a sum of transitions between a lower Elow Q and an upper Eup Q sheets of adiabatic potential, weighted by the adiabatic wave function of the lower sheet low Q 2 . If EPI is absent both in initial Elow Q Q2 2 and final Eup Q D Q2 2 states, the LF is peaked at the energy D. Then, if there is EPI Eup Q Q only in the final state, i.e. when hole is removed from the Mott insulator, the upper sheet of adiabatic potential Eup Q D 2 2 Q 2 2 has the same energy D at . Since the probability function low Q 2 has maximum at , the peak of the LF broadens but it s energy does not shift Fig. 11g . Spectroscopic Properties of Polarons by Exact Monte Carlo 31 Behavior of the LF is the same as observed in the ARPES of undoped cuprates. The LF consists of a broad peak and a high energy incoherent con tinuum see Fig. 11a . Besides, dispersion of the broad peak c in Figs. 11 reproduces that of sharp peak in pure t J model Fig. 11b f . The lowest dis persionless peak, corresponding to small radius polaron, has very small weight and, hence, can not be seen in experiment. On the other hand, according to ex periment, momentum dependence of spectral weight Z k of broad resonance exactly reproduces dispersion of Z k factor of pure t J model. The reason for such perfect mapping is that in adiabatic case 0 2J 1 all weight of the sharp resonance in t J model without EPI is transformed at strong EPI into the broad peak. This picture implies that the chemical potential in the heavily underdoped cuprates is not connected with the broad resonance but pinned to the real quasiparticle pole with small Z factor. This conclusion was recently confirmed experimentally . Comparing the critical EPI for a hole in the t J Holstein model 40 42 c t J 0.38 and that for Holstein model c H 1.2 with the same value of hopping t, we conclude that spin hole interaction accelerates transition into the strong coupling regime. The reason for enhancement of the role of EPI is found in . Comparison of the EPI driven renormalization of the effective mass in t J Holstein and Holstein model shows that large effective mass in the t J model is responsible for this effect. The enhancement of the role of EPI by EEI takes place at least for a single hole at the bottom of the t J band. Had the comparison been made with half filled model, the result would have been smaller enhancement or no enhancement at all . On the other hand, coupling constant of half breathing phonon is increased by correlations . Finally, we conclude that effect of enhancement of the effective EPI by EEI is not unambiguous and depends on details of interaction and filling. However, this effect is present for small filling in the t J Holstein model. 6.2 Isotope Effect on ARPES in Underdoped High Temperature Superconductors The magnetic resonance mode and the phonon modes are the two major candidates to explain the kink structure of the electron energy dispersion around 40 70 meV

Chunk: gle hole is anomalously enhanced in the intermediate coupling regime while can be described by the simple independent oscillators model in the strong coupling regime. The shift of FCP top and change of the FCP height are rele vant quantities to pursue experimentally in the intermediate coupling regime since IE on these characteristics is enhanced near the self trapping point. In 8 Results are almost independent on the parameter of the Gaussian distribution G ,l 1 2 exp 4t 0 l 2 2 in the range 0.12, 0.2 . Spectroscopic Properties of Polarons by Exact Monte Carlo 35 contrast, shift of the leading edge of the broad peak is the relevant quantity in the strong coupling regime since this value increases with coupling as . These conclusions, depending on the fact whether self trapping phenomenon is encountered in specific case, can be applied fully or partially to another compounds with strong EPI . 6.3 Conclusions and Perspectives In this article, we have focused mainly on the polaron problem in strongly correlated systems. This offers an approach from the limit of low carrier con centration doped into the Mott insulator, which is complementary to the conventional Eliashberg Migdal approach for the EPI in metals. In the latter case, we have the Fermi energy F as a relevant energy scale, which is usually much larger than the phonon frequency 0. In this case, the adiabatic Migdal approximation is valid and the vertex corrections, which correspond to the multi phonon cloud and are essential to the self trapping phenomenon, are suppressed by the ratio 0 F . Therefore an important issue is the crossover from the strong coupling polaronic picture to the weak coupling Eliashberg Migdal picture. This occurs as one increases the carrier doping into the insu lator. As is observed by ARPES experiments in high temperature supercon ductors, the polaronic states continue to survive even at finite doping . This suggests a novel polaronic metallic state in underdoped cuprates, which is common also in CMR manganites and is most probably universal in transition metal oxides. In the optimal and overdoped region, the Eliashberg Migdal picture becomes appropriate , but still a nontrivial feature of the EPI is its strong momentum dependence leading to the dichotomy between the nodal and anti nodal regions. It is an interesting observation that the high est superconducting transition temperature is attained at the crossover region between the two pictures above, which suggests that both the itinerancy and strong coupling to the phonons are essential to the quantum coherence. It should be noted that this crossover occurs in a nontrivial way also in the mo mentum space, i.e., the nodal and anti nodal regions behave quite differently as discussed in Sect. 6.2. However, the relevance of the EPI to the high Tc superconductivity is still left for future investigations. We hope that this article convinces the readers the vital role of ARPES experiments and numerically exact solutions to the EPI problem, the com bination of them offers a powerful tool for the momentum energy resolved analysis of these rather complicated strongly correlated electronic systems. This will pave a new path to the deeper understanding of the many body electronic systems. We thank Y. Toyozawa, Z. X. Shen, T. Cuk, T. Devereaux, J. Zaanen, S. Ishihara, A. Sakamoto, N. V.

Chunk: Vick theorem expresses matrix element of time ordered operators as a sum of terms, each is a factor of matrix elements of pairs of operators, and expansion becomes an infinite series of integrals with an ever increasing number of integration variables Gk X ,2,4... X m Z dx 1 dx m D m m x 1, . . . , x m . Here index m stands for different Feynman diagrams FDs of the same order m. Term with . Function D m m x 1, . . . , x m of any order m can be expressed as a fac tor of GFs of noninteracting quasiparticle, GFs of phonons, and interaction vortexes V k, q . For the simplest case of Hamiltonian system expressions for GFs of QP G k 2 1 exp o k 2 1 1 and phonons D q 2 1 exp q 2 1 1 are well known. An important feature of the DMC method, which is distinct from the row of other exact numerical approaches, is the explicit possibility to include renormalized GFs into exact expansion without any change of the algorithm. For example, if a damping of QP, caused by some interactions not included in the Hamiltonian, is known, i.e. retarded self energy of QP ret k, is available, renormalized GF eG k 1 Z d e Im ret k, o k Re ret k, 2 Im ret k, 2 can be introduced instead of bare GF G k . Explicit rules for evaluation of D m m do not depend on the order and topology of FD. GFs of noninteracting QPs G k 2 1 or eG k 2 1 with corresponding times and momenta are ascribed to horizontal lines and noninteracting GFs of phonon D q 2 1 multiplied by the factor of corresponding vortexes V k , q V k , q are attributed to phonon propagator arch see Fig. 1a . Then, D m m is the factor of all GSs. For example, expression for the weight of the second order term Fig. 1b is the following 10 A. S. Mishchenko and N.

The DMC process is a numerical procedure which, basing on the Metropo lis principle , samples different FDs in the parameter space , m, m, x m and collects statistics of external variable in a way that the result of this statistics converges to exact GF Gk . Although sampling of the internal parameters of one term in and switch between different orders is per formed within the the framework of one and the same numerical process, it is instructive to start with the procedure of evaluation of a specific term D m m x 1, . . . , x m . Starting from a set x 1, . . . , x m , an update x old l x new l of an arbitrary chosen parameter is suggested. This update is accepted or rejected according to Metropolis principle. After many steps, altering all variables, statistics of external variable converges to exact dependence of the term on . Suggestion for new value of parameter x new S 1 R is generated by random number R with a normalized distribution function W xl in a range x min x max l .

Its name suggests a compressed account of its history for Arthur Cayley simultaneously with, but independently of, John Graves Email address rdemarrais alum.mit.edu 1 jumped on Hamilton s initial generalization of the 2 D Imaginaries to the 4 D Quaternions within weeks of its announcement, producing by the method later streamlined into Leonard Dickson s close to modern cookie cutter procedure the 8 D Octonions. The hope, voiced by no less than Gauss, had been that an infinity of new forms of Number were lurking out there, with wondrous proper ties just awaiting discovery, whose magical utility would more than compensate for the loss of things long taken for granted as their seekers ascended into higher dimensions. But such fantasies were quashed quite abruptly by Adolph Hurwitz s proof, just a few years before the 20th Century loomed, that it only took four dimension doublings past the Real Number Line to find trouble the 16 D Sede nions had zero divisors, which meant division algebra itself broke down, which meant researchers were so at a loss to find anything good to say about such Num bers that nobody bothered to even give their 32 D immediate successors a name, much less investigate them seriously. But it is with these 32 D Pathions for short for pathological, which we ll call them from now on that our own account will pick up in this second part of our study of placeholder substructures i.e., zero divisors For, due to a phenomenon we dubbed carrybit overflow in the first installment, strange yet pre dictable things are found to be afoot in the ZD equivalent of a Cayley Table. As we ll see shortly, this is a listing, in a square array, of the ZD emanations or lack of same of all ZD elements with each other all, that is, sharing mem bership in an ensemble defined not by a shared identity element, but a common strut constant. What we ll see is that the lacks are of the essence for each doubling of N, the Emanation Table ET for the 2N 1 ions of same strut constant will contain that of its predecessor, leading to an infinite boxes within boxes deployment whose empty cells define, as N grows ever larger, an unmistakable fractal limit. The full algorithmic analysis of such Matrioshka doll like meta fractal aspects by the simple rules of what we ll call recipe theory after the R, C, and P values related to the Row label, Column label, and their cell specific Products in such Tables must await our third and last installment. But the colored quilt like graphics can be viewed by any interested readers at their leisure, in the Powerpoint slide show online at Wolfram Science from our mid June presentation at NKS 2006.

Chunk: Add 1, then 2, 0s to the right of each bitstring 1,2,3 1,4,5 1,8,9 Add 1, then 2, 0s just before the rightmost bit in each bitstring 3,4,7 3,8,11 3,16,19 Add 1, then 2, 0s just after the leftmost bit in each bitstring Proof. Rule 1 will create a new unit of index G L from any unit of index , regardless of what power of 2 G might be. Rule 2, meanwhile, uses any power of 2 which exceeds all indices of the trip it would operate on, then adds this G to two of the members of the trip, creating a new trip with reversed orientation one of an infinite series of such, differing only in the power of 2 hence, position of the leftmost bit used to construct them. The lemma, then, is an obvious restatement of the fundamental implications of the CDP Rules. But creation of U indices associated with L indices in Assessor dyads is the direct result of creating new triplets with G S as their middle term. Hence, if we call the current generator g and that of the next higher 2N ions G 2 g , then if Assessors with L indices u and v form DMZs in the Sedenions for a given strut constant S, their U indices will increment by g in the Pathions, and zero division will remain unaffected. By induction, the emanation table contents of the 13 Sedenion R,C,P entries will remain unchanged for all N, for all fixed S 7. This leads us to Theorem 9. All non long diagonal cell entries in all ETs for all N, for all fixed S 7, will be filled. Proof. Keeping the same notation, the 2N ions will have g more Assessors than their predecessors, with indices ranging from g itself to 2g 1 G 1 . Consider first some arbitrary Zigzag Assessor with L index , whose U index is G z S. If it were a Vent Assessor, or a Zigzag on a reversed orientation strut in a Type II box kite, the second part of the expression would be reversed S z, per the First Vizier. This effects triplet orientation, but not absolute value of the index, however, and it is only the latter which matters at the moment. Now consider the Assessor whose L index is the lowest of those new to the 2N ions, g. We know it is a Vent Assessor, in all Box Kites with , of which there are 7 per each such S in the Pathions, 35 in the 64 D 26 ions, and so on for it belongs to the trip S,g,g S Rule 1 , so that its U index appears on its immediate left in the triplet G g S,g,G S Rule 2 and last parentheses . Its U index, then, is G g S , or recall Rule 1 just G g S. We claim these Assessors form DMZs or, writing out the arithmetic, that the following term by term multiplication is true g G g S z G z S G g z S z g z g G g z S 0 Because one Assessor is assumed a Zigzag, while the other is proven a Vent, the inner signs will be the same. Simple sign reversals, akin to those involving our frequently invoked binary variable sg, will let us generalize our proof to include the Vent times Vent case later. Let s examine the terms one at a time, starting with the bottom line. Its left term is an obvious application of Rule 1, as , the latter being the Generator of the prior CDP level which also contained z as an L index. The term on bottom right we derive as follows we know that z and its U index partner in the 2N 1 ions belong to the triplet mediated by g S

Top right f,d,b b g,d g, f b g,G f,G g d Rule 2 twice, , then N 5. Upper dyad s inner sign reverses that of product. A similar brief exercise with either DMZ formed with the emanated Assessor will show it, too, has a negative inner sign with respect to a positive in its DMZ partner. Two negative edge signs in one Sail means Zigzag means three negative edge signs, in fact . Our proof up through the Pathions is complete we need only indicate the existence of a constructive mechanism for pursuing this same strategy as N grows arbitrarily large. Consider now the same PSL 2,7 triangle, but in its center put a 16 , after the 64 Hexagrams of the I Ching, to give them a name . Then, put all 7 of the Pathions . One gets 3 , and the 10 , each associated with a distinct Box Kite. But that would make for 7 21 , when we know there can only be 35. The extra 3 indicate there s 17 some double duty occurring specifically, 3 of the Rule 1 Trefoil L trips in fact designate not the standard a,d,e , but f,d,b , with 16 in each instance. When 5,14,11 is fed into our trip machine as Rule 0 circle, both 11,16,27 and 14,16,30 map to f,d,b trips tied to Rule 0 Zigzag L indices 10,27,17 and 15,30,17 , whose a,d,e trips appear as rays on triangles for 3,10,9 and 3,13,14 respectively. 11,16,27 also shows as an f,d,b with Rule 0 trip 6,11,13 . Readers are encouraged to use the code in the appendix to , to generate ETs for low S and N. Trip machining details for our . For , use the 35 just derived , and so on. 4 The Number Hub Theorem for 2N ions Given the lengths required to prove the fullness of ETs for , it might be surprising to realize that the infinite number of cases for . Yet the proof of this Number Hub Theorem, while technically trivial, has far reaching implications. Theorem 10. For all 2N ions with ZDs , and G 2, all non long diagonal entries in the emanation table are filled more, each such filled cell in the ET s upper left quadrant is unmarked indeed, indicates an edge current in a Zigzag further, the row, column, and cell entries are isomorphic to those found in an unsigned, CDP generated, multiplication table for the 2N 2 ions finally, the TripN 2 Zigzag L index sets which underwrite its Box Kites are precisely all and only those trips contained in said 2N 2 ions, the ET effectively serving as their high level atlas. Proof. As the largest L index of any Assessor is 2g 1, and each S in the ETs in question is precisely g, then the row column labels will ascend from 1 to g 1 in simple increments from top to bottom left to right in the upper left quadrant, making its square of filled cells isomorphic to unsigned entries in the corresponding 2N 2 ion multiplication table. Also, all these filled cells of the ET will only contain XORs of . Hence, all and only L index trips will have the edges of their necessarily Zigzag Sails residing in said quadrant. All non long diagonal cells in the ET are meanwhile filled, since all candidate Assessors have form m,G g m , and for any CPO triplet a,b,c whose row and column labels plus cell entry are contained in the upper left quadrant, it is easy to show that the following arithmetic is true 18 b G g b a G g a

Chunk: that of this monograph, as this latter is meant to be the theorem proof exposition of that iconic, hence largely intuitive and empirically driven narration. What we ll need to undertake this voyage is a quick reprise of the results from Part I . As the hardest part as a hundred years of denial would imply 2 is finding the right way to think about the phenomenology of zero division, not understanding its basic workings once they re hit upon, such a summary can be much more brief and easy to follow than the proofs required to produce and justify it. We need but grasp 3 rather simple things. First, we must internalize the path and vertex structure of an Octahedron for, properly annotated and storyboarded, this will provide us with the Box Kite representation that completely catalogs ZDs in the 16 D arena where they first emerged and, as we ll see in our Roundabout Theorem herein, underwrites all higher dimensional ZD emergences as well . Second, instead of the cumbersome apparatus of CDP that one finds in algebra texts and the occasional software treatment, we offer two easy algebraic one liners which inspired by Dr. Seuss s Thing 1 and Thing 2 , we simply call Rule 1 and Rule 2 which operate, in almost Pythagorean earnest, on triplets of integers indices of associative triplets among our Hypercomplex Units, as we ll learn , and which, by so doing, accomplish everything the usual CDP tactics do, but without the all too frequent obfuscation. There is also a very useful, albeit quite trivial, Rule 0, which merely states that any integer triple serving to index an associative triplet for one power of N will continue to do so for all higher pow ers. What makes this useful is its allowing us to recursively take triplet givens for lower level 2N ions than those of current interest and toss them into the central circle of the third thing we must grasp. We ll need, that is, to be able to draw the simplest finite projective group s 7 line, 7 node representation, the so called PSL 2,7 triangle. The Rules, plus the Triangle, applied to Box Kite edge tracings and nodal indices, are all we ll need. Indeed, the Box Kite itself can be readily derived from the Triangle, by suppressing the central node, and then recognizing four correspondences. First, see the Triangle s 3 triple noded sides two vertices plus midpoint as the sources of the Box Kite s trio of filled in triangles dubbed Trefoil Sails. Second, link the 1 triple noded circle which is a projective line, after all , wrapped around the suppressed center and threading the midpoints, as the 4th such triangle, the quite special Zigzag Sail. Third, envision the 3 lines from midpoints to angles as underwriting the ZD challenged part of the diagram because ZDs housed at the midpoint node cannot mutually zero divide any housed at the opposite, vertex, node , the struts whence strut constants . Fourth and last, imagine the other four triangles of the Box Kite meeting, as with the first four, each to each, at corners only, like same colored checkerboard squares as the vents where the wind blows. They keep the kite afloat, letting the four prettily colored jib shaped Sails show off, while the trio of wooden or plastic dowels that form the struts thanklessly provide the structural stability that makes the kite able to fly in the first place. 3 As Euclid knew well, 3 points determine a Triangle as well as a Circle which is how we can glibly switch gears between representations based on these projec tive lines. But the easy convertibility of lines to circles is what projective means here and is, as well, at the very heart of linking the above geometrical images to Imaginary Numbers. From Argand s diagram to

Chunk: Riemann s Sphere, this has been the essence of Complex geometry. On the latter image only, place a sphere on a flat tabletop, call the point of contact S for South , and then direct rays from its polar opposite point N. Rays through the equator intersect the table in a circle whose radius we ascribe an absolute value of 1, with center . This circle is just the trace of the usual ei 2 exponential orbit equation, with the i in the exponent, of course, being the standard Imaginary. Any diameter through this circle, extended indefinitely in either direction, is clearly a projective pencil of a circular motion in the plane containing both it and N, and centered on the latter. What each line, then, in the PSL 2,7 triangle represents is a coherent sys tem interrelating 3 distinct imaginaries, one per nodal point that is, a Quater nion copy sans the Reals which latter, like our N,S polar axis in the above, must stand outside the Number Space itself, since 3 D visualization is all used up by the nodes dimensional requirements . Hence, the 7 lines are the 7 interconnected Quaternion copies which constitute the 8 D Octonions. And what makes this espe cially rich for our purposes is the built in recursiveness of this Octonion labeling scheme for higher dimensional isomorphs, embedded in the sorts of ensembles we ll be needing ETs to investigate more thoroughly. To see how this relates to actual integers, take the prototype of the 7 lines in the Triangle, and consider the Quaternions strictly from the vantage of CDP s Rule 1. The first task in studying any system of 2N ions is generating its units, so start with . Treat this singleton as the index of the Real axis i0, that is, is identically 1. Add a unit whose 1 and we have the complex plane. Now, add in a unit whose index is the next available power of 2 with , this is 2 itself. Call this unit and its index G for Generator, and declare this inductive rule the index of the product of any two units is always the XOR of the indices of the units being multiplied but, for any unit with index , the product of said unit, written on the left right , with the Generator written on its right left , has index equal to their indices simple sum, and sign equal opposite to the product of the signs of their units i1 , but i2 . But this is just a standard way of summarizing Quaternion multiplication. Now, set , making . Applying the same logic, but slightly general ized, we get three more triplets of indices. Dispensing with the tedious overhead of explicitly writing the indices as subscripts to explicit copies of the letter i, these 4 are written in cyclical positive order CPO as follows 1,4,5 2,4,6 3,4,7 . CPO is not mysterious it just means read the triplet listing in left right order, and so long as we multiply any unit with any such index by the unit whose index is to the right of it, the third term will result with signing as specified above e.g., i4 i4 . We now have 4 of the Octonions 7 triplets, forming labels on the nodes of 4 of PSL 2,7 s lines. Call the central circle spanning the medians the Rule 0 line the Quaternions starter kit we just fed into our Rule 1 induction machine . Putting , the 3 lines through it are our Rule 1 triplets. If we further array the Quaternion index set 1,2,3 in clockwise order around the 4, starting from the left slope s midpoint at 10 o clock, these lines are all oriented pointing into the angles. Now, with Rule 2, let s construct the lines along the Triangle s sides. Here s

Chunk: is, indices of XOR products only. What s left to do still get our hands messy with the plumbing, and then clean up with a last grand construct. Let s start with the plumbing, and add some notation. Label the Zigzag dyads with the letters A, B, C label their strut opposite terms in the Vent F, E, D respectively. Specify the diagonal lines containing all and only ZDs in any such 7 dyad K as K, and K, for c iK ik and c iK ik respectively, c an arbitrary real scalar. The twelve edges of the octahedral grid are so many pipes, through which course the two way streets of edge currents for the 3 edges of the Zigzag and the 3 defining the opposite Vent , currents joining arbitrary vertices M and N are called negative, since they have this form M, N, M, N, 0 Tracing the perimeter of the Zigzag with one s finger, performing ZD products in natural sequence A, B, , followed by the latter times C, , then this times A, and so forth one should quickly see how the Zigzag s name was suggested. Suppressing all letters, one is left with just this cyclically repeating sequence . Currents along all 6 edges joining Zigzag and Vent dyads, on the contrary, con nect similarly sloping diagonals, hence are called positive, yielding the shorthand sequence for Trefoil sail traversals Z, V, Z, V, 0 Consider the chain of ZD multiplications one can make along the Zigzag, be tween A and B, then B and C, then C and A, for . The first term of this 6 cycle of zero products, once fully expanded, is writable thus A, B, i1 i13 i2 i14 i3 i15 i15 i3 C, C, C, C, 0 We can readily see here where the notion of emanation arises traversing the edge between any two vertices in a Sail yields a balance pan pairing of oppositely signed instances of the terms at the Sail s third vertex ... the 0 being, then, an instance of balanced bookkeeping whence the term Assessor, our synonym for dyad . This suggests the spontaneous emanation of particle anti particle pairings from the quantum vacuum, rather than true emptiness. Finally, a side effect of such Sail dynamics is this astonishing phenomenon each Sail is an interlacing of 4 associative triplets. For the Zigzag, these are the L index a,b,c , plus the 3 U index trips obtained by replacing all but one of these lowercase letters with their uppercase partners ergo, a,B,C A,b,C A,B,c . Ultimately this tells us that ZDs are extreme preservers of order, since they main tain associativity in rigorous lock step patterns, for all 2N ions, no matter how close to their N might become. Put another way, the century long aversion re action experienced by virtually all mathematicians faced with zero divisors was profoundly misguided. 8 2 Emanation Tables Conventions for Construction Theorem 7 guaranteed the simple structure of ETs because any Assessor s up percase index iU is strictly determined by G and S, once we are given these two values, the table need only track interactions among the lowercase indices iL. This will only lead to ambiguities in the very place these are meaningful in the recur sive articulation of a boxes within boxes tabulation of meta fractal or Sky behav iors. In such cases, the overlaying will be as rich in significance as the multiplicity of sheets of a Riemann surface in complex analysis. An ET does for ZD interactivity what a Cayley Table does for abstract groups it makes things visible we otherwise could not see and in a similar way. Each Assessor s L index is entered in a manner we ll soon specify as a row R or column C value, with XOR products P values among them being placed in the spreadsheet

Chunk: cell r,c uniquely fixed by R and C. We ve noted such values only get entered if P is the L index of a legitimate emanation that is, the Assessor it represents mutually zero divides forms DMZs with, for divisors making zero both the Assessors represented by the R and C labels of its cell. As already suggested, the natural use of the letters R, C, P here inspired calling the study of NKS like simple rules for cooking fractals from their bit strings recipe theory. Four conventions are used in building ETs first, their labeling scheme obeys the same nested parentheses ordering we ve already used in designating Assessors A through F, with D, E, F the strut opposites of A, B, C in reverse of the order just written. The L indices, then, are entered as labels running across the top and down the left. The label of the lowest L index is placed flush left abutting the ceiling , with the corresponding label of its strut opposite being entered flush right atop the floor . As there will always be G 2 hence, an even number of indices to enter, repeating this procedure after each pair has been copied to horizontal and vertical labels will completely exhaust them all. Second convention As the point of an ET is to display all legitimate DMZs, any cell whose R and C do not mutually zero divide is left blank even if, in fact, there is a well defined XOR value. Hence, if R and C reference the same Assessor, the XOR of their L indices will be 0 if they reference strut opposites, the XOR will be S. But in both cases, the cell hence, the P value is left blank. All normal ETs, then, will have both long diagonals populated by blank cells, while all other cells are filled. Third convention the two ZD diagonals associated with any Assessor are not distinguished in the ET, although various protocols are possible that would make doing so easy. The reasons are parsimony and redundancy rather than create 9 longer, or twice as many, entries, we assume both entries for the same Box Kite edge will contain the positive sloping diagonal when the lower L index appears as the row label, else the negative sloping diagonal when the higher L index appears first instead. Such niceties won t concern us much here the key thing is that, in fact, all 24 filled cells of a Box Kite s ET entries can be mapped one to one to its ZD diagonals. Recall, per Theorem 3, that both ZD diagonals of an Assessor form DMZs with the same Assessor, according to the same edge sign logic. This leads us to the . . . Fourth convention Although they are superfluous for many purposes, edge signs provide critical information for others, and so are indicated in all ETs pro vided here. Each of a Box Kite s 12 edges conducts two currents one per ZD diagonal and does so according to one or the other orientational option. ZD di agonals are conventionally inscribed so that the horizontal axis of their Assessor plane is the L indexed unit, while the vertical is the U indexed unit. But even if this convention were reversed, the diagonal leading from lower left quadrant to up per right would still correspond to the state of synchrony implied by k iL iU for some Assessor U, we write U, . Conversely, the orthogonal diagonal in dicative of anti synchrony is written U, . If DMZs formed by the Assessors bounding an edge are both of same kind, then we call the edge blue or notate it if Assessors U and V only form DMZs from oppositely oriented ZD diag onals U, V, 0 U, V, 0 then we call the edge red or notate it . However, for ET purposes,

Paris Sud, CNRS UMR 8502, F 91405 Orsay, France and 2Department of Physics, Lancaster University, Lancaster, LA1 4YB, United Kingdom Dated February 15, 2013 We describe a peculiar fine structure acquired by the in plane optical phonon at the point in graphene when it is brought into resonance with one of the inter Landau level transitions in this material. The effect is most pronounced when this lattice mode associated with the G band in graphene Raman spectrum is in resonance with inter Landau level transitions 0 , 1 and , 1 0, at a magnetic field B0 30T. It can be used to measure the strength of the electron phonon coupling directly, and its filling factor dependence can be used experimentally to detect circularly polarized lattice vibrations. PACS numbers 78.30.Na, 73.43. f, 81.05.Uw In metals and semiconductors the spectra of phonons are renormalized by their interaction with electrons. Some of the best known examples include the Kohn anomaly in the phonon dispersion, which originates from the excitation de excitation of electrons across the Fermi level upon the propagation of a phonon through the bulk of a metal and a shift in the longitudinal opti cal phonon frequency in heavily doped polar semiconduc tors . However, despite the transparency of theoretical models the observation of such effects is often obscured by the difficulty to change the electron density in a mate rial, whereas in semiconductor structures containing two dimensional 2D electrons the density of which can be varied, the influence of the latter on the phonon modes is weak due to a negligibly small volume fraction occupied by the electron gas. In this context, a unique opportunity arises in graphene based field effect transistors , where the density of carriers in an atomically thin film mono layer or a bilayer can be continuously varied from 1013cm 2 p type to 1013cm 2 n type. Several Ra man experiments have already been reported where the variation of carrier density in graphene changes the optical phonon frequency, in agreement with theoretical expectations . When graphene is exposed to a quantizing magnetic field, its electronic spectrum quenches into discrete Lan dau levels LLs . Then, the optical phonon energy in graphene may coincide with the energy of one of the inter LL transitions, a condition known as magnetophonon resonance . Recently, Ando has suggested that in undoped graphene the magnetophonon resonance enhances the effect of the electron phonon coupling on a spectrum of the in plane optical phonons the E2g modes attributed to the G band in the Raman spectra in Refs. . In this paper, we investigate a rich structure of the anti crossing experienced by such lattice modes when a magnetic field makes their energy equal to the energy of one of the valley antisymmetric interband magnetoexcitons . Most saliently, the dif ference between circular polarization of various inter LL transitions makes the magnetophonon resonance distinguishable for lattice vibrations of different circular polarization, which makes the number of split lines in the fine structure acquired by a phonon and the value of splitting dependent on the electronic filling factor, . The in plane optical phonons in graphene relative dis placement ux, uy of sublattices A and B have the energy 0.2eV at the point in the center of the Brillouin zone . These phonons and their coupling to electrons can be described using the Hamiltonian , ,q b ,qb ,q g 2M xuy yux , u r X ,q 1 2NucM b ,q b , q e ,qe iq r, where b ,q are annihilation creation operators of a phonon with polarisation e ,q, M is the mass of a carbon atom, and is the charge of an electron. The electron phonon interaction energy u e ,q b ,q b ,q e,q e can be expressed in terms of the phonon wavefunction 0 , (r) = X r,q e,q e . To study the effect of a magnetic field on the Raman spectrum we first calculate the Landau level mixing of the in plane optical phonon (e1g: G band). As a result, we show that one component of these phonons has the wave function of a magnetic quasiparticle with valley and Landau level indices , q, and and q'=q,m+n. The Landau level mixing of the in plane optical phonon is determined by the overlap integrals F (q,q') =q+q'2D ,NxL1Lv(r - r ')exp (-r22D2 / Nx) , L1 +Lv and q L1 = 2piNx /( 2 pi Lv ) , where Nx is the number of carbon atoms per unit length and 2D is the sample width, q' and Lv are the inverse Land

Also, we shall uti lize a double degeneracy of the E2g mode at the point at and describe the in plane optical phonon in terms of a degenerate pair of circularly polarized modes, u ux iuy 2 and u u . The constant g in Eq. characterizes the electron phonon coupling . This coupling has the form of the only invariant linear in u per mitted by the symmetry group of the honeycomb crystal. It is constructed using Pauli matrices x, y acting in the space of sublattice components of the Bloch func tions, K A, K B and K B, K A which describe electron states in the valleys K two opposite corners of the hexagonal Brillouin zone and obey the Hamiltonian, in terms of the electron charge , v p, , xAy . Here, distinguishes between K , and momentum p is calculated with respect to the center of the corre sponding valley.

In a perpendicular magnetic field, Hel determines a spectrum of 4 fold spin and valley degenerate LLs, 2nv 1 B in the valence band , con duction band , and at zero energy , ex actly at the Dirac point in the electron spectrum , in terms of the magnetic length . Such a spectrum has been confirmed by recent quantum Hall effect measurements . In each of the two val leys, the LL basis is given by two component states q 1 2 p 1 n,0 n,m, i 1 n,0 n 1,m , where n,m are the LL wave functions described by the quantum num bers n and m, the latter being related to the guiding center degree of freedom. Here, we neglect the Zeeman effect, and simply take into account the two fold spin de generacy. Excitations of electrons between LLs can be described in terms of magnetoexcitons see Fig. 1 . Those relevant for the magnetophonon resonance are n, i p 1 n,0 N n X m c ,n,m c , n 1 ,m , n, i p 1 n,0 N n X m c , n 1 ,m c ,n,m , where the index A , characterizes the angular mo mentum of the excitation and the operators c ,n,m annihilate create an electron in the state , n, m in the valley K .

Chunk: n 1 occur at much lower magnetic fields, n n 1 2. For example, a resonant phonon coupling with the magnetoexciton A as is ex pected to occur at B1 5T. Its description remains qual itatively similar, though for . . One finds that g g for 2 2n 1 . At 2 2n 1 , filling of the n th LL starts changing, which reduces splitting of the polarized mode and gives rise to the four peak structure. At 2 2n 1 , where the , n LL becomes completely filled, splitting of the polarized phonon vanishes, thus, resulting in the three peak fine structure part III in Fig. 2 b that would persist up to 2 2n 3 . This is because the splitting of the polarized modes remains constant up to the filling factor 2 2n 1 , above which population of the , n 1 LL starts to suppress the value of g , until the latter vanishes at 2 2n 3 see Fig. 2 d . In conclusion, we have predicted a filling factor depen dence of the fine structure acquired by the in plane E2g optical phonon in graphene when the latter is in reso nance with one of the inter LL transitions in this ma terial. The effect is expected to be most pronounced when the phonon is resonantly coupled to the 0 , 1 and , 1 0 transitions, which requires a magnetic field B0 30T. The predicted mode splitting may be used to measure directly the strength of the electron phonon coupling, and also to distinguish between circularly left and right hand polarized lattice modes.

Chunk: off diagonal because a lattice distortion affects the bond length and thus the nearest neighbor hopping between the two different sub lattices . 5 Erratum In the previous version v3 of this Letter, we have underestimated the numerical value of the mode split ting of the magnetophonon resonance see paragraph af ter Eq. by a factor of 2 the text above takes into account the corrected parameters . This is a result of two mistakes. First, there is a factor of 2, which finds its origin in an erroneous normalization of the circular polarized phonons. They should indeed be defined as u ux iuy 2 and u ux iuy 2 and not as u ux iuy and u ux iuy as incorrectly assumed on page 1, second column , such that the asso ciated phonon operators bA obey the usual commutation relations bA, b A A,A , with A , . This yields a factor of 2 in the definition of the effective coupling constants Eq. , which read in the corrected form g n g q 1 n,0 p , n 1 ,n , g n g q 1 n,0 p ,n , n 1 . As a consequence, the zero field dimensionless coupling constant defined in the first column page 3 of our Letter is multiplied by a factor of 2 and becomes 2 3 g t 2. Second, we also underestimated the numerical value of the electron phonon coupling constant g by a factor of 2. Indeed, g defined in our work see Eq. is related to g2 F 0.0405 eV2 computed by Piscanec et al. as g2 F 0.28 eV and not as g2 F 0.2 eV as incorrectly assumed in our Letter. In addition, there is a substantial uncertainty in the precise value of the constant g. In a tight binding model, the latter may be related to the derivative of the hopping amplitude t as a function of the carbon carbon distance a as dt da 3 2 M . Harrison s phenomenological law t 1 a2 then implies that g 0.26 eV. Experiments in graphene and in zero magnetic field give for the dimensionless coupling constant the values 4.4 10 3 and 5.3 10 3 respectively. This determines g in between 0.3 eV and 0.36 eV, where we take into account that the value of t lies between 2.7 and 3 eV. In the end, we have to take g in the range between 0.26 and 0.36 eV instead of g 0.2 eV and therefore the dimensionless coupling constant becomes 2.8 to 5.3 10 3 instead of 10 3 . As a result of the two factors of 2, the numerical estimate for the mode splitting 2gA at 0 and B 30 T at the discussed resonance , 1 0 and 0 , 1, see second column of page 3 becomes 2gA 15 meV 120 cm 1 , for g 0.26 eV and 2gA 20 meV 160 cm 1 for g 0.36 eV instead of 2gA 8 meV . The effect is therefore twice larger than initially predicted. The conclusions of our work remain unaltered. We would like to thank C. Faugeras and M. Potemski for having drawn our attention on the underestimated value of the mode splitting. See also their recent preprint where they measure the magnetophonon resonance . T. Ando, J. Phys. Soc.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0029v2 hep ph 26 Apr 2007 Understanding the Flavor Symmetry Breaking and Nucleon Flavor Spin Structure within Chiral Quark Model Zhan Shu, Xiao Lin Chen, and Wei Zhen Deng Department of Physics, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China Abstract In QM, a quark can emit Goldstone bosons. The flavor symmetry breaking in the Goldstone boson emission process is used to intepret the nucleon flavor spin structure. In this paper, we study the inner structure of constituent quarks implied in QM caused by the Goldstone boson emission process in nucleon. From a simplified model Hamiltonian derived from QM, the intrinsic wave functions of constituent quarks are determined. Then the obtained transition probabilities of the emission of Goldstone boson from a quark can give a reasonable interpretation to the flavor symmetry breaking in nucleon flavor spin structure. PACS numbers 12.39. x, 12.39.Fe, 14.20.Dh Electronic address dwz th.phy.pku.edu.cn 1 I. INTRODUCTION The measurements of the polarized structure functions of the nucleon in deep inelastic scattering DIS experiments show the complication in proton spin structure. Only a portion of the proton spin is carried by valence quarks. Moreover, several experiments clearly indicate the u d asymmetry as well as the existence of the strange quark content s in the proton sea. Also the distribution of strange quark in the proton sea is polarized negative. The DIS results deviate significantly from the na ve quark model NQM expectation. NQM gives many fairly good descriptions of hadron properties. Why does NQM work? It is a puzzle that the quarks inside a hadron could be treated as non relativistic particles in NQM. The chiral quark model QM tries to bridge between QCD and NQM. It was originated by Weinberg and formulated by Manohar and Georgi . Between the QCD confinement scale QCD 200MeV and a chiral symmetry breaking scale SB 1GeV , the strong interaction is described by an effective Lagrangian of quarks q, gluons g and Numbu Goldstone bosons . An important feature of the QM is that, betweetn QCD and SB, the internal gluon effects in a hadron can be small compared to the internal Goldstone bosons and quarks q, so the effective degrees of freedom in this region can be q and . It is interesting that QM can also be used to explain why NQM does not work in the above DIS experiments. By the emission of Goldstone boson, QM allows the fluctuation of a quark q into a recoiling quark plus a Goldstone boson q q . The q system then further splits to generate quark sea through the helicity flipping process q q q q q and the helicity non flipping process q q q q q where the subscript indicates the helicity of quark. In both the process, q is in a relative P wave state. In the helicity flipping process , the orbital angular momentum along helicity direction must . In the helicity non flipping process , 0. The process cause a modification of the spin content of the nucleon because a quark changes its helicity 2 in . Also it causes a modification of the flavor content because the generated quark sea from is flavor dependent . QM was first used to explain the nucleon sea flavor asymmetry and the smallness of the quark spin fraction by Eichten, Hinchliffe and Quigg . The flavor asymmetry of sea quark distribution arises from the mass differences in different quark flavors and in different Goldstone bosons. Only the lightest Goldstone Boson was considered since its contribution dominates. From a perturbation calculation, the probability for an up quark to emit a was estimated to be .083. This would induce a flavor asymmetry in parton distributions of nucleon and other hadrons. However, the estimated transition probability is not enough to full account the flavor asymmetry in DIS experiments. Contribution from other s and even was considered by Cheng and Li . Explicit SUf

Chunk: . The proton wave function for example, is expressed as P, 1 2 0.90 P 2 8 SS 0.34 P 2 8 S S 0.27 P 2 8 SM where the baryon SU O wave functions are denoted as B2S 1 N L , N is SU mul tiplicity. S, L are the total spin and total orbital angular momentum while S, M, A denotes the permutation symmetry of SU . The spin polarization functions will be re markably affected by configuration mixing. Following refs. 15, 17, we define the number operator by u nu u nd d nd d ns s ns s , where nq , nq are the number of q , q quarks. The spin structure of the mixed proton is given by P P, 1 2 N P, 1 2 0.902 0.342 5 3u 1 3u 1 3d 2 3d 0.272 4 3u 2 3u 2 3d 1 3d . The spin structure after considering emission is obtained by replacing for every quark in eq. by q , 1 Pi q , Pflipping q , Pnon flipping q , , 10 where Pflipping q , and Pnon flipping q , are the probabilities of quark helicity flipping and non flipping for q , respectively. For example, in the case of u quark we have, Pflipping u 2 3 xu u 0 2 xu u 2 u xu d 2d xu sK 2s , and Pnon flipping u 1 3 xu u 0 2 xu u 2 u xu d 2d xu sK 2s . Finally the spin polarization functions defined as q are 0.902 0.342 4 3 114 xu u 0 2 48 xu u 2 36 xu sK 2 27 0.272 2 3 66 xu u 0 2 24 xu u 2 18 xu sK 2 27 , 0.902 0.342 1 3 6 xu u 0 2 12 xu u 2 9 xu sK 2 27 0.272 1 3 42 xu u 0 2 12 xu u 2 9 xu sK 2 27 , xu sK 2 3 . There are several measured quantities which can be expressed in terms of the above spin polarization functions. The quantities usually calculated are u d 2 s, obtained from the neutron decay and the weak decays of hyperons respectively. Another important quantity is the flavor singlet component of the total quark spin content defined as 2 u d s . We also calculate some weak axial vector form factors which are also related to the spin polarization functions, GA GV 2 u d s , GA GV , and GA GV 1 3 u d 2 s . IV. BARYON OCTET MAGNETIC MOMENTS Considering the relative angular momentum between quark and Goldstone boson , the magnetic moment operator of a q system is q eq mq s eq 2pp2q m2q p p2 m2 pp2q m2q p p2 m2 l e 2 p p2 m2 pp2 q m2 q pp2q m2q p p2 m2 l 11 where eq and e are the electric charges carried by q and respectively, s the quark spin operator and l the relative angular momentum bewteen q and . The first term in Eq is the intrinsic magnetic moment of quark and the other two terms are the contribution of the orbital angular momentum. Here we have to consider the relativistic effect since the relative momentum of q or are comparable to their masses in the q system pq, mq, . With the SHO wave functions of , the magnetic moment of q system can be readily calculated. Then we can recalculate the magnetic moments of constituent quarks taking into account of the relativistic effect. For example, the magnetic moments of the u quark is zu 2 Pu u 0 Pu u Pu d Pu sK , , and the contribution from q is Zu 2 Pd u 0 Pu d Pu d Ps , . The final mass and magnetic moments of the constituent quarks are then obtained by averaging over the isospin and flavor states. Finally, the magnetic moments of the octet baryons are obtained by averaging over the helicity states.

The magnetic moments of d and s quarks can be calculated similarly. One can easily obtain the octet baryon magnetic moments by replacing the valence quarks inside the baryons with the corresponding constituent quarks. Again we take proton as an 12 example, 0.902 0.342 4 3 u 1 3 d 0.272 2 3 u 1 3 d . If we replace the q by , p can be further expressed as the baryon magnetic moment in conventional quark model plus the contribution from the Goldstone boson emission process . The magnetic moments for other octet baryons can be calculated similarly. V. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS In the numerical calculation, most of the parameters can be taken from the experimental data or the chiral quark model. We collect these fixed input parameters of our calculation in Table I. Here we have used the the physical masses of Goldstone bosons . TABLE I The fixed input parameters from chiral quark model and experimental data. gA f MeV m MeV mK MeV m MeV 0.7524 93 135 494 548 For the quark masses, since our work focuses on the inner context of the constituent quarks in quark model, naturally we will refer to the quark masses from quark model, instead of the chiral quark model values. Here we will use the quark mass values from the widely accepted Isgur s quark model as shown in Table II. However, one should be cautious that, in our model, it is the quark with the Goldstone boson mixing which corresponds to the constituent quark in quark model. That is, mass values Mq after the diagonalization process should be set to the quark masses in Isgur s model. Our strategy is to adjust the quark masses mq in the model Hamiltonian to fit the Mq values. Finally we are left only with one free parameter which describes the confinement of the emitted Goldstone boson in our model. An overall fit to the experimental data of nucleon flavor spin structure and octet baryon magnetic moments shows that the best value should be 152MeV. With this value of and a minimun binding energe , the bare values of quark masses mq without Goldstone boson mixing are shown also in Table II. Transition probabilities of the light and strange quarks to various q systems are given in Table III and IV respectively. The probability of a u quark emitting a P u 13 TABLE II The quark masses with vs. without Goldstone boson mixing. EB MeV mu,d MeV ms MeV Mu,d MeV Ms MeV 152 218 288 474 220 419 d 0.145 is significantly larger than the perturbation calculation .083. One may notice that the parameter value 152MeV in our wave function, which is below QCD, is rather small than another energy scale QM in chiral quark model. Surely this will weaken the interaction between q and q . However, one should also notice that the binding energy system much close to the single quark energy. This will enhance the mixing of q components in a constituent quark. Also, we notice that the asymmetry between the probabilities of u d s

Chunk: related. The results in Figure 2 for the static limit 0 0 , together with the fact that second order IPT is known to give reasonable results in the instan taneous limit 0 , suggest that the calculation of spectral functions should also be reliable at intermediate frequencies. We note that Freericks et al. also find a reasonable agreement between the IPT and QMC self energies at half filling, and that this should lead to a good agreement in the Matsub ara axis Green s function. We have therefore solved the IPT equations for the spectral functions at intermediate frequencies. We show the results in Fig 3. The results of the IPT calculations in the regime of intermediate cou pling Fig 3 are consistent with known results for the limiting cases. For frequencies 0, the system has the qualitative behavior of the static limit The original unperturbed density of states splits into two sub bands centered around U 2. For small frequencies U, 0 and interaction strength, U, less than some critical value, the system behaves as an in teracting electron Hubbard model, since the retarded interaction between particles U i s see equation 2 is effectively constant for s 0. There is then a narrow quasiparticle band at the Fermi energy with density of states at the Fermi energy pinned at its non interacting value 6. We also note that the results for small coupling and small frequencies are in good agreement with those calculated using ME theory in the metallic phase 22. The recent renormalization group NRG calculations of Meyer et al. 23,24 also report the spectral function in the intermediate regime. The NRG is in principle an exact method for solving the impurity problem onto which the DMFT equations map. Our results are largely consistent with theirs adding further support to the use of IPT in the intermediate regime. When comparing with the results of Meyer et al 23, one should note that the Hamil tonian is exactly the one considered in Ref. 23 but with the quantity g 2M 0 2 denoted by g in Ref. 23 and with energies measured in terms of the full bandwidth instead of the half bandwidth used here . In this paper, we work with the Gaussian density of states for the non interacting electron DOS, whereas reference 23 uses the semi elliptic DOS. In general, we would expect the critical values for the opening of a gap to be larger for the Gaussian case than for the semi elliptic case. The critical coupling for the parameters in Figure 3 c lies just above .0, corre sponding in the units used in Ref. 23 to , compared with the critical value found for the semi elliptic DOS of .69 note that because of the different energy scales . However, the shapes of the spectral functions are similar in both cases, with a five peaked structure below and four peaked structure above the transition. The peaks are narrower in the IPT results than in the NRG results and there is less weight in the high energy peaks. This may reflect the different DOS, or inaccuracies in the NRG method at frequencies far from the Fermi energy resulting from the logarithmic discretisation, but more likely the limitations of the IPT method. Using the method outlined in section 2. it is possible to calculate the real axis self energy. The temperature evolution of the imaginary part of the self energy may be seen in figure 4 for Fermi liquid like behavior consistent with the narrow quasiparticle peak seen in the spec tral function Fig 3 and develops to a broad central peak at higher tem peratures. There are also peaks corresponding to the Hubbard sub bands. With increasing temperature these phonon induced peaks move together and merge into the single central maximum associated with incoherent on site scattering. This peak is naturally characterized

Chunk: at the LHC . Crystal capture is very selective in angle. The critical angle C within which the capture is possible is as small as about 5 rad E1 2 TeV at a high energy E in Silicon planes. Proton divergence of 150 rad is almost 100 times C at 7 TeV. Therefore it is not possible to capture all these protons by a plain crystal. However, we can suggest an efficient solution benefiting from the fact that all diffractively scattered protons originate from a small region at the IP. For standard LHC optics with beta function value at the IP 0.55 m, the beam size at the IP is beam 16 m rms. The spread in the transverse position of the vertex point where outgoing protons originate from is determined by the rms spread of the beam and equals beam 2 . As protons emerge from diffractive scattering at LHC with emission angles up to 150 rad and interaction width beam 2, the emittance of the beam to be trapped by a crystal is 2 rad mm only. This corresponds to the acceptance of a Si crystal of 1 mm transverse size. The match of the diffractive protons emittance to the crystal acceptance means that the particles could be http mail.ihep.ru biryukov trapped and channeled efficiently. To realize this, one has to match the crystal design and location to the application. For the LHC scenario with high luminosity, we find the most efficient design to be a crystal with a point to parallel focusing entry face. Focusing crystal proposed by A.I Smirnov in 1985 has a face shaped so that the tangents to the crystal planes cross at a focus line at some distance LF from the crystal . This kind of crystal was successfully tested at IHEP where it efficiently trapped a beam of 2 mrad divergence or 100 times C . The crystal traps protons emerging from the focus line uniformly from all the angular range if the entry face has a proper shape . We find that for most efficient channeling in the LHC the focus distance LF of this crystal should be equal to the effective distance Leff between the crystal location and the IP. In a drift space, Leff is geometrical distance. In accelerator lattice, Leff C 1 2sin , where C is value at the crystal and is the phase advance from the IP to the crystal. A plain crystal with a flat entry face has . In simulations with the low optics settings, a focusing crystal shows best efficiency if installed at a location with effective distance Leff 15 m from the IP. It can be a Si or crystal of 0.15 mrad Leff 2.5 mm transverse size in order to capture efficiently all diffractive protons. Simulation predicts that a focusing Si crystal with of 7 TeV protons emerging from the IP in the angular range of 150 rad width into channeling mode. The efficiency figure is almost independent of the crystal location provided Leff 15 m. The reason for high efficiency at high Leff is that, at a distance Leff from the IP, any point at the crystal entry face sees the beam source of size at the IP at an angle of Leff. Channeling efficiency reduces by a factor of about 1 Leff C 2 1 2 . The reduction in efficiency by a factor of 1 2 2L2 eff C 2 becomes negligible for L2 eff 2 2 C 2 4 C 2 where is beam emittance. With 0.55 m and Si crystal, channeling efficiency saturates for L2 eff 4 m 2. One more idea for efficient channeling of forward protons in the LHC is that a crystal can be installed with planes parallel to either x or y plane. For application, it is not critical whether crystal bends protons in horizontal or vertical plane to produce an offset

Chunk: at the detector. But the distance Leff in accelerator lattice from the IP to the crystal can be very different in x and y planes. Then channeling efficiency is very different, whether crystal traps protons in x or y plane. We suggest in this case to install crystal for channeling in the plane with larger Leff. For instance, on the location 200 m downstream of the IP5 CMS and some 20 m ahead of the Roman Pot station at 220 m where crystal could be installed, Leff 6 m in x and 20 m in y plane. According to the analysis above, channeling efficiency in y plane should be great while in x plane moderate. Indeed, our simulations for this location show channeling efficiency of 87 in y and only 60 in x plane, for 0.55 m and optimal crystals of Si . A plain Si crystal has channeling efficiency in x plane of just 3.5 or 17 times lower than a Si focusing crystal adapted to the LHC lattice. For the run in phase of the LHC with 2 m we find that channeling efficiency of 85 can be achieved if crystal is located at Leff 30 m downstream of the IP. The nominal, high luminosity optics of the LHC is not optimized for forward proton detection. Therefore a possibility to use a channeling crystal can be very helpful as it offers opportunities for diffractive physics studies otherwise inaccessible in the nominal LHC settings. The LHC options with a high 1540 and 90 m are devised for the studies of diffractive physics. With 1540 m, the emittance of diffractively scattered protons increases to 50 rad mm. This corresponds to the acceptance of a Si crystal of 30 mm transverse size. Such a crystal is not out of question, however the problem is where to fit it in the LHC. In terms of Leff, good channeling efficiency requires a location with L2 eff 130 m 2 in this optics. We simulated channeling on the location 200 m from the IP5. In 1540 m optics, a 10 cm Si crystal trapped and bent protons 0.5 mrad in x plane with efficiency of 41 . A Ge crystal shows there 48 efficiency, i.e. comparable to Si. All figures assumed a perfect match . A plain Si crystal gives efficiency of 1 , or 300 times lower than a Si focusing crystal adapted to the LHC lattice on this location. In 90 m option on the same location, the choice of plane is important because Leff 10 m in x and 170 m in y plane. Preferred location should have L2 eff 60 m 2 so we expect very different efficiencies in x and y planes. Our simulations give crystal efficiency of 72 in y and only 7 in x plane for 90 m. Here, crystal application is feasible only with bending in vertical plane. Low efficiency may exclude a crystal use for double pomeron exchange events pp pXp with double arm reconstruction, because the probability to have channeling in both arms in coincidence becomes small, e.g. 41 2 17 . For reconstruction of single diffraction events pp pX more detailed studies are required before the benefits or their absence from a crystal use with high options can be understood. In this paper we suggest the use of a single crystal for proton extraction from halo and delivery to the detector. The use of a 2 stage crystal system , first crystal for extracting a proton and second one for bending it a big angle, would reduce the overall efficiency by a factor of 0.6 ideally or less. The 2nd crystal traps only part of the protons channeled in the 1st one. Finally, we notice that one can filter diffraction events with a crystal. Instead of trapping all forward protons, crystal acceptance can be made smaller and sample e.g. only the most forward

Chunk: probe . The resolution of the image transmitted by a crystal is 0.2 rad in both planes. In terms of the critical channeling angle C, the obtained resolution is an order of magnitude finer than C while the size of the trapped and channeled area can be some orders of magnitude greater than C. In the applications there is no point to have a crystal transmission too perfect. It should match the other sources of inaccuracy like a multiple scattering in the detectors and vacuum chambers, etc. By tuning crystal parameters, in principle, one could very much improve in precision of the beam image downstream of the crystal but loose in brightness of the image, i.e. in statistics rate, as the efficiency of crystal transmission could be affected. Finally, we suggest another idea for the channeling plane a microscope idea that improves not only the crystal accuracy but even the detector resolution in that plane. Crystal can magnify beam image in one plane, e.g. transform the entrance values x, x , y, y into exit values x, Nx , y, y . The magnification factor N can be as big as 2 or 10 or even 100, and serve the purpose to increase strongly the overall angular resolution in x . In the above examples, the overall resolution was 1 rad defined by detector resolution. With magnification optics, the overall inaccuracy in x would be effectively reduced by factor N, bringing it below 0.1 rad rms. Magnification is realized by making the shape of the crystal exit face different from the entry face. With a magnification factor of 10, e.g., the entry angular opening of 50 rad would correspond to the exit opening of 500 rad. 5. Conclusion We have shown in simulations that crystal lattice can trap with 90 efficiency a beam with a x , y distribution much broader than a critical angle C. To achieve that, one has to match the crystal focus length to the effective length between the particle source and the crystal in the accelerator lattice. Crystal adaptation to accelerator lattice improved channeling efficiency up to 300 fold. Crystal can transmit the trapped particles in channeled states with the phase space x, x , y, y , E distribution preserved with accuracy an order of magnitude finer than C. Several solutions were proposed and supported by simulations for achieving a fine resolution in crystal transmission. This may give a beam instrument for collision products in colliders. Usually, accelerator beam instruments prepare particles for collision by cooling them, bending, focusing, etc. Detectors sort out the results of collision. We change this a bit by introducing crystal optics between the collision point and detectors. A crystal adapted to the LHC lattice can trap with 90 efficiency all protons emerging from the IP with divergence of 150 rad or 100 C. The trapped protons can be channeled to detectors with precision down to 0.1 rad rms. This makes feasible a crystal application for the measurement of diffractive scattering in CMS and ATLAS at the LHC. While we showed the physical capabilities of crystal channeling, its actual application in the LHC environment has to take into account many technical considerations to fit into existing infrastructure of accelerator and detectors. Crystal channeling of LHC forward protons can improve proton acceptance in momentum loss and four momentum transfer t both in TOTEM and FP420 and allow to reach the smallest possible value of the scattering angle . Now the sensitive detector area starts at 12 15 from the LHC beam . Crystal can be placed at 6 from the LHC beam as it is very small, cm Si, and does not provoke beam instability. Such a crystal can trap and deliver a very useful information on most forward high momentum quasi elastic and elastic protons at LHC, unavailable otherwise. There are practical benefits as well. Crystal would relax tough requirements

Chunk: on needed for TOTEM. Crystal may allow TOTEM to run at the early start of the LHC, possibly running in parallel to other experiments. Thanks to crystal, FP420 detectors could possibly reside out of the cold region. The detectors don t need to be edgeless. Crystal works best with low , where FP420 is interested most. If detectors can be more distanced from the beam, background conditions may improve. For injection, the active areas of the detectors must be kept away from the beams and then moved back instead, one can move a crystal. Crystal can be introduced to experiment on a later stage in an attempt to expand the horizons of the physics program.

Chunk: C. Atmospheric and accelerator neutrinos Non standard interactions involving muon neutrinos can be constrained by atmospheric neutrino experiments as well as accelerator neutrino oscillation searches at 3 K2K and MINOS. In Ref. Super Kamiokande and MACRO observations of atmospheric neutrinos were con sidered in the framework of two neutrinos. The limits ob tained were 0.05 dV 0.04 and dV dV 0.17 at 99 CL. The same data set together with K2K were recently considered in Refs. to study the nonstan dard neutrino interactions in a three generation scheme under the assumption e 0. The al lowed region of obtained for values of e smaller than O 10 1 becomes ,d,e fV Nf Ne 0.2 , where Nf stands for the fermion number density. D. Cosmology If non standard interactions with electrons were large they might also lead to important cosmological and as trophysical implications. For instance, neutrinos could be kept in thermal contact with electrons and positrons longer than in the standard case, hence they would share a larger fraction of the entropy release from e annihi lations. This would affect the predicted features of the cosmic background of neutrinos. As recently pointed out in Ref required couplings are, though, larger than the current laboratory bounds. E. NSI in Supernovae According to the currently accepted supernova SN paradigm, neutrinos are expected to play a crucial role in SN dynamics. As a result, SN physics provides a laboratory to probe neutrino properties. Moreover, many future large neutrino detectors are currently be ing discussed . The enormous number of events, O 104 105 that would be seen in these detectors in dicates that a future SN in our Galaxy would provide a very sensitive probe of non standard neutrino interaction effects. The presence of NSI can lead to important conse quences for the SN neutrino physics both in the highly dense core as well as in the envelope where neutrinos basically freely stream. The role of non forward neutrino scattering processes on heavy nuclei and free nucleons giving rise to flavor change within the SN core has been recently analyzed in Ref. . The main effect found was a reduction in the core electron fraction Ye during core collapse. A lower Ye would lead to a lower homologous core mass, a lower shock energy, and a greater nuclear photon disintegration burden for the shock wave. By allowing a maximum .02 it has been claimed that e 10 3, where , . On the other hand it has been noted since long ago that the existence of NSI plays an important role in the propagation of SN neutrinos through the envelope lead ing to the possibility of a new resonant conversion. In contrast to the well known MSW effect it would take place even for massless neutrinos . Two basic ingredients are necessary universal and flavor changing NSI. In the original scheme neutrinos were mixed in the leptonic charged current and universality was violated thanks to the effect of mixing with heavy gauge singlet leptons . Such resonance would induce strong neu trino flavor conversion both for neutrinos and antineutri nos simultaneously, possibly affecting the neutrino sig nal of the SN1987A as well as the possibility of having r process nucleosynthesis. This was first quantitatively considered within a two flavor e scheme, and bounds on the relevant NSI parameters were obtained using both arguments . One of the main features of the such internal or massless resonant conversion mechanism is that it re quires the violation of universality, its position being determined only by the matter chemical composition, namely the value of the electron fraction Ye, and not by the density. In view of the experimental upper bounds on the NSI parameters such new resonance can only take place in the inner layers of the supernova, near the neu trinosphere, where Ye takes its minimum values. In this region the values of Ye

Chunk: are small enough to allow for resonance conversions to take place in agreement with existing bounds on the strengths of non universal NSI parameters. The SN physics implications of another type of NSI present in supersymmetric R parity violating models have also been studied in Ref. , again for a system of two neutrinos. For definiteness NSI on d quarks were considered, in two cases i massless neutrinos without mixing in the presence of flavor changing FC and non universal NU NSIs, and ii neutrinos with eV masses 4 and FC NSI. Different arguments have been used in order to constrain the parameters describing the NSI, namely, the SN1987A signal, the possibility to get suc cessful r process nucleosynthesis, and the possible en hancement of the energy deposition behind the shock wave to reactivate it. On the other hand several subsequent articles considered the effects of NSI on the neutrino propa gation in a three neutrino mixing scenario for the case .4, typical for the outer SN envelope.

All the derivations in this section can in principle be extended to interfaces inside the particle, i.e. when a surface, which cannot be described exactly as a surface of a set of cubes, separates two regions where r varies smoothly. Two parts of the cubical dipole on the interface should be considered separately the same way as it was done above. This will however not change the main conclusion of this section Eq. but only the constants. F.Different DDA formulations In this section we discuss how different DDA formulations modify the error estimates derived in Sections 2.D and 2.E. Most of the improvements of PP proposed in the literature are concerned with the self term . They are the Radiative Reaction correction RR , , i iV r M 8 the Digitized Green s Function DGF ,23 the formulation by Lakhtakia LAK ,26,27 the a1 term method,28,29 the Lattice Dispersion Relation LDR ,30 the formulation by Peltoniemi PEL ,31 and the Corrected LDR CLDR .32 All of them provide an expression for that is of order d , i iV r M 2 except for RR that is of order d3 . For instance LDR is equivalent to i i i d d S m b m b b V P r M 3 2 2 3 2 2 1 i 3 2 , , remember that we assumed where b , b2, b3 are numerical constants and S is a constant that depends only on the propagation and polarization vectors of the incident field. However, none of these formulations can exactly evaluate the integral in Eq. , because the variation of the electric field is not known beforehand PEL solves this problem, but only for a spherical dipole . Therefore they hopefully decrease the constant in Eq. , thus decreasing the overall error in the measured quantities. However, these formulations are not expected to change the order of the error from d2 to some higher order. We do not analyze the improvements by Rahmani, Chaumet, and Bryant RCB 33,34 and Surface Corrected LDR SCLDR ,17 as they are limited to certain particle shapes. There exist two improvements of the interaction term in PP Filtered Coupled Dipoles FCD 12 and Integration of Green s Tensor IT .35 A rigorous analysis of FCD errors is beyond the scope of this paper, but it seems that FCD is not designed to reduce the linear term in Eq. that comes from the incomplete non symmetric shells. This is because FCD employs sampling theory to improve the accuracy of the overall discretization for regular cubical grids. FCD does not improve the accuracy of a single ij G calculation approximation of an integral over one subvolume . IT, which numerically evaluates the integral in Eq. , has a more pronounced effect on the error estimate.

Draine8 proposed a modification of Eq. that was widely used afterwards and which was further modified by Chaumet et al.35 However, for many cases these expressions are equivalent and, even when they are not, the difference is of order d3, which is neglected in our error analysis. 3. Numerical simulations A.Discrete Dipole Approximation The basics of the DDA method were summarized by Draine and Flatau.2 In this paper we use the LDR prescription for dipole polarizability,30 which is most widely used nowadays, e.g. in the publicly available code DDSCAT 6.1.4 We also employ dipole size correction8 for non cubically shaped scatterers to ensure that the cubical approximation of the scatterer has the correct volume this is believed to diminish shape errors, especially for small scatterers.2 We use a standard discretization scheme as described in Section 2.E, without any improvements for boundary dipoles. It is important to note that all the conclusions are valid for any DDA implementation, but with a few changes for specific improvements as discussed in Section 2.F. Our code Amsterdam DDA ADDA is capable of running on a cluster of computers parallelizing a single DDA computation , which allows us to use practically unlimited number of dipoles, since we are not limited by the memory of a single computer.37,38 We used a relative error of residual as a stopping criterion for the iterative solution of the DDA linear system. Tests suggest that the relative error of the measured quantities due to the iterative solver is then data not shown and hence can be neglected total relative errors in our simulations are see Section 8 5 6 10 10 0 .

Chunk: main theoretical results concerning DDA convergence boundedness of errors by a quadratic function, cf. Eq can be formulated and applied without consideration of any constants which is simpler . However our full derivation enables us to make additional conclusions related to the behavior of specific error terms. The total number of dipoles used to discretize the scatterer is 3 . We assume that the internal field E is at least four times differentiable and all these derivatives are bounded inside V 6 5 4 3 2 , , , , r E r E r E r E r E for V r and , , , . This assumption is acceptable since there are no interfaces inside V, therefore E should be a smooth function. . denotes the Euclidian L2 norm, which is used for all 3D objects vectors and tensors. We use the L1 norm, 1. , for N dimensional vectors and matrices as well as for functions and operators. Eq. immediately implies that . We require that satisfies Eq. 1 V L E with constants 7 11. Further we will state an estimate for the norm of R G and its derivatives.

However, it's mentioned that "d_0 depends on its choice." To understand this better, I recommend referring to the paper by Rahola (Reference 25 in the chunk), where the author discusses the discretization of the spectrum for scattering by a sphere. The rigorous relationship between d_0 and the incident field choice can be better understood from this source.

Chunk: with varying parameters because all these constants depend on 2 6, 13 that in turn depend in a complex way upon the parameters of the scattering problem. However we can make one conclusion about the general trend of this dependency. Following the derivation of the Eq. one can observe that c61 is proportional to 12, while c59 and c60 do not directly depend on it at least part of the contributions to them are independent of 12 . Therefore the general trend will be a decrease of the ratio 59 61 c c with increasing x when all other parameters are fixed . This is a mathematical justification of the intuitively evident fact that surface errors are less significant for larger particles. In the analysis of the results of the numerical simulations Section 0 we will neglect the variation of the logarithm. Eq. then states that error is bounded by a quadratic function of y for . However, keep in mind that our derivation does not lead to an optimal error estimation, i.e. it overestimates the error and can be improved. For example, the constants 0 d d 2 6 are usually largest inside a small volume fraction of the scatterer near the surface or some internal resonance regions , while in the rest of the scatterer the internal electric field and its derivatives are bounded by significantly smaller constants. However the order of the error is estimated correctly, as we will see in the numerical simulations. 11 It is important to note that Eq. does not imply that y which is a signed value actually depends on y as a quadratic function, but we will see later that it is the case for small enough y Section 0, see detailed discussion in Paper 2 . Moreover, the coefficients of linear and quadratic terms for y may have different signs, which may lead to zero error for non zero y however, this y, if it exists, is unfortunately different for each measured quantity . E.Shape errors In this section we extend the error analysis as presented in Section 2.D to shapes that cannot be described exactly by a set of cubical subvolumes. We perform the discretization the same way as in Section 2.B but some of the Vi are not cubical for V i , which denotes that dipole i lies on the boundary of the volume V . We set ri to be still in the center of the cube circumscribing Vi not to break the regularity of the lattice. The standard PP prescription uses equal volumes in Eqs. 3 d , , , and , i.e. the discretization changes the shape of the particle a little bit. We will estimate the errors introduced by these boundary dipoles. These errors should then be added to those obtained in Section 2.D. We start by estimating 1 d h . First we consider for d i h V i V j j ij V i d i d r j P G r P r r G h 0 3 3 , d , which is just a reduction of Eq. . For V i is the same plus the error in the self term d i h i i i i i i i j V j j ij V i d i V V d r j E r L r M P G r P r r G h 3 4 , , , d 0 3 3 .

Chunk: Sent to Nature in 1990 Abstract This is a supplement to the paper arXiv q bio 0701050, containing the text of correspondence sent to Nature in 1990. Origin of adaptive mutants a quantum measurement? Sir, Several recent works described non random induction of adaptive mutations by environmental stimuli 1 3. The most obvious explanation of this striking phenomenon would be that activation of gene expression leads to the enhancement of its mutation rate4. However, this does not work with the lacZ mutations described by Cairns and co workers as the true inducer of the lac operon is not lactose as such, but allolactose, a by product of the galactosidase reaction5. So, in lacZ mutants the operon is not induced by lactose6. Besides, induction of respective genes would not explain the high fraction, among the revertants, of suppressor mutations in tRNA genes1,7 Other explanations suggest some special mechanisms for the acceleration of adaptive evolution , like selection of useful protein coupled to specific reverse transcription1. However, any mechanism of this type also should have emerged in evolution. I propose that, to explain the adaptive mutation phenomenon, there is no need for any new ad hoc mechanism. The only thing that is necessary is to return to the old discussion of the role of quantum concepts in our understanding of life. This alone will allow the explanation of this manifestly Lamarckian phenomenon by Darwinian selection, occurring not in a population of organisms as usual, but in a population of virtual, in the direct quantum theory sense, states of each distinct cell. Thus, this hypothesis may be called selection of virtual mutations . Detailed substantiation of this concept will be presented in a special publication below I briefly show how this explanation might work. It has been shown by the Cairns group that the mutations ensuring cell growth begin to accumulate not immediately after plating, but only after conditions are created under which such mutations become useful , as if the mutations are induced by these conditions1. I suggest that, to explain this phenomenon, we should change our ideas about what a cell is, and consider not actual but virtual mutations. An important distinction of virtual mutations is that they do not accumulate with time in stationary cell, whereas the number of actual mutants would grow linearly from the moment of plating, and this would yield drastically different results in experiments like those shown in Fig. 3 of Ref. 1. Virtual mutations produce delocalization of the cell among different states, similarly to the delocalization of electron in physical space. However, for a virtual mutation to become an actual one, certain conditions are necessary, namely the possibility to grow, leading the system away irreversibly from the initial state. Such conditions arise when, for example, lactose is added to a plate with lacZ bacteria. Briefly, this is the essence of the proposed explanation. What is a virtual mutation? The main cause of usual spontaneous mutations is the well known base tautomerization8 having the in vitro frequency of about 10 4 . Thus could we reduce virtual mutation to such tautomerization? I believe that this view is not consistent with experiments, as it implies that the same rare tautomeric form should work both in transcription and in replication. If these processes are considered independent, we logically arrive to the leaky mutant, which was refuted by Cairns and coworkers1. Thus we need to postulate a correlation between the recognition of the tautomeric forms in transcription and in replication, making us to define virtual mutation as a certain state of the cell as a whole. Analogous reasoning is applicable to the adaptive transpositions discussed by Cairns. In other words, we consider the whole cell as a quantum system, with non negligible nonlocality inherent in such systems. Most of all it resembles the systems of generalized rigidity 9, such as superfluid or superconducing states of matter, whose behavior is

Hoekstra Faculty of Science, Section Computational Science, of the University of Amsterdam, Kruislaan 403, 1098 SJ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands alfons sciene.uva.nl Abstract We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of the discrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this technique was studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using many different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with refining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for cubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was demonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were proven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate shape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case. Keywords discrete dipole approximation, non spherical particle light scattering, accuracy, extrapolation OCIS code 290.5850, 260.2110, 000.4430 2 1. Introduction The discrete dipole approximation DDA is a well known method to solve the light scattering problem for arbitrary shaped particles. Since its introduction by Purcell and Pennypacker1 it has been improved constantly. The formulation of DDA summarized by Draine and Flatau2 more than 10 years ago is still most widely used for different applications,3 partly due to the publicly available high quality and user friendly code DDSCAT.4 DDA directly discretizes the volume of the scatterer and hence is applicable to arbitrary shaped particles. However, the drawback of this discretization is the extreme computational complexity of DDA of O N 2 , where N is the number of dipoles. This complexity is decreased to O NlogN by advanced numerical techniques.2,5 Still the usual application strategy for DDA is single computation , where a discretization is chosen based on available computational resources and some empirical estimates of the expected errors.3,4 These error estimates are based on a limited number of benchmark calculations3 and hence are external to the light scattering problem under investigation. Such error estimates have evident drawbacks, however no better alternative is available. Usually errors in DDA are studied as a function of the size parameter of the scatterer x at a constant or few different values of N , e.g. 2,6. Only several papers directly present errors versus discretization parameter e.g. d the size of a single dipole .7 15 The range of d typically studied in those papers is limited to a 5 times difference between minimum and maximum values with the exception of two papers9,10 where it is 15 times . Only two papers7,15 use extrapolation to zero d to get an exact result of some measured quantity, however they use the simplest linear extrapolation without any theoretical foundation nor discussion of its capabilities. It is acknowledged for a long time that DDA errors are due to two different factors shape it is not always possible to describe the particle shape exactly by a collection of cubical cells and discretization finite size of each cell .6 However, the question which of them is more important in different cases is still open. A discussion on this issue spanned through several papers16 20 that have not reached any definite conclusions yet. The uncertainty is due to the indirect methods used that have inherent interpretation problems. In accompanying paper,21 that from now on we will refer to as Paper 1, we performed a theoretical analysis of DDA convergence when refining the discretization. It provides the basis for this paper, where an

Chunk: errors are less than the estimates. There are only two exceptions, both for the the fourth extrapolation of Qext Table 1 real error 1.8 times larger than estimate and second of S11 real error 1.5 2 times larger than estimate for broad range of data not shown . The existence of such exceptions is acceptable since the estimates have a statistical nature of a confidence interval. However, these estimates, though reliable, are definitely not optimal, i.e. they often significantly overestimate the real errors e.g. Fig. 5 a . It also seems to be sensitive to the spacing of y values used for extrapolation cf. Fig. 4 c , where unusually broad spacing was used. Generally this overestimation increases with increasing ymin. We can conclude that the error estimate should be improved, and this is subject of future research. However, the current estimate is already suitable for practical applications since they mainly require reliability of the error estimate, which is demonstrated empirically in this paper. It is important to note that we limited ourselves to a single value of m. While bounds of ymin to obtain satisfactory extrapolation definitely dependent on m, other conclusions, such as 14 the reliability of the error estimate, are expected to hold true for a broad range of m. This can be easily tested for specific values of m of interest using the methodology put forward in this paper. Finally we discuss the results presented in Fig. 8. One cannot conclude that shape errors dominate over discretization errors or the other way around for some shape errors are much larger than discretization, for others vice versa. However, maximum errors occurring in backscattering directions are definitely due to shape errors ratio of maximum shape to maximum discretization errors is about 4 . Errors in Qext Table 2 are, on the contrary, mostly due to discretization although they are almost two orders of magnitude smaller than maximum errors of S11 . One may expect shape errors to become even more important for smaller values of y, since the linear component of discretization errors is significantly smaller than that of shape errors hence for large values of y shape errors scale linearly and discretization almost quadratically . Our single result principally shows different angle dependence of shape and discretization errors of S11 shape errors have a clear tendency to significantly increase towards backscattering, while the general trend of discretization errors is uniform over the whole range. We have presented a simple method to directly separate shape and discretization errors and only one result for illustration. All previous comparisons of shape and discretization errors had significant inherent interpretation problems that caused a lot of discussions about their conclusions.16 20 Our method is free of such problems and therefore can be used for rigorous study of shape errors in DDA. For instance, it can help to directly evaluate the performance of different techniques to reduce such errors, e.g. weighted discretization WD .9 Discretization errors are then the limit one can achieve by drastically reducing shape errors. We have used a traditional DDA formulation2 to show that the extrapolation technique can be used with current DDA codes e.g. DDSCAT4 without any modifications. However, as we showed in Paper 1 several modern improvements of DDA namely integration of Green s tensor IT 33 and WD should significantly change the convergence behavior of DDA computations and hence influence the performance of the extrapolation technique. IT should completely eliminate the linear term for cubically shaped scatterers. This will improve the accuracy especially for small y, and probably also improve the quality of the extrapolation for such scatterers. WD should significantly decrease shape and hence total errors for non cubically shaped particles, moreover it should significantly decrease the amplitude of quasi random error oscillations because it takes into account the location of the interface inside the boundary dipoles. Therefore WD should improve the quality of the

Chunk: show the potential power of our approach. We do not attempt to choose the most suitable fit options, but merely demonstrate the applicability of the technique. We start by analyzing the second question, i.e. what is the expected deviation from the quadratic model, i.e. what is the functional dependence of y on y, to be used as weighting function in the polynomial fitting procedure? For cubically shaped particles, defined in Paper 1 as particles whose shape can be exactly discretized using cubical subvolumes, one expects a smooth variation of the function y, and the error can be attributed as a model error, i.e. coming mainly from neglecting higher order terms in the convergence analysis of Paper 1. In that case the error y is expected to be a cubical function of y. We have tried cubical, quadratic and linear error functions when fitting results for cubically shaped particles and found that, although the differences are small, cubical errors generally lead to the best fits data not shown . Shape errors, which are present for non cubically shaped particles, are expected to be very sensitive to y, because they depend upon the position of the particle surface inside the boundary dipole that changes considerably by a small variation of y for details see Paper 1 . 3 Therefore shape errors can be viewed as random noise superimposed upon a smooth variation of y. The asymptotic behavior of shape errors is linear in y see Paper 1 . Indeed, in certain cases we found that using linear errors y results in significantly better fits than when using cubical errors. However in other cases linear errors performed significantly worse. In our experience, using a cubical error function is in general always more reliable, even in the presence of shape errors, because it decreases the influence of points with high values of y, where the error is larger and less predictable. Since we want the procedure to be as robust as possible and not to use more complex error functions than strictly needed e.g. polynomial , we take a cubical dependence of the error y, both for cubically and non cubically shaped scatterers. The choice of values of y for computation can be described by the interval ymin,ymax , the number of points and their spacing. ymin is usually determined by available computer hardware time or memory bounds , that is the best discretization that can be computed for a given resource. The goal of the extrapolation procedure is to increase the accuracy beyond this single DDA boundary . We will show in Section 3.B that the overall performance of this technique strongly depends upon ymin. The choice of ymax is governed by two notions a larger interval of data points generally leads to better extrapolation but errors for high values of y are more random and their significance is anyway much smaller since we use a cubical error function . We have found that for cubically shaped scatterers a good choice is min max 2y , while for non cubically shaped scatterers increasing the interval to min max 4y . Probably that is due to the fact that the quality of fit for non cubically shaped scatterers is determined by quasi random shape errors and increasing the range leads to larger statistical significance of the result. We will also demand that ymax is less than 1, since otherwise DDA is definitely far from its asymptotic behavior. Spacing of the sample points depends partly on the problem, especially for cubically shaped scatterers in that case an arbitrary number of dipoles cannot be used . We space computational points approximately uniform on a logarithmic scale, acknowledging the fact that a relative difference in y is more significant than an absolute. The total number of points should be large enough for statistical significance. However, a large number of points increases computational time. We have used 5

1. How can the cubical error function improve the reliability of the fitting procedure?
2. What is the optimal range and spacing of sample points for accurate particle shape analysis?
3. Can increasing the range for non-cubically shaped scatterers improve the fitting results and if so, why?<

Note: The text is focused on a potentially powerful approach to estimating uncertainties in particle shape from DDA simulation results. The technique involves fitting polynomial functions to the data. The text discusses different error functions and sampling strategies. There are different types of particles: cubically shaped and non-cubically shaped. For cubically shaped particles, a cubical error function leads to more reliable fits compared to cubical or linear errors, but for non-cubically shaped particles, the choice depends on the scatterer. The range and spacing of sample points can influence the fitting results, with a good choice for cubically shaped scatterers being ymin and ymax 2y, and for non-cubically shaped scatterers, increasing the range can lead to better results due to increased statistical significance. Spacing computational points uniformly on a logarithmic scale ensures statistical significance too. The number of points should be

Chunk: points for cubically shaped particles ratio of y 1 values is 8 7 6 5 4 and 9 points for non cubically shaped particles ratio of y 1 values is 16 14 12 10 8 7 6 5 4 or less if min max 4y . The estimation of the error of the final result is difficult since this error is due to model imperfection and not to some kind of random noise. The standard least square fitting technique22 provides a standard error SE for the parameter a0, which we use as a starting point. Numerical simulations Section 3.B show that for spheres the only non cubical shape we studied real errors are less than 2 SE in most cases. That is what one would expect if y is considered completely random which is similar to the expected behavior of the shape errors . For cubical shapes, on the contrary, we have to estimate the error as 10 SE to reliably describe the real errors. It is important to note that an error estimate based on the SE is the simplest one can use. Its drawback is that we have to use a large multiplier based on the real errors obtained in some of our simulations , which may lead to significant overestimation of real errors in certain cases. We can now formulate the step by step extrapolation technique. We use abbreviations c and nc for cubically and non cubically shaped scatterers respectively. 1 Select ymin based on your computational resources. 2 Take ymax to be 2 c or 4 nc times ymin but not larger than 1. 4 3 Choose 5 c or 9 nc points over the interval ymin,ymax approximately uniformly spaced on a logarithmic scale. 4 Perform DDA computations for each y. 5 Fit the quadratic function Eq. over the points using y , y y 3 as errors of data points a0 is then the estimate of 0. Multiply SE of a0 by 10 c or 2 nc to obtain an estimate of the extrapolation error. Results of using this procedure are presented in Section 3, together with computational costs. The extrapolation procedure is similar to a Romberg integration method,22 which is adaptive. The error estimate, obtained by extrapolation, is an internal accuracy indicator of DDA computations that is just as important as the increase in the accuracy itself. Our error estimate opens the way to adaptive DDA, i.e. a code that will reach a required accuracy, using minimum computational resources. 3. Numerical simulations A.Discrete Dipole Approximation The basics of the DDA method were summarized by Draine and Flatau.2 In this paper we use the LDR prescription for dipole polarizability,23 which is most widely used nowadays, e.g. in the publicly available code DDSCAT 6.1.4 We also employ dipole size correction6 for non cubically shaped scatterers to ensure that the cubical approximation of the scatterer has the correct volume this is believed to diminish shape errors, especially for small scatterers.2 We use a standard discretization scheme without any improvements for boundary dipoles. The main numerical challenge of DDA is to solve a large system of 3N linear equations. This is done iteratively using some Krylov subspace method,22 while the matrix vector products are computed using an FFT based algorithm.5 Our code Amsterdam DDA ADDA is capable of running on a cluster of computers parallelizing a single DDA computation , which allows us to use practically an unlimited number of dipoles, since we are not limited by the memory of a single computer.24,25 We used a relative error of residual as a stopping criterion. Tests suggest that the relative error of the measured quantities due to the iterative solver is then data not shown and hence can be neglected total relative errors in our simulations are see Section 8 5 6 10 10 3.B . All DDA simulations were carried out on the Dutch national compute cluster LISA.26

2. The number of iterations is found to slightly depend on the discretization parameter y.
3. The estimated computational overhead for the extrapolation technique compared to a single DDA computation for y = 5, 9 points is an increase in execution time of 5.2 min (y = 9) and memory requirements of the same magnitude as a single computation. For a single DDA computation, an increase from 5 points to 9 points adds only 2 to 4 times increase in accuracy.

Chunk: theory is available for the cube and the discretized sphere, which could provide us with exact results. Instead, we use extrapolation over the 5 finest discretizations as reference results for these shapes. 6 , as an example, simulation results of Qext for the cube. Instead of showing values of Qext itself, we show in Fig. 2a 1 0 ext a Q , with a0 obtained through fitting the 5 finest discretizations. The extrapolation through these 5 best points , is also shown. The deviation of the fit from the five best points that overlap on 047 .0 .0 . 2 a is very small indeed. This is also characterized by a small estimate of the extrapolation error see 6 10 8.1 Table 1 . In Paper 1 we proved that DDA converges to the exact solution, therefore the result of the best extrapolation should be close to the exact result. The relative difference between the best discretization and the best extrapolation is only , therefore it does not make a big difference which one to use as a reference when evaluating, for instance, the error of the extrapolation through the 5 worst 5 10 0.9 0 cube 5 best points discretized sphere 5 best points Signed relative error of Qext, a b sphere 9 best points sphere 9 best points sphere 9 best points Signed relative error of Qext, m Fig. 2.

Fig. 2 a depicts results for the cube and the discretized sphere. The 5 best points for each scatterer are fitted by a quadratic function, using the method described in Section 2. Fig. 2 b depicts extrapolation results for spheres, using the 9 best points for each of them cf. Section 2 . Since the exact Mie solution is available, intersection of a fit with a vertical axis is a measure of the accuracy of extrapolation result.

Errors of the two best extrapolations for the using 9 points from the intervals 0.059,0.23 and 0.12,0.47 are shown in Fig. 6 a and b respectively. A third extrapolation for sphere is not satisfactory data not shown . Both extrapolations for the sphere show similar controversial results, only one of them 9 points from the interval 0.18,0.70 that is overall slightly better is shown in kD Fig. 7. The estimate of the extrapolation error is overall slightly higher than the real errors of the extrapolation data not shown . Results of S11 for all extrapolations see Table 1 support the following trend the quality of the extrapolation defined as decrease of error compared to a single DDA computation for ymin rapidly degrades with increasing ymin. The ratio of estimated to real errors increase with increasing ymin that can be considered as a degradation of the estimate quality . Computation of exact results for both the allows us for the first time to directly separate and compare shape and discretization error of single DDA computations. The shape error is the difference between some measured quantity for a discretized sphere calculated to a high accuracy and that for the exact sphere. The discretization error is difference between calculation using a limited number of dipoles and exact very accurate solution for the cubical discretization of the sphere first curve in 93 . . 4 c .

Usually 10 dipoles per wavelength in the medium is used in applications. 6. ,12,13 or of light scattering by particles much smaller than a wavelength then d is determined by a shape of a scatterer, and y, being proportional to scatterer size, can be arbitrarily small .32 However, if one wishes to achieve better than usual accuracy of a DDA simulation, smaller y must be used. The best extrapolation for the cube Fig. 3 a shows a large improvement compared to the best single DDA calculation it should be noted, however, that this result is based on the empiric error estimate . Maximum errors are decreased more than 2 orders of magnitude. This would be impossible to reach by a single DDA calculation as it will require over 6 orders of magnitude increase in execution time and memory, since there is only linear convergence for such small y. Even for the extrapolation can be called satisfactory because the maximum error is decreased almost two times when considering the estimate of the error the real errors are even less . It is important to note that an estimate of the error is important by 38 .0 Scattering angle , deg .18 extrapolation Fig. 7.

Comparison of discretization and shape errors of S11 for single and extrapolated DDA computations. The extrapolated DDA computations Fig. 7 show smaller errors than the single DDA computations Fig. 6 a and b for S11, indicating that extrapolations improve the accuracy of single DDA computations. The ratio of estimated to real errors is overall slightly smaller than 1 for extrapolated DDA computations while it exceeds 1 for single DDA computations indicating that the estimate quality is slightly worse than real error. The estimated to real error ratio increases with increasing ymin, which can be considered as a degradation of the estimate quality . Table 1 and Fig. 8 show that the total error is overall slightly smaller for extrapolated DDA computations than for single DDA computations. The trend of decreasing error with increasing ymin is visible in the results for both DDA computations while it is less pronounced for the extrapolated DDA computations . However, the extrapolated DDA computations show lower errors overall than the single DDA computations, indicating that the extrapolation improves the accuracy of DDA computations. 0 30 60 90 120 15

These reactions can be modeled by 3n 3 differential algebraic equations according to mass action kinetics ds0 konisie koffici kcati 1ci 1 loni 1sif loffi 1di lcatidi 1, , . . . , n 1 dcj koffj kcatj cj, , . . . , n 1 ddk loffk 1 lcatk 1 dk, , . . . , n, together with the algebraic conservation equations , , .

For each , C, let us define a set Z , C . Observe that, by definition, given x R3n 3 , x is a positive steady state of , C if and only if x Z , C . So, the mathematical statement of the central problem in this paper is to count the number of elements in Z , C . Our analysis will be greatly simplified by a preprocessing. Let us introduce a function R3n 3 R6n 6 R3 R3n 3 with components 1, . . . , 3n 3 defined as 1 n 1 i n i 2n i 1 i 1, , . . . , n j, , . . . , 3n 3.

Chunk: any 0, 0 , we have as n 1 distinct positive roots of F , ,Stot , u . The case when n is odd can be proved similarly. The above theorem shows that when Etot Ftot is sufficiently small, it is always possible for the futile cycle to have n 1 n steady states when n is even odd , by choosing appropriate kinetic constants . 10 We should notice that for arbitrary , the derivative of F at each positive root may become zero, which breaks down the perturbation argument. Here is an example to show that more conditions are needed with , , , 6, , , , , we have that F , ,Stot 0, u 3u3 12u2 15u u 1 2 u 2 has a double root at .

Theorem 2 For each positive numbers Stot, , and vector R6n 6 satisfying condition , there exists , Etot satisfying 1Stot , the number of positive steady states of system , C is greater or equal to the number of positive roots of F , ,Stot 0, u . Proof. Suppose that F , ,Stot 0, u has m roots u1, . . . , um. Applying Lemma 2, we have F , ,Stot u 0, uk 0, , . . . , m. 11 By the perturbation arguments as in Theorem 1, we have that there exists F , ,Stot , u has at least m roots for all 1. The above result depends heavily on a perturbation argument, which only works when Etot Ftot is sufficiently small. In the next section, we will give an upper bound of the number of steady states with no restrictions on Etot Ftot, and independent of and C. 4.2 Upper bound on the number of steady states Theorem 3 For each , C, the system , C has at most 2n 1 positive steady states. Proof. An alternative approach to solving is to first eliminate v from instead of from , i.e. 1 u Etot Ftot 2 u A u B u , when u 1 u Etot Ftot 2 u 0. Then, we substitute into , and multiply by u 1 u Etot Ftot 2 u 2 to get P ,C u 0 2 Etot Ftot u 2 0 Stot 2 Ftotu 1 Ftot 2 Etot Ftot u u 1 Etot Ftot 2 Stot u 1 Etot Ftot 2 . Therefore, if u 1 u Etot Ftot 2 u 0, the number of positive solutions of is no greater than the number of positive roots of P ,C u . In the special case when u 1 u Etot Ftot 2 u 0, by , we must have , and thus 1 Etot Ftot 2 Etot Ftot . Substituting into , we get a unique v defined as in with . But notice that in this case ,C u , so also in this case the number of positive solutions to is no greater than the number of positive roots of P ,C u . It is easy

Chunk: a single computer . Recently the overall performance of the code has been improved significantly, together with some optimizations specifically for single processor mode. ADDA s source code and documentation is freely available. Most of ADDA is written in ANSI C, which ensures wide portability on the source code level. The code is fully operational under Linux and, in sequential mode, on Windows based systems. The parallelization over multiple processors is based on a geometric decomposition of the particle and the single program multiple data paradigm of parallel computing. The code is written for distributed memory systems using the message passing interface MPI .2 Note that ADDA should in principle also run on shared memory computers, but so far this was not explicitly tested. The fast Fourier transform FFT used for the matrix vector products in the iterative solver is performed either using routines by Temperton or the more advanced package Fastest Fourier transform in the West FFTW . The latter is generally considerably faster but requires a separate package installation. ADDA has four options implemented for dipole polarizabilities Clausius Mossotti , radiative reaction correction , lattice dispersion relation LDR , and corrected LDR . It includes four iterative methods conjugate gradient applied to normalized equation with minimization of residual norm CGNR , Bi CG stabilized Bi CGSTAB , Bi 1 http www.science.uva.nl research scs Software adda 2 http www.mpi forum.org 2 CG , and quasi minimal residual QMR . The last two iterative methods employ the complex symmetric property of the DDA interaction matrix to halve the calculation time . The default stopping criterion of the iterative method in ADDA is the relative norm of the residual , which must be . 5 inc 1 i i j j ij i i E P G , where i is the tensor of dipole polarizability, is incident electric field, inc i E ij G is the free space Green s tensor complex symmetric , and Pi is the unknown dipole polarization. If the polarizability tensor is diagonal for all dipoles then there always exists a i such that i i i , i.e. i i . Moreover, i is then complex symmetric, and so is the matrix with elements j i j i j ij i ij , , G I A , where I is an identity tensor. A is the interaction matrix that is used in ADDA, i.e. the following system of linear equations is solved inc i i i j j j ij i i j j ij E x G x x A , where i i i P x is a new unknown vector. Eq. is equivalent to the use of Jacobi preconditioning together with keeping the interaction matrix complex symmetric for any distribution of refractive index inside the scatterer and for any of the supported polarization prescriptions . We have not studied, however, whether this Jacobi preconditioning improves the convergence of the iterative solver. Flatau showed that in some test cases it helps, while in others there is no improvement. It is important to note also that DDA is not limited to diagonal or symmetric polarizabilities. Any other tensor may be used, but then the interaction matrix is not complex symmetric hence, QMR and Bi CG are less efficient. ADDA can perform orientation averaging of the scattering quantities over three Euler angles , , of the particle orientation. Averaging over the angle is done with a single computation of internal fields by computing scattering in different scattering planes, which is comparably fast. Averaging over the other two Euler angles is done by independent DDA simulations. The averaging itself is performed using a Romberg integration , which may be used adaptively i.e. automatically simulating the required number of different orientations to reach a prescribed accuracy but limits the possible number of values for each orientation angle to be , where n is an integer. Moreover,

Chunk: symmetries of the scatterer may be used to decrease the intervals of Euler angles, over which to average, and hence accelerate the calculation. This feature of ADDA was tested in a recent benchmark study . 1 2 n Other features of ADDA include computation of scattering by a tightly focused Gaussian beams , a checkpoint system to allow for long runs on queuing systems that enforce upper limits on wall clock time for execution as is usually the case on massively parallel supercomputers, calculation of radiation forces on each of the dipoles , use of rotational symmetry of the scatterer to halve the simulation time, and an extended command line interface. Some other features, such as applicability to anisotropic scatterers and a large set of predefined shapes, are planned to be implemented in the near future. There are several factors that allow ADDA s performance to compare favorably with other codes, which was shown in a benchmark study by Penttila et al. . First of all, the FFTW 3 package that is used automatically adapts itself to optimally perform on any particular hardware. Moreover, ADDA does not perform complete 3D FFT transforms in one run, but decomposes them into a set of 1D transforms with data transposition in between. This allows employing the fact that input data for the forward transform contains many zeros, and 3 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2 GB 10 5,10 3 Refractive index m Size parameter x 10 5 70 GB Fig. 1.

The dashed lines show two levels of memory requirements for the simulation, according to the rule of thumb see main text for explanation . only part of the output data of the backward transform is used . Second, we have implemented four different Krylov space based iterative solvers, allowing us to choose the most suitable one for a particular application. As is known from the literature and demonstrated in Section 3, there is not a best iterative solver for DDA. Depending on all details of the scattering problem, any of the methods may outperform the others. Third, dynamic memory allocation and optimized data structures allow all computations, except the FFT, to be performed only for the real non void dipoles and not for the whole computational box. This also decreases ADDA s memory consumption. Moreover, symmetry of the interaction matrix is used to decrease memory required for its Fourier transform. Finally, all float variables in ADDA are represented in double precision. This accelerates convergence in cases when machine precision becomes important. Moreover, basic operations with double precision numbers can be faster than with single precision ones on modern processors. This acceleration comes at a cost of increased memory consumption, which is, however, still lower than for other computer codes . More information on ADDA can be found in an extensive manual included in the distribution package. 3 Numerical simulations 3.1 Simulation parameters In our tests we used ADDA v.0.75, compiled with the Intel C compiler v.9.0 with maximum possible optimizations default options in ADDA s makefile . All the tests were run on the Dutch compute cluster LISA,3 using 32 nodes each dual Intel Xeon 3.4 GHz processor with 4 GB RAM . LDR was used as the most common polarization formulation. We have tried three different iterative solvers QMR, Bi CG, and Bi CGSTAB. For all of them a default stopping criterion was used. 5 3 http www.sara.nl userinfo lisa description 4 Table 1.

They correspond to typical memory of a modern desktop computer 2 GB and the maximum total memory used in our simulations 70 GB , respectively. For each sphere we computed the extinction efficiency, the asymmetry parameter, and all Mueller matrix elements in one scattering plane, which is a symmetry plane of the cubical discretization of the sphere. Exact results for the same spheres were obtained using the Mie theory . Spherical symmetry was used by ADDA to get all results from calculations for only one polarization state of the incident field. Therefore computation time is a factor of two smaller than for non symmetric scatterers with the same x and m. We employed a volume correction to ensure equal volumes of sphere and its dipole representation . Note, however, that for the very large spheres this correction is extremely small. 3.2 Results Table 1 shows the iterative solver that provided the best performance for each particular case and the number of iterations to achieve convergence.

Chunk: to DDA . A distinctive feature of this graph compared to the literature data is that the convergence slows down with iteration number, i.e. the logarithm of the residual norm decreases slower than linearly. This is probably due to the large size of the scatterer and loss of numerical precision see discussion below . The total computation times t increase steeply both with x and m Fig. 3 . The time is displayed in a logarithmic scale covering a range from 4 seconds to more than 2 weeks. For , the increase of t with x is mostly due to the increasing number of dipoles to model the scatterer, since the number of iterations increase at a slower pace 05 . . For larger m these two effects are comparable, combining into a very unfavorable scaling, which can be approximately described by a power law , where m x m C t for . It should be noted that both the number of iterations and t do not always increase monotonically with x. For example for , and 2.1 m . x , 4. . This may be caused by a large condition number of DDA interaction matrices for these two 9 particular particles. Moreover, when the convergence is slow it may suffer from machine precision, the latter determining the limit of x and m, for which ADDA will converge at all. Therefore, current size limitations of the DDA for are due to the practically unbearable computation times, and not due to memory requirements. 2.1 m 5 Simulations for larger m are far from the memory limit shown in Fig. 1. Moreover, simply using more processors does not solve the problem. Improving numerical performance is required, e.g. dedicated preconditioning of the iterative solver . On the other hand, extension to larger sizes for is feasible if more computer resources are available. This facilitates, for example, simulating scattering of visible light by almost all biological cells in suspension. 2. however, there is still no theoretical foundation to describe it in details. Rahola provided theoretical predictions of the dependence of the number of iterations on m, valid for scatterers smaller than the wavelength. However, these conclusions are not applicable to the scatterers studied in this manuscript. The general reason for the slowing down of the convergence with increasing m is increased interaction between dipoles and, hence, an increased condition number of the interaction matrix. Absorption, if present, should decrease the overall interaction between dipoles in a large scatterer. Therefore, it is expected that convergence for complex refractive indices should be better than for the purely real ones that we consider here. The same was suggested by Budko and Samokhin based on the analysis of the spectrum of the integral scattering operator. However, this proposition is still to be verified by numerical tests. Another parameter that may greatly affect the computation time is the convergence threshold . In this paper it is set to a de facto default value of 10 5 , which ensures negligibly small numerical errors compared to the model errors. However, in many cases numerical errors are small enough already for , i.e. the difference of the scattering quantities between simulations with and is significantly smaller than the difference between the latter and the exact values data not shown . 3 3 5 Fig. 2 shows that QMR for a particular case converges to and three and six times faster respectively than to . Results for other simulated particles and iterative solvers show similar trends and even larger acceleration with increasing in some cases data not shown . Therefore, if one can determine an optimum for a particular case, it can decrease the computation time significantly. However, we do not pursue this issue further in this manuscript. 3 3 10 2 5 Fig. 4 shows the deterioration of the accuracy of Qext with increasing m, while there is no

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0039v2 hep ph 25 Apr 2007 Scalar radius of the pion and zeros in the form factor Jos e A. Oller and Luis Roca Departamento de F sica. Universidad de Murcia. E 30071, Murcia. Spain. oller um.es , luisroca um.es Abstract The quadratic pion scalar radius, s , plays an important role for present precise deter minations of scattering. Recently, Yndur ain, using an Omn es representation of the null isospin I non strange pion scalar form factor, obtains .75 0.07 fm2. This value is larger than the one calculated by solving the corresponding Muskhelishvili Omn es equations, .61 0.04 fm2. A large discrepancy between both values, given the precision, then results. We reanalyze Yndur ain s method and show that by imposing continuity of the re sulting pion scalar form factor under tiny changes in the input phase shifts, a zero in the form factor for some S wave . Once this is accounted for, the resulting value is .65 0.05 fm2. The main source of error in our determination is present experimental uncertainties in low energy S wave phase shifts. Another important contribution to our error is the not yet settled asymptotic behaviour of the phase of the scalar form factor from QCD. 1 Introduction The scalar form factor of the pion, t , corresponds to the matrix element t Z d4x e i q q x q mu u x u x md d x d x q , q q 2 . Performing a Taylor expansion around , t 1 1 6t s O t2 , where s is the quadratic scalar radius of the pion. The quantity s contributes around 10 to the values of the S wave scattering lengths a0 0 and a2 0 as determined in ref. , by employing Roy equations and PT to two loops. If one takes into account that this reference gives a precision of 2.2 in its calculation of the scattering lengths, a 10 of contribution from s is a large one. Related to that, s is also important in SU SU PT since it gives the low energy constant l4 that controls the departure of F from its value in the chiral limit at leading order correction. Based on one loop PT, Gasser and Leutwyler obtained .55 0.15 fm2. This calculation was improved later on by the same authors together with Donoghue , who solved the corresponding Muskhelishvili Omn es equations with the coupled channels of and K K. The update of this calculation, performed in ref. , gives .61 0.04 fm2, where the new results on S wave phase shifts from the Roy equation analysis of ref. are included. Moussallam employs the same approach and obtains values in agreement with the previous result. One should notice that solutions of the Muskhelishvili Omn es equations for the scalar form factor rely on non measured T matrix elements or on assumptions about which are the channels that matter. Given the importance of s, and the possible systematic errors in the analyses based on Muskhelishvili Omn es equations, other independent approaches are most welcome. In this respect we quote the works , and Yndur ain s ones . These latter works have challenged the previous value for s, shifting it to the larger .75 0.07 fm2. From ref. the equations, a0 .027 r2 , a2 .004 r2 , give the change of the scattering lengths under a variation of s defined by .61 1 r2 fm2. For the difference between the central values of s given above from refs. , one has .23. This corresponds to a0 .006 and a2 .001, while the errors quoted are a0 .220 0.005 and a2 .0444 0.0010. We then adduce about shifting the central values for the predicted scattering lengths at the level of one sigma. The value taken for s is also important for determining the O p4 PT coupling l4.

Chunk: The value of ref. is .4 0.2 while that of ref. is .4 0.5. Both values are incompatible within errors. The papers have been questioned in refs. . The value of the K quadratic scalar radius, K s , obtained by Yndur ain in ref. , K .31 0.06 fm2, is not accurate, because he relies on old experiments and on a bad parameterization of low energy S wave 2 phase shifts by assuming dominance of the resonance as a standard Breit Wigner pole . Fur thermore, K s was recently fixed by high statistics experiments in an interval in agreement with the sharp prediction of , based on dispersion relations three channel Muskhelishvili Omn es equations from the T matrix of ref. and two loop PT . From the recent experiments , one has for the charged kaons K .235 0.014 0.007 fm2, and for the neutral ones KL .165 0.016 fm2. The prediction of , in an isospin limit, is K .192 0.012 fm2, lying just in the middle of the experimental determinations. Another issue is Yndur ain s more sound determination of the pionic scalar radius, whose in correctness is not settled yet. In this paper we concentrate on the approach of Yndur ain to evaluate the quadratic scalar radius of the pion based on an Omn es representation of the . Our main conclusion will be that this approach and the solution of the Muskhelishvili Omn es equations , with and K K as coupled channels, agree between each other if one properly takes into account, for some T matrices, the presence of a zero in the pion scalar form factor at energies slightly below the K K threshold. Precisely these T matrices are those used in and favoured in . Once this is considered we conclude that .63 0.05 fm2. The contents of the paper are organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss the Omn es rep resentation of t and derive the expression to calculate s. This calculation is performed in section 3, where we consider different parameterizations for experimental data and asymptotic phases for the scalar form factor. Conclusions are given in the last section. 2 Scalar form factor The pion scalar form factor t , eq. , is an analytic function of t with a right hand cut, due to unitarity, for t 4m2 . Performing a dispersion relation of its logarithm, with the possible zeroes of t removed, the Omn es representation results, t P t exp t Z 4m2 s s s t ds . Here, P t is a polynomial made up from the zeroes of t , with . In the previous equation, s is the phase of t P t , taken to be continuous and such that 4m2 0. In ref. the scalar form factor is assumed to be free of zeroes and hence P t is just the constant the exponential factor is 1 for . Thus, t exp t Z 4m2 s s s t ds . From where it follows that, Z 4m2 s s2 ds . One of the features of the pion scalar form factor of refs. , as discussed in ref. , is the presence of a strong dip at energies around the K K threshold. This feature is also shared by the strong S wave amplitude, t . This is so because t is in very good approximation purely 3 elastic below the K K threshold and hence, neglecting inelasticity altogether in the discussion that follows, it is proportional to sin ei , with the S wave phase shift. It is an experimental fact that is very close to around the K K threshold, as shown in fig.1. Therefore, if happens before the opening of this channel the strong amplitude has a zero at that energy. On the other hand, if occurs after the K K threshold, because

Experimental data are from refs. . Because of Watson final state theorem the phase s in eq. is given by s below the K K threshold, neglecting inelasticity due to 4 or 6 states as indicated by experiments . The situation above the K K threshold is more involved. Let us recall that t e2i 1 2i , with 0 1 and the inelasticity is given by 1 2, with the elasticity coefficient. We denote by s the phase of t , required to be continuous below 4m2 K it is given by s . By continuity, close enough to the K K threshold and above it, 1 and then we are in the same situation as in the elastic case. As a result, because of the Watson final state theorem and continuity, the phase s must still be given by s . For sK , , s does not follow the increasing trend with energy of s but drops as a result of eq. , see fig.2 for sK . This is easily seen by writing explicitely the real and imaginary parts of t in eq. , t 1 2 sin 2 i 2 1 cos 2 . 4 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000 s 1 2 MeV 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 s2 degrees GeV4 1000 1100 1200 1300 1400 1500 1600 s 1 2 MeV 0 100 200 300 400 degrees sK 180 o sK 180 o as as Figure 2 Left panel Strong phase s , eigenvalue phase s and asymptotic phase as s .

The imaginary part is always positive 1 above the K K threshold and 1.1 GeV while the real part is negative for , but in an interval of just a few MeV the real part turns positive as soon as , fig.1. As a result, s passes quickly from values below but close to to the interval 0, 2 . This rapid motion of s gives rise to a pronounced minimum of t at this energy, as indicated in ref. and shown in fig.3. The drop in s becomes more and more dramatic as sK with the superscript indicating that the limit is approached from values above below , respectively and in this limit, sk sK is discontinuous at sK. This is easily understood from eq. . Let us call s1 the point at which s1 with .

We stress that this discontinuity of s at sK when sK applies rigorously to sK as well since sK 2 for sK . See fig. 2 for illustration.

Chunk: precise as possible since this region gives the largest contribution to s, as it is evident from the right panel of fig.2. It happens that the K matrix of , that fits data above 0.6 GeV, is not compatible with data from Ke4 decays . We show in the insert of fig.1 the comparison of the parameterizations CGL and PY with the Ke4 data of . We also show in the same figure the experimental points on from refs. . Both refs. are compatible within errors, with some disagreement above 1.5 GeV. This disagreement does not affect our numerical results since above 1.5 GeV we do not rely on data. The K matrix of ref. is given by, Kij s i j x1 s i j x2 s ij , 8 where x1 2 .11 0.15 x1 2 .19 0.01 .28 0.08 .02 0.11 .00 0.03 .47 0.05 .86 0.15 .85 0.18 .00 0.53 , with units given in appropriate powers of GeV. In order to calculate the contribution from the phase shifts of this K matrix we generate Monte Carlo gaussian samples, taking into account the errors shown in eq. , and evaluate QH according to eq. . The central value of sK for the K matrix of ref. is 3.05, slightly below . When generating Monte Carlo gaussian samples according to eq. , there are cases with sK , around 30 of the samples. Note that for these cases one also has the contribution 6 s1 in eq. . The application of Watson final state theorem for . The first important one is the K K channel associated in turn with the appearance of the narrow f0 resonance, just on top of its threshold. This implies a sudden drop of the elasticity parameter , but it again rapidly raises the f0 resonance is narrow with a width around 30 MeV and in the region 1.12 s 1.52 GeV2 is compatible within errors with 1 . For 1, the Watson final state theorem would imply again that s s , but, as emphasized by , this equality only holds, in principle, modulo . The reason advocated in ref. is the presence of the region 1.12 GeV2 where inelasticity can be large, and then continuity arguments alone cannot be applied to guarantee the equality s s for s 1.12 GeV2. This argument has been proved in ref. to be quite irrelevant in the present case. In order to show this a diagonalization of the and K K S matrix is done. These channels are the relevant ones when is clearly different from 1, between 1 and 1.1 GeV. Above that energy one also has the opening of the channel and the increasing role of multipion states. We reproduce here the arguments of ref. , but deliver expressions directly in terms of the phase shifts and elasticity parameter, instead of K matrix parameters as done in ref. . For two channel scattering, because of unitarity, the T matrix can be written as 1 2i e2i 1 1 2 p 1 2ei K 1 2 p 1 2ei K 1 2i e2i K 1 , with K the elastic S wave K phase shift. In terms of the T matrix the S wave , , satisfying SS S . The T matrix can also be written as 1 Q1 2 , where the K matrix is real and symmetric along the real axis for s 4m2 and q , qK , with q qK the center of mass momentum of pions kaons . This allows one to diagonalize K with a real orthogonal matrix C, and hence both the T and S matrices are also diagonalized with the same matrix. Writing, cos sin sin cos , 9 one has cos 1 2 2 1 2 h 1 2 cos2 sin p 1 2 cos2 i1 2 , sin sin 2 p 1

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0040v3 math.OA 5 Sep 2008 MULTILINEAR FUNCTION SERIES IN CONDITIONALLY FREE PROBABILITY WITH AMALGAMATION MIHAI POPA Abstract. As in the cases of freeness and monotonic independence, the notion of conditional freeness is meaningful when complex valued states are replaced by positive conditional expectations. In this framework, the paper presents several positivity results, a version of the central limit theorem and an analogue of the conditionally free R transform constructed by means of multilinear function series. 1. Introduction The paper addresses a topic related to conditionally free or, shortly, using the term from , c free probability. This notion was developed in the 90 s see , as an extension of freeness within the framework of algebras endowed with not one, but two states. Namely, given a family of unital algebras i I, each Ai endowed with two expectations i, i Ai C, their c free product is the triple A, , , where i . ii i I i and i i I i are expectations given by the relations a a1 an 0 b a1 an a1 n an for all aj A j , , . . . , n such that j aj 0 and n . A key result is that if the Ai are algebras and i, i are positive functionals, then and are also positive. In , the positivity of the free product maps , is proved for the case when 1, 2 are positive conditional expectations in a common C subalgebra, but 1, 2 remain positive C valued maps. A more general situation is indeed discussed see Theorem 3, Section 6, from , but the question if , re positive for 1,2, 1,2 arbitrary positive conditional expectations is left unanswered. A first answer was given in , where we showed that for A a algebra, the analogous construction with both and valued in a C subalgebra B of A still retains the positivity. The present paper further develops this result see Theorem 2.3 and also demonstrates the use of multilinear function series in c free setting. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 45L53 Secondary 46L08. Key words and phrases. conditional freeness, conditional expectation, R transform, multi linear function series. 1 2 MIHAI POPA In is constructed a c free version of Voiculescu s R transform, which we will call the cR transform, with the property that cRX and i.e. the relations a and b from the definition of the c free product hold true for the subalgebras generated by X and Y . The apparatus of multilinear function series is used in recent work of K. Dykema and to construct suitable analogues for the R and S transforms in the framework of freeness with amalgamation. We will show that this construction is also appropriate for the cR transform mentioned above. The techniques used differ from the ones of , the Fock space type construction being substituted by combinatorial techniques similar to and . Particularly, Theorems 3.3 and 3.6 contain new shorter proves of the results 6.1 6.13 from . The paper is structured in four sections. In Section 2 are stated the basic definitions and are proved the main positivity results. Section 3 describes the construction and the basic property of the multilinear function series cR transform and Section 4 treats the central limit theorem and a related positivity property. 2. Definitions and positivity results Definition 2.1. Let i I be a family of algebras, all containing the subalgebra B. Suppose D is a subalgebra of B and i Ai D and i Ai B are con ditional expectations, i I. We say that the triple A, , i I Ai, i, i is the conditionally free product with amalgamation over B,D , or shortly, the c free product, of the triples Ai, i, i i I if A is the free product with amalgamation over B of the family Ai i I

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0041v4 math.QA 26 Oct 2007 Quantum Group of Isometries in Classical and Noncommutative Geometry by Debashish Goswami 1 Stat Math Unit, Kolkata Centre, Indian Statistical Institute 203, B. T. Road, Kolkata 700 108, India Abstract We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of Riemannian isometries for a compact Riemannian manifold, by intro ducing a natural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact quantum group on a classical or noncommutative manifold described by spectral triples, and then proving the existence of a universal object called the quantum isometry group in the category of compact quan tum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on a given possibly noncommutative manifold satisfying certain regularity assumptions. In fact, we identify the quantum isometry group with the universal ob ject in a bigger category, namely the category of quantum families of smooth isometries , defined along the line of Woronowicz and Soltan. We also construct a spectral triple on the Hilbert space of forms on a noncommutative manifold which is equivariant with respect to a nat ural unitary representation of the quantum isometry group. We give explicit description of quantum isometry groups of commutative and noncommutative tori, and in this context, obtain the quantum double torus defined in as the universal quantum group of holomorphic isometries of the noncommutative torus. 1 Introduction Since the formulation of quantum automorphism groups by Wang , , following suggestions of Alain Connes, many interesting examples of such quantum groups, particularly the quantum permutation groups of finite sets and finite graphs, have been extensively studied by a number of mathe maticians see, e.g. , , and

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0043v1 cond mat.stat mech 31 Mar 2007 Nonequilibrium entropy limiters in lattice Boltzmann methods 1 R. A. Brownlee, A. N. Gorban , J. Levesley Department of Mathematics, University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK Abstract We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice Boltz mann methods LBM . These limiters erase spurious oscillations without blurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the same work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes and finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction of nonequilibrium en tropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar quantity nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters i based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy entropy trimming and ii based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy entropy filtering . The physical properties of LBM provide some additional bene fits the control of entropy production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are possible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numeri cal examples 1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1 2 and the 2D lid driven cavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100 100 grid. All limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non entropic quasiequilibria.

Preprint submitted to Physica A 1 February 2008 we should choose between spurious oscillation in high order non monotone schemes and additional dissipation in first order schemes. Flux limiter schemes are invented to combine high resolution schemes in areas with smooth fields and first order schemes in areas with sharp gradients. The idea of flux limiters can be illustrated by computation of the flux F0,1 of the conserved quantity u between a cell marked by 0 and one of two its neighbour cells marked by 1 F0, 1 r f low 0,1 r f high 0,1 , where f low 0, 1 , f high 0, 1 are low and high resolution scheme fluxes, respectively, u0 u 1 u1 u0 , and r 0 is a flux limiter function. For r close to 1, the flux limiter function r should be also close to 1. Many flux limiter schemes have been invented during the last two decades . No particular limiter works well for all problems, and a choice is usually made on a trial and error basis. Below are several examples of flux limiter functions mm r max 0, min r, 1 minmod, os r max 0, min r, , 1 2 Osher, mc r max 0, min 2r, 0.5 1 r , 2 monotonised central sb r max 0, min 2r, 1 , min r, 2 superbee, sw r max 0, min r, 1 , r, , 1 2 Sweby, . The lattice Boltzmann method has been proposed as a discretization of Boltz mann s kinetic equation and is now in wide use in fluid dynamics and beyond for an introduction and review see . Instead of fields of moments M, the lattice Boltzmann method operates with fields of discrete distributions f. This allows us to construct very simple limiters that do not depend on slopes or gradients. All the limiters we construct are based on the representation of distributions f in the form f = f1 + f u f_smooth + f_oscillatory/ where f_smooth represents smooth oscillatory components of . Our approach is based on the nonequilibrium entropy limiters concept, introduced and developed in mathematical study of lattice Boltzmann methods. This idea was inspired by similar concepts introduced in mathematical study of finite elements methods, and by recent development of entropy condition methods in numerical methods. There are two types of limiters , based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy entropy trimming and based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy entropy filtering . These limiters are constructed in such way that they erase spurious oscillations without blurring of smooth solutions. LBM will be abbreviated with B.

These queries focus on the vortex centre data provided in the literature and the comparison between the unregularised LBGK and the median filtered coarse grid simulation, as well as the criteria used to determine when the simulation has reached a steady state. These topics are essential to understanding the results and their significance in the context of the current study.

Note, however, that these queries may require additional context from the text to fully understand. For example, the term "median filtered coarse grid simulation" might not be immediately clear to someone unfamiliar with the text, but in the context of the passage, it refers to the results of the present study, which compares the primary and secondary vortex centre data of a simulation conducted on a coarse grid with a median filter to that of a simulation using unregularised L

Chunk: F f . The standard example of the macroscopic variables are hydrodynamic fields density velocity energy density x P i 1, vi, v2 i 2 fi x . But this is not an obligatory choice. If we would like to solve, by LBM methods, the Grad equations or some extended thermodynamic equations , we should extend the list of moments but, at the same time, we should be ready to introduce more discrete velocities for a proper description of these extended moment systems . On the other hand, the athermal lattice Boltzmann models with a shortened list of macroscopic variables are very popular. The quasiequilibrium is the positive fixed point of the collision operator for the given macroscopic variables M. We assume that this point exists, is unique and depends smoothly on M. For the quasiequilibrium population vector for given M we use the notation f M, or simply f , if the correspondent value of 4 M is obvious. We use to denote the equilibration projection operation of a distribution f into the corresponding quasiequilibrium state f f m f . For some of the collision models an entropic description of equilibrium is pos sible an entropy density function S f is defined and the quasiequilibrium point f M is the entropy maximiser for given M . As a basic example we shall consider the lattice Bhatnagar Gross Krook LBGK model with overrelaxation see, e.g., . The LBGK col lision operator is F f f 2 1 f f , where . For 0, LBGK collisions do not change f, for 1 2 these collisions act as equilibration this corresponds to the Ehrenfests coarse graining further developed in , for 1, LBGK collisions act as a point reflection with the center at the quasiequilibrium f . It is shown that under some stability conditions and after an initial period of relaxation, the simplest LBGK collision with overrelaxation provides second order accurate approximation for the macroscopic transport equation with viscosity proportional to t 1 . The entropic LBGK ELBM method differs in the definition of for 1 it should conserve the entropy, and in general has the following form F f 1 f f, where 1 f f . The number f is chosen so that the constant entropy condition is satisfied S f S f . For LBGK , 2. Of course, for ELBM the entropic definition of quasiequilibrium should be valid. In the low viscosity regime, LBGK suffers from numerical instabilities which readily manifest themselves as local blow ups and spurious oscillations. The LBM experiences the same spurious oscillation problems near sharp gra dients as high order schemes do. The physical properties of the LBM schemes allows one to construct new types of limiters the nonequilibrium entropy lim iters. In general, they do the same work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes and finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction of nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to limit a scalar quantity nonequilibrium entropy and not the vectors or ten sors of spatial derivatives, as it is for flux limiters . These limiters introduce some additional dissipation, but all this dissipation could easily be evaluated through analysis of nonequilibrium entropy production. 5 Two examples of such limiters have been recently proposed the positivity rule and the Ehrenfests regularisation . The positivity rule just provides positivity of distributions if a collision step produces negative popu lations, then the positivity rule returns them to the boundary of positivity. In the Ehrenfests regularisation, one selects the k sites with highest nonequilib rium entropy the difference between entropy of the state f and entropy of the corresponding quasiequilibrium state f at a given space point that exceed a given threshold and equilibrates the state in these sites. The positivity rule and Ehrenfests regularisation provide rare, intense and localised corrections. It is easy and

Chunk: in . We understand this situation in the following way. The entropic method consists at least of three components entropic quasiequilibrium, defined by entropy maximisation 11 entropy balanced collisions that have to provide proper entropy bal ance a method for the solution of the transcendental equation S f S f to find f in . It appears that the first two items do not affect spurious oscillations at all, if we solve the equation for f with high accuracy. Additional viscosity is, potentially, added by explicit analytic formulas for f . In order not to decrease entropy, errors in these formulas always increase dissipation. This can be interpreted as a hidden transformation of the form , where the coefficients in depend also on f . 3.8 Monotonic and double monotonic limiters Two monotonicity properties are important in the theory of nonequilibrium entropy limiters a limiter should move the distribution to equilibrium in all cases of 0 1. This is the dissipativity condition which means that limiters never produce negative entropy. a limiter should not change the order of states on the line if for two distributions with the same moments, f and f , S f S f before the limiter transformation, then the same inequality should hold after the limiter transformation too. For example, for the limiter it means that S f x S f x f f f f is a monotonically increasing function of . In quadratic approximation, S f x f f x2 S f , S f x S f x f f f f x2 2 x2 S f , and the second monotonicity condition transforms into the following require ment y y2s is a monotonically increasing not decreasing function of 0. If a limiter satisfies both monotonicity conditions, we call it double mono tonic . For example, Ehrenfests regularisation satisfies the first monotonicity condition, but obviously violates the second one. The limiter violates the first condition for small S, but is dissipative and satisfies the second one in quadratic approximation for large S. The limiter with 1 1 Sk al ways satisfies the first monotonicity condition, violates the second if , and is double monotonic in quadratic approximation for the second condi tion , if . The threshold limiters are also double monotonic. 12 Of course, it is not forbidden to use any type of limiters under the local and global control of dissipation, but double monotonic limiters provide some nat ural properties automatically, without additional care. 4 Numerical experiment To conclude this paper we report some numerical experiments conducted to demonstrate the performance of some of the proposed nonequilibrium entropy limiters for LBM from Sec. 3. 4.1 Velocities and quasiequilibria We will perform simulations using both entropic and non entropic quasiequi libria, but we always work with an athermal LBM model. Whenever we use non entropic quasiequilibria we employ Kullback entropy . In 1D, we use a lattice with spacing and time step so that the model consists of static, left and right moving populations only. The subscript i denotes population not lattice site number and f1, f2 and f3 denote the static, left and right moving populations, respectively. The entropy is , with f1 4 f2 log f2 f3 log f3 , see, e.g., and, for this entropy, the local entropic quasiequilibrium state f is available explicitly f 3 2 1 3u2 , f 6 3u 1 2 1 3u2 , f 6 3u 1 2 1 3u2 , where X i fi, u 1 X i vifi. 13 The standard non entropic polynomial quasiequilibria are f 3 1 3u2 2 ! , f 6 1 3u 3u2 , f 6 1 3u 3u2 .

For this limiter, we will fix so that the limiter is double monotonic in quadratic approximation to entropy and compare the density profiles for E S k , 0.1, 0.01, 0.001. We have also ensured an ensemble dependent limiter because of the dependence of on the average E S . As with Fig. 2, we accompany each panel with the total entropy and nonequilibrium entropy histories. Note the different scales for nonequilibrium entropy. Note also that entropy necessarily now grows due to the additional dissipation. Our next example Fig. 5 considers the threshold filter . In this example we choose the estimates S , 10E S , 20E S and fix the tol erance 0 so that the influence of the threshold alone can be studied. Only entropic adjustments are accepted in the limiter St S. As the threshold increases, nonequilibrium entropy grows faster and spurious begin to appear. Finally, we test the median filter Fig. 6 .

A. SCHEKOCHIHIN,1,2 S. C. COWLEY,2,3 W. DORLAND,4 G. W. HAMMETT,5 G. G. HOWES,6 E. QUATAERT,7 AND T. TATSUNO4 Submitted April 1, 2007 accepted February 21, 2009 published May 6, 2009 ABSTRACT This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding plasma turbulence in astrophysical plasmas. It is motivated by observations of electromagnetic and density fluctuations in the solar wind, interstellar medium and galaxy clusters, as well as by models of particle heating in accretion disks. All of these plasmas and many others have turbulent motions at weakly collisional and collisionless scales. The paper focuses on turbulence in a strong mean magnetic field. The key assumptions are that the turbulent fluctuations are small compared to the mean field, spatially anisotropic with respect to it and that their frequency is low compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. The turbulence is assumed to be forced at some system specific outer scale. The energy injected at this scale has to be dissipated into heat, which ultimately cannot be accomplished without collisions. A kinetic cascade develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and velocity. The nature of the kinetic cascade in various scale ranges depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations that exist there. There are four special scales that separate physically distinct regimes the electron and ion gyroscales, the mean free path and the electron diffusion scale. In each of the scale ranges separated by these scales, the fully kinetic problem is systematically reduced to a more physically transparent and computationally tractable system of equations, which are derived in a rigorous way. In the inertial range above the ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade separates into two parts a cascade of Alfve nic fluctuations and a passive cascade of density and magnetic field strength fluctuations. The former are governed by the Reduced Magnetohydrodynamic RMHD equations at both the collisional and collisionless scales the latter obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated with the Alfve nic component in the collisional limit, these compressive fluctuations become the slow and entropy modes of the conventional MHD . In the dissipation range below ion gyroscale, there are again two cascades the kinetic Alfve n wave KAW cascade governed by two fluid like Electron Reduced Magnetohydrodynamic ERMHD equations and a passive cascade of ion entropy fluctuations both in space and velocity. The latter cascade brings the energy of the inertial range fluctuations that was Landau damped at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov style scaling relations are derived for all of these cascades. The relationship between the theoretical models proposed in this paper and astrophysical applications and observations is discussed in detail. Subject headings magnetic fields methods analytical MHD plasmas turbulence 1. INTRODUCTION As observations of velocity, density and magnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas probe ever smaller scales, turbulence i.e., broadband disordered fluctuations usually characterized by power law energy spectra emerges as a fundamental and ubiquitous feature. One of the earliest examples of observed turbulence in space was the detection of a Kolmogorov k 5 3 spectrum of magnetic fluctuations in the solar wind over a fre quency range of about three decades first reported by Matthaeus Goldstein 1982 Bavassano et al. 1984 and Bavassano Matthaeus 1998. This finding was extended to other plasma, both in interstellar medium Cowie McKee 1989 Vainio Cowie 1997 and galaxy clusters Govoni Feretti 2004. These turbulent motions have been observed over many orders of magnitude in spatial and temporal scales, from thousands of kilometers and hours down to kilometers and seconds in the solar wind, from light years and million years in galaxy clusters to parsec and thousands of years in the interstellar medium. The plasmas where these motions take place, e.g., the solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters and accretion disks, are usually very weakly collisional or collisionless. This feature poses a challenge to theoretical understanding of the turbulence in these plasmas by, for example, restricting conventional fluid turbulence models to very short temporal and spatial scales. Although particle collision frequency is low or zero, some processes similar to collisional energy dissipation are present in some form. For example, in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, there are Landau damping, phase

An other famous example in which the Kolmogorov power law appears to hold is the electron density spectrum in the inter stellar medium ISM in this case it emerges from observa tions by various methods in several scale intervals and, when these are pieced together, the power law famously extends over as many as 12 decades of scales Armstrong et al. 1981, 1995 Lazio et al. 2004 , a record that has earned it the name of the Great Power Law in the Sky. Numerous other mea surements in space and astrophysical plasmas, from the mag netosphere to galaxy clusters, result in Kolmogorov or con sistent with Kolmogorov spectra but also show steeper power laws at very small microphysical scales these observations are discussed in more detail in 8 . Power law spectra spanning broad bands of scales are symptomatic of the fundamental role of turbulence as a mech anism of transferring energy from the outer scale s hence forth denoted L , where the energy is injected to the inner scale s , where it is dissipated. As these scales tend to be widely separated in astrophysical systems, one way for the system to bridge this scale gap is to fill it with fluctuations the power law spectra then arise due to scale invariance at the in termediate scales. Besides being one of the more easily mea surable characteristics of the multi scale nature of turbulence, 2 SCHEKOCHIHIN ET AL. power law and, particularly, Kolmogorov spectra evoke a number of fundamental physical ideas that lie at the heart of the turbulence theory universality of small scale physics, en ergy cascade, locality of interactions, etc. In this paper, we shall revisit and generalize these ideas for the problem of ki netic plasma turbulence,8 so it is perhaps useful to remind the reader how they emerge in a standard argument that leads to the k 5 3 spectrum Kolmogorov 1941 Obukhov 1941 . 1.1. Kolmogorov Turbulence Suppose the average energy per unit time per unit volume that the system dissipates is . This energy has to be trans ferred from some large outer scale L at which it is injected to some small inner scale s at which the dissipation occurs see 1.5 . It is assumed that in the range of scales interme diate between the outer and the inner the inertial range , the statistical properties of the turbulence are universal indepen dent of the macrophysics of injection or of the microphysics of dissipation , spatially homogeneous and isotropic and the energy transfer is local in scale space. The flux of kinetic en ergy through any inertial range scale is independent of u2 const, where the constant density of the medium is absorbed into , u is the typical velocity fluctuation associated with the scale , and is the cascade time.9 Since interactions are assumed local, must be expressed in terms of quantities associated with scale . It is then dimensionally inevitable that u the nonlinear interaction time, or turnover time , so we get u 1 3. This corresponds to a k 5 3 spectrum of kinetic energy. 1.2. MHD Turbulence and Critical Balance That astronomical data appear to point to a ubiquitous na ture of what, in its origin, is a dimensional result for the turbu lence in a neutral fluid, might appear surprising. Indeed, the astrophysical plasmas in question are highly conducting and support magnetic fields whose energy is at least comparable to the kinetic

We note here that, again with , equation implies conservation of and the averaged wave action flux , which, together with , also yield . The physical frequency and wavenumber in the modulated periodic wave under study are given by the formula , and we recall here that L is constant see . As discussed before at the end of Section 3 we must require that the phase speed stays positive as the wave evolves, and here that requires that the physical wavenumber 0. Since a h and hence hV 6g is supposed to be small within the range of applicability of the KdV equation the expression implies the behaviour gh which of course agrees with the well known result for linear waves on a sloping beach see Johnson 1997 for instance . This effect will be slightly attenuated for the nonlinear cnoidal wave, since V h , but the overall effect will be a squeezing of the cnoidal wave, a result important for our further study of undular bores. Next we study numerically the combined effect of slope and friction on a cnoidal wave. As we have shown, in the presence of Chezy friction M 0, and we have also assumed that , which is necessary when we come to study undular bores. Now we use the stationary modulation system in Riemann variables, which was derived using this as sumption. We solve the coupled ordinary differential equation system for the case of a linear slope h x h0 x with , 0.01, and with the initial conditions .441, .147, .294 at , which corresponds to a nearly harmonic wave with .2, a .2, h0 0.3 at see . Also we note that for the chosen parameters we have , so at gh0 as in linear theory. It is instructive to compare solutions with .01 and without friction.

We see that for the frictionless case m 1 with decrease of depth, i.e. the wave crests assume the shape of solitary waves when one approaches the shoreline. When CD 0 the modulus also grows with decrease of depth but never reaches unity. The dependence on x of the mean surface elevation for the cases without and with friction is shown in Fig. 3. We have checked that the wavelength L is constant for both solutions. Also, one can see from Fig. 3 right that the value h1 4 d is indeed conserved in the frictionless case but is not constant if friction is present the same holds true for the value h1 2 but we do not present the graph here . Finally, in Fig. 4 the dependence of the physical elevation wave amplitude a on the spatial coordinate x is shown. One can see that the amplitude adiabatically grows with distance in the frictionless case due to the effect of the slope without friction but, not unexpectedly, gradually decreases in the case

Chunk: when bottom friction is present, where the decrease for these parameter settings is comparable in magnitude to the effect of the slope. In both cases the main qualitative 17 changes occur in the wave shape and the wavelength. Overall, we can infer from these results that the main local effect of a slope and bottom friction on a cnoidal wave, along with the adiabatic amplitude variations, is twofold a wave with a 0 tends to transform into a sequence of solitary waves as x decreases, and at the same time the distance between subsequent wave crests tends to decrease. This is in sharp contrast with the behaviour of modulated cnoidal waves in problems described by the unperturbed KdV equation, where growth of the modulus m is accompanied by an increase of the distance between the wave crests. Generally, in the study of behaviour of unsteady undular bores in the presence of a slope and bottom friction we will have to deal with the combination of these two opposite tendencies. 6 Undular bore propagation over variable topography with bottom friction 6.1 Gurevich Pitaevskii problem for flat bottom zero friction case We now turn to the problem b outlined in Section 2. We study the evolution of an undular bore developing from an initial surface elevation , located at some point . As discussed below, the undular bore will expand with time so that at some , which begins at see Fig. 1b . We assume that for . We shall first present a formulation of the Gurevich Pitaevskii problem for the perturbation free KdV equation and reproduce the well known similarity modulation solution describing the evolution of the undular bore until the moment it enters the slope. We emphasize that, although this formulation and, especially, this similarity solution are known very well and have been used by many authors, some of the inferences important for the present application to fluid dynamics have not been widely appreciated, as far as we can discern. Pertinent to our main objective in this paper, we undertake a detailed study of the characteristics of the Whitham modulation system in the vicinity of the leading edge of the undular bore solution, and show that the boundary con ditions of Gurevich Pitaevskii type permit only two possible characteristics configurations, implying two qualitatively different types of the leading solitary wave behaviour. Next, we shall show how this Gurevich Pitaevskii formulation of the problem applies to the perturbed modulation system in the form and finally we will study the effects of the perturbation on the modulations in the vicinity of the leading edge of the undular bore. In the case of a flat, frictionless bottom the original equation becomes the constant coefficient KdV equation which can be cast into the standard form 6 0 by introducing the new variables 2 3h0 A , 3 2h0 x x0 p gh0t , 9 16 r g h0 t , where . In the Gurevich Pitaevskii GP approach, one considers a large scale initial disturbance , 0 f , in the form of a decreasing profile, 18 f 0 e.g. a smooth step f 0 as f , whose initial evolution until some critical breaking time b can be described by the dispersionless limit of the KdV equation, i.e. by the Hopf equation, b r , , r 6rr 0 , r , 0 f . The evolution leads to wave breaking of the r profile at some b, with the consequence that the dispersive term in the KdV equation then comes into play, and an undular bore forms, which can be locally represented as a single phase travelling wave. This travelling wave is modulated in such a way that it acquires the form of a solitary wave at the leading edge and gradually degenerates, via the nonlinear cnoidal wave regime, to a linear wave packet at the trailing edge .

Chunk: we assume in this section , . First, as we have already mentioned, the characteristic family 2 d d v2 is an expansion fan in the , plane, 2 C2 , parameterised by a constant C2, 6 C2 4 . Next, in we make an asymptotic expansion of v2 1, m, 0 for small 1 m 1, to get 2 1 m ln 16 1 m or, with logarithmic accuracy, 1 1 m 2 ln 1 . Next, expanding v1 1, m, 0 for 1 m 1 and using we get the asymptotic equation for the characteristics family 1, d d O 1 m , which is readily integrated to leading order to give 1 C1 , where C1 0 is an arbitrary constant labeling the characteristics . This asymptotic formula is valid as long as 1. The behaviour of the characteristics belonging to the families 1 and 2 near the leading edge is shown in Fig. 6a. Next, expanding the equation for the third characteristic family, 3 d d v3 1, m, 0 for 1 m 1, we get on using d d ln 1 O . 22 2 W 1 a W 3 b 0 d d Figure 6 Characteristics behaviour for the similarity modulation solution near the leading edge a families 1 d d v1 and 2 C2 , b family 3 d d v3. Integrating we obtain to first order 3 C3 g , where g Z 1 C3 ln C3 ln d , g C3 0 , C3 being an arbitrary constant. The asymptotic formula is valid as long as g C3 1. Since the characteristics 3 intersect the leading edge we must indicate their behaviour outside the undular bore. It follows from the matching condition and the limiting structure of the characteristic velocities of the Whitham system, that the characteristics from the family 3 match with the Hopf equation characteristics d d 6r carrying the value of the Riemann invariant . Therefore, the sought external characteristics are simply vertical lines C3. The qualitative behaviour of the characteristics from the family 3 is shown in Fig. 6b. It is clear from the asymptotic behaviour of the characteristics that the edge characteristic corresponding to the motion of the leading solitary wave intersects only with characteristics of the family 3 carrying the Riemann invariant value . Since, according to the matching condition , r3 0 everywhere along the edge characteristic one can infer that the leading solitary wave motion is completely specified by its amplitude at 0. Indeed, in this case, the leading edge represents a genuine multiple characteristic of the modulation system, along which the Riemann invariant r . Given the constant value of , one infers that the amplitude of the lead soliton of the self similar undular bore, r3 r 2 is also a constant value. Thus, in the undular bore evolving from an initial jump, the leading solitary wave represents an independent soliton of the KdV equation. Of course, this fact follows directly from the modulation solution but now we have established its meaning in the context of the characteristics, which will play an important role below. Next we discuss the structure of the undular bore front in the case when the initial profile , 0 is not a simple jump discontinuity, and instead has the form of a monotonically decreasing function, for instance, 1 2 when 0 and , 0 0 for 0. In that case, the modulation solution for the undular bore no longer possesses x t similarity as in the 23 2 d v d 1 d v d a 1r 3r 2r b Figure 7 a Leading edge of non self similar undular bore as an envelope of pairwise merging characteristics from the families d d v1 and d d v2 b behaviour of the Riemann invariants in non self similar modulation solution with r3 0. jump resolution case

Chunk: perturbation analysis. The well known example of such a behaviour, when a solitary wave is constrained by the condition of being a part of a global nonlinear wave structure, is provided by the undular bore solution of the KdV Burgers KdV B equation ut 6uux uxx, 1 . 4 h x x 0 a h x x 0 b Figure 1 Isolated solitary wave a and undular bore b entering the variable topogra phy bottom friction region. Indeed, the undular bore solution of the KdV B equation is known to have a solitary wave at its leading edge see Johnson 1970 Gurevich Pitaevskii 1987 Avilov, Krichever Novikov 1987 and this solitary wave a is asymptotically close to a soliton solution of the unperturbed KdV equation and b has the amplitude, say a0, that is constant in time. At the same time, it is clear that if one takes an isolated KdV soliton of the same amplitude a0 as initial data for the KdV Burgers equation it would damp with time due to dissipation. The physical explanation of such a drastic difference in the behaviour of an isolated soliton and a lead solitary wave in the undular bore for the same weakly dissipative KdV B equation is that the action of weak dissipation on an expanding undular bore is twofold on the one hand, the dissipation tends to decrease the amplitude of the wave locally but, on the other hand, it squeezes the undular bore so that the interaction i.e. momentum exchange between separate solitons within the bore becomes stronger than in the absence of dissipation and this acts as the amplitude increasing factor. The additional momentum is extracted from the upstream flow with a greater depth see Benjamin and Lighthill 1954 . As a result, in the case of the KdV B equation, an equilibrium non zero value for the lead solitary wave amplitude in the undular bore is established. Of course, for other types of dissipation, a stationary value of the lead soliton amplitude would not necessarily exist, but in general, due to the expected increase of the soliton interactions near the leading edge, the amplitude of the lead soliton of the undular bore would decay slower than that of an isolated soliton. Indeed, the presence here of variable topography as well can result in an additional nonlocal amplitude growth. While the problem a can be solved using traditional perturbation analysis for a single solitary wave, which leads to an ordinary differential equation along the solitary wave path see Miles 1983a,b , the undular bore evolution problem b requires a more general approach which can be developed on the basis of Whitham s modulation theory leading to a system of three nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations of the first order. Since the Whitham 5 method, being equivalent to a nonlinear multiple scale perturbation procedure, contains the adiabatic theory of slow evolution of a single solitary wave as a particular albeit singular limit, it is instructive for the purposes of this paper to treat both problems a and b using the general Whitham theory. 3 Modulation equations The original Whitham method Whitham 1965, 1974 was developed for conservative constant coefficient nonlinear dispersive equations and is based on the averaging of appropriate con servation laws of the original system over the period of a single phase periodic travelling wave solution. The resulting system of quasi linear equations describes the slow evolution of the modulations i.e. of the mean value, the wavenumber, the amplitude etc. of the pe riodic travelling wave. Here, that approach is extended to the perturbed KdV equation following the general approach of Kamchatnov , which extends earlier results for cer tain specific cases see Gurevich and Pitaevskii 1987, 1991 , Avilov, Krichever and Novikov and Myint and Grimshaw for instance . We suppose that the evolution of the nonlinear wave is adiabatically slow, that is, the wave can

Chunk: be locally represented as a solution of the corresponding unperturbed KdV equation i.e. with zero on the right hand side with its parameters slowly varying with space and time. The one phase periodic solution of the KdV equation can be written in the form U X, T 3 1 2 2 3 2 sn2 p 3 1 , m where sn y, m is the Jacobi elliptic sine function, 1 2 3 are parameters and the phase variable and the modulus m are given by X V T, 1 2 3 , 3 2 3 1 , and Z 3 2 d p P 2K m 3 1 , where K m is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, L is the wavelength along the X axis which is actually a retarded time rather than a true spatial co ordinate . Here we have used the representation of the basic ordinary differential equation for the KdV travelling wave solution in the form see Kamchatnov for a general motivation behind this representation d d 2 p P , where 1 2 U s1 , 1 2 3 and P 3 Y i 3 s1 2 s2 s3, 6 that is the solution is parameterized by the zeroes 1, 2, 3 of the polynomial P . In a modulated wave, the parameters 1, 2, 3 are allowed to be slow functions of X and T, and their evolution is governed by the Whitham equations. For the unperturbed KdV equation, the evolution of the modulation parameters is due to a spatial non uniformity of the initial distributions for j, , 2, 3 and the typical spatio temporal scale of the modulation variations is determined by the scale of the initial data. In the case of the perturbed KdV equation , the evolution of the parameters 1, 2, 3 is caused not only by their initial spatial non uniformity, but also by the action of the weak perturbation, so that, generally, at least two independent spatio temporal scales for the modulations can be involved. However, at this point we shall not introduce any scale separation within the modulation theory and derive general perturbed Whitham equations assuming that the typical values of F T and G T are O j T, j X within the modulation theory. It is instructive to first introduce the Whitham equations for the perturbed KdV equation using the traditional approach of averaging the perturbed conservation laws. To this end, we introduce the averaging over the period of the cnoidal wave 1 L Z 3 2 Fd p P . In particular, 2 3 1 E m K m 1 2 3, 8 s1 6 3 1 E m K m 1 3s1 1 1 6 2 1 2 3 s2 1 , where E m is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind. Now, one represents the KdV equation in the form of the perturbed conservation laws Pj T Qj , , 2, 3 , Rj 1 , where Pj and Qj are the standard expressions for the conserved densities Kruskal integrals and fluxes of the unperturbed KdV equation. Just as in the Whitham theory for unperturbed dispersive systems, the number of conservation laws required is equal to the number of free parameters in the travelling wave solution, which is three in the present case. Next, one applies the averaging to the system to obtain see Dubrovin and Novikov 1989 T , , 2, 3 . The system describes slow evolution of the parameters j in the cnoidal wave solution . Along with these derived perturbed conservative form of the Whitham equations, we introduce the wave conservation law which is a general condition for the existence of slowly modulated single phase travelling wave solutions see for instance Whitham 1974 and must be consistent with the modulation system .

Chunk: 1 , 4 1 2 3 are the solitary wave amplitude and velocity respectively. The solution depends on two parameters 1 and 3 whose adiabatic slow evolution is governed by the reduced modulation system . It is important that the second equation in this system is decoupled from the first one. Hence, evolution of the pedestal 3 on which the solitary wave rides, can be found from the solution of this dispersionless equation by the method of characteristics. When 3 X, T is known, evolution of the parameter 1 can be found from the solution of the first equation . As a result, we arrive at a complete description of adiabatic slow evolution of the solitary wave parameters taking account of its interaction with the given pedestal. However, it is important to note here that while this description of the adiabatic evolution of a solitary wave is complete as far as the solitary wave itself is concerned, it fails to describe the evolution of a trailing shelf, which is needed to conserve total mass see, for instance, Johnson 1973b, Grimshaw 1979 or Grimshaw 2006 . This trailing shelf has a very small amplitude, but a very large length scale, and hence can carry the same order of mass as the solitary wave. But note that the momentum of the trailing shelf is much smaller than that of the solitary wave, whose adiabatic deformation is in fact governed to leading order by conservation of momentum , or more precisely, by conservation of wave action flux strictly speaking, conservation only in the absence of friction . The situation simplifies if the solitary wave propagates into a region of still water so that there is no pedestal ahead of the wave, that is T . But then, since , we can put , U X, T 2 1sech2 p 1 X VsT , 1, and in equation for the parameter 1 to obtain, 1 T 4 1 1 1 32 15G 2 1 , 11 As we see, the solitary wave moves with the instant velocity dX 1, and the parameter 1 changes with T along the solitary wave trajectory according to the ordinary differential equation d 1 T 1 32 15G T 2 1. It can be shown that equation is consistent with the equation for the solitary wave half width 1 obtained by the traditional perturbation approach see Grimshaw for instance . Next, we re write equation in terms the original independent x variable. For that, we find from , that h1 2 6g3 2 dx and g h 3 2 dh dx, g h 1 2 . Then substituting these expressions into yields the equation d 1 1 64 45 CD g 2 1 which can be easily integrated to give 1 C0 64 45 CD g Z x 0 dx h3 , where C0 is an integration constant and h0. According to , 1 is the amplitude of the soliton expressed in terms of variable U X, T . Returning to the original surface displacement A x, t by means of and denoting 3ga0h0 , we find the dependence of the surface elevation soliton amplitude 2h2 3g U0 on x in the form h0 h 1 16 15CDa0h0 Z x 0 dx h3 1 , where a0 is the solitary wave amplitude at . We note that for , while for 1 constant x due to Chezy friction. Miles 1983a,b obtained this expression for a linear depth variation, although we note that there is a factor of 2 difference from in Miles 1983a,b the factor 16CD 15 is 8CD 15 . The trajectory of the soliton can be now found from and a0h0 2 g Z x 0 dx h 5 2 x 1 16 15CDa0h0 Z x 0 dx h3 x 1 . This expression determines implicitly the dependence of x on t along the solitary wave path

Chunk: and provides the desired equation for the multiple characteristic of the modulation system for the case . 12 It is instructive to derive an explicit expression for the solitary wave speed by computing the derivative dx dt from , or more simply, directly from , c 1 a 2h . The formula yields the restriction for the relative amplitude a wave breaking occurs already at 0.7 see Whitham 1974 . In the frictionless case equation gives a , and so the expression for the speed must fail as h 0. It is interesting to note that this failure of the KdV model as h 0 due to appearance of infinite and further negative! solitary wave speeds is not apparent from the expression for the solitary wave amplitude, and the implication is that the model cannot be continued as h 0. Curiously this restriction of the KdV model seems never to have been noticed before in spite of numerous works on this subject. Note that taking account of bottom friction leads to a more complicated formula for the solitary wave speed as a function of h but the qualitative result remains the same. It is straightforward to show from or that ax 1 16 15CDa0h0 Z x 0 dx h3 1 . It follows immediately that for a wave advancing into increasing depth , the ampli tude decreases due to a combination of increasing depth and bottom friction. However, for a wave advancing into decreasing depth, there is a tendency to increase the amplitude due to the depth decrease, but to decrease the amplitude due to bottom friction. Hence whether or not the amplitude increases is determined by which of these effects is larger, and this in turn is determined by the slope, the depth, and the consolidated drag parameter CDa0 h0. To illustrate, let us consider the bottom topography in the form h x h1 0 h0 x , 0 , which satisfies the condition the parameter characterizes the slope of the bot tom. In this case the formula becomes h0 h 1 16 15 CDa0 3 1 h0 h0 h 3 1 1 1 if 1 3. One can see now that if 1 3, then the bottom friction term is relatively unimportant due to the smallness of CD. Of course, for this case we again recover the Boussinesq result, now slightly modified, a a0 h0 h 1 16 15 CDa0 1 3 h2 0 1 , 1 3, h h0. Of course, this result is impractical in the KdV context as the KdV approximation used here requires the ratio a h to remain small. 13 If 1 3 now obtain asymptotic formula a 15 3 1 16CD h0 h0 h 1 2 , h h0 , which is independent of the initial amplitude a0. This expression is consistent with the small amplitude KdV approximation as long as 3 1 CD is order unity. Simple inspection of shows that the solitary wave amplitude increases as h 0 if 1 1 2, is constant as h 0 if 1 2, decreases as h 0 if 1 2. Thus for 1 1 2, as for the case 1 3, the amplitude will increase as the depth decreases, in spite of the presence of sufficiently small friction. However, for 1 3, even although there is usually some initial growth in the amplitude, eventually even small bottom friction will take effect and the amplitude decreases to zero. We note that if 1 3 then the integral R x 0 h 3dx in diverges logarithmically as h 0, which just slightly modifies the result for h h0 and implies growth of the amplitude ln h h as h 0. Of particular interest is the case 1. In that case formula becomes h0 h 1 8 15 CDa0 h0 h0 h 2 1 1 . and a 15 8 CD h , h h0 These

Chunk: 1 i almost surely. Since X1 Xn n is uniformly bounded, the Lebesgue bounded convergence theorem implies that Qn l X i as n . 5 In the regular case Pl , Qn 0 and all non zero eigenvalues are in group A. Hence we have S Rn n 1 S S l X i log i l X i log i Qn and the statement is clear. Next we consider the singular case, when we have X A n 1 S O , and we turn to eigenvalues in B. If the eigenvalue corresponding to i1, . . ., in n is in group B and , then the eigenvalue is 1 n d i2 . . . in. It follows that X i2,...,in d i2 in n log d i2 in n d n X i2,...,in i2 in log i2 in d n log d d n n 1 S d n log d n . When , . . . , , we get the same quantity, so this should be multiplied with n X B d n 1 S d log d n . We make a lower estimate to the entropy of Rn in such a way that we compute P when runs over A and B. It is clear now that S Rn n 1 S S X A X B n 1 S S d n 1 S d log n O as n . 3 Interpretation as capacity A classical quantum channel with classical input alphabet X transfers the input x X into the output W x x which is a density matrix acting on a Hilbert space K. We restrict ourselves to the case when X is finite and K is finite dimensional. 6 If a classical random variable X is chosen to be the input, with probability distribution , then the corresponding output is the quantum state X P x X p x x. When a measurement is performed on the output quantum system, it gives rise to an output random variable Y which is jointly distributed with the input X. If a partition of unity in B K describes the measurement, then Prob Tr xFy x, y X . According to the Holevo bound, we have I X Y H Y H Y X I X, W S X X x X p x S x , which is actually a simple consequence of the monotonicity of the relative entropy un der state transformation , see also . I X, W is the so called Holevo quantity or classical quantum mutual information, and it satisfies the identity X x X p x S x I X, W S X , where is an arbitrary density. The channel is used to transfer sequences from the classical alphabet x1, x2, . . . , xn X n is transferred into the quantum state W n x x x1 x2 . . . xn. A code for the channel W n is defined by a subset An X n, which is called a codeword set. The de coder is a measurement . The probability of error is Prob X Y , where X is the input random variable uniformly distributed on An and the output random variable is determined by , where x and y are replaced by x and y. The essential observation is the fact that S Rn n 1 S S in the conjecture is a Holevo quantity in case of a channel with input sequences x1, x2, . . . , xn n and outputs x1 x2 . . . xn, where , and the codewords are all sequences containing exactly one 0. More generally, we shall consider Holevo quantities I A, 0, 1 S 1 A X x A x 1 A X x A S x . defined for any set A n of binary sequences

Chunk: a new approach in acoustic emission testing, and is a very promising method for aircraft and airspace structural testing. When preparing the experiments, we focused on locating evolving defects in stressed materials and constructions, and leakage of vessels. We therefore performed location exper iments on four different specimens with three different AE sources. The specimens comprised bands, plates, rings, and vessels, while the AE sources were simulated by rupture of a pencil lead pen test , material deformation during tensile test, and leakage air flow through a small hole in a sample. The positions of AE sources used in testing were well specified. Actual positions were compared with estimated ones, and the discrepancy was used to describe the inaccuracy of the locator. In this article, only the experiment with leakage air flow through a small hole in a sample is explained. In Part I, location of one continuous AE source is explained. This Part is intended for better understanding of Part II and comparison of results. In Part II, a new approach to the location of two 2 simultaneously active continuous AE sources is explained. Below, the article first explains the theoretical background for application of the conditional average to the location problem, then describes auxiliary AE signal processing, and finally demonstrates performance of the experimental intelli gent locator. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND In this section we describe a non parametric approach to empirical modeling of AE phenomena and solving the location problem. This modeling stems from a description of physical laws in terms of probability distributions. Since it has been explained in detail elsewhere, we present here just its basic concepts , . The object of empirical modeling is the relationship between variables which are simultaneously measured by a set of sensors. In our example the variables are source coordinates and AE signal characteristics. Let them be represented by a vector of M components 1, . . . , M . In the empirical description of an AE phenomenon we repeat the observation N times to create a database of prototype vectors . Instead of formulating a relation between the components of x we instead treat this vector as a random variable and express the joint probability density function f by the estimator f x 1 N N X x xn . Here denotes Dirac s delta function. For the purposes of modelling, we must also estimate the probability density in the space between the prototype points. This is achieved by expressing the singular delta function in Eqs. 1 by a smooth function, such as for example the Gaussian wn x xn, exp x xn 2 2 2 , , . . . , N . in which denotes the smoothing parameter. The data vectors determine an empirical model of the probability density function. Their acquisition corresponds to the learning phase of the empirical modeling. Let us further assume that observation of AE phenomenon provides only partial information that is given by a truncated vector 1, . . . , S , in which denotes missing components. The problem is to estimate the complementary vector of missing or hidden components S 1, . . . , M such that the complete data vector is determined by concate nation 1, . . . , S, S 1, . . . , M . A statistically optimal solution to this problem is determined by the conditional average estimator, which is expressed by a superposition of terms 1 Bn g hn, where Bn g w g gn, PN g gk, . The basis functions Bn g represent a measure of similarity between the truncated vector g given by a particular ob servation and truncated vectors from the database gn. The higher the value of Bn g the higher the contribution of hn to the sum 7 estimating h. Hence, estimation of the hidden vector h resembles associative recall, which is characteristic of intelligence. The

Chunk: by specimen rupture during the tensile test, and discrete AE on pressure vessel. Is has been also shown that the locator can perform zonal locating . Comparing mean errors of all experiments and the distances between prototype sources, we find that the average error is always less than 30 of the distance between prototype sources, while the maximal error is always less than 50 of the distance between prototype sources. The accuracy of the locator can be controlled by the number of prototype sources excited during training. The experimental error of the locator is a consequence of wave dispersion on a specimen that operates as a waveguide, reflections from boundaries, and attenuation. We found for dispersive waves that an optimal wave packet must be found which has approximately constant velocity along the test specimen. Estimation of time delay between AE signals by the cross correlation function is only applicable for one active AE source. If there are several simultaneously active AE sources, then blind source separation should be used, as will be shown in Part II.
###
Queries:
1. How does specimen rupture during tensile test and AE on pressure vessels relate to zonal locating?
2. What is the acceptable average and maximum error for locator accuracy in experiments with prototype sources?
3. How does the accuracy of the locator depend on the number of prototype sources excited during training?

Note: The text does not provide specific information on the topic asked in the query #3. As such, a query asking for a direct relationship between locator accuracy and the number of prototype sources cannot be formulated. The search query should rather focus on understanding how locator accuracy and the number of prototype sources are generally related, within the context of acoustic emission testing or related practices. Therefore, a better query would be, "How does the accuracy of the locator depend on the data collected from the prototype sources during the experiments or practices?"

This formatted list should provide enough context for a user to search and understand the main points discussed in the given academic chunk.

Chunk: density distribution. The sampler was started from the parameter set which triggered the highest value of 2F in our grid based coherent run of the analysis see former section . The automated function of the Metropolis sampling is achieved by controlling the sampling step size with adaptive acceptance probability techniques . The sampler therefore does not depend on assumptions about the signal in the data set in order to perform successfully and reliably it develops a suitable algorithm and approach by itself based on the properties of the likelihood as found on the fly, in the initial steps of the sampler. The length of our Markov chain was pre set to 106, with the initial 104 chain states discarded as the burn in phase of our sampler. The runtime for one data analysis run is 5 hours on a single 2 GHz CPU on the Tsunami cluster of the University of Birmingham. WD MLDC1 6 Figure 2.

Results We found that the most promising candidate signal from the F statistic search already matched the true embedded signal to high accuracy, particularly in frequency and sky location. Our MCMC sampler, as a post processing unit, thus only needed 1000 iterations to burn in and to establish a reliable sampling from the posterior. The marginalised posteriors are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. We found, as seen in latter figures, that the MCMC sampler further refined the initial guesses from the F statistic, as measured by the absolute difference between the true value of a given parameter and the median of the marginalised posterior recovered for that parameter.

Nevertheless we note that WD MLDC1 9 our run on Challenge 1.1.1a shows a lower match and higher differences between true value and recovered value of parameters as compared to the run on Challenge 1.1.1b. It also exhibits tailing posterior distributions in inclination and amplitude, although the SNR of Challenge 1.1.1a is twice the value of Challenge 1.1.1b. 4. Conclusions We have presented a new approach to LISA data analysis in the form of an end to end pipeline. We first detected and identified candidate signals in the LISA data stream with a grid based coherent algorithm, and then post processed the most promising candidate signals with an automatic Markov Chain Monte Carlo code to obtain probability densities for the model s parameters. We demonstrated successful identification and post processing of the signals from the double white dwarf single source MLDC1 as presented in Challenge 1.1.1a, showing that differences between the true values and the recovered values of the parameters are within the uncertainties resulting from the pipeline. Our results suggest that the method presented here can be extended to a fully automated pipeline for processing LISA data in the frequency range of interest.

Chunk: section 4 . The SFP algorithm described in section 5 goes through certain finite subsets of Wd in increasing order, and outputs smooth Fano d polytopes in increasing order, such that any smooth Fano d polytope is isomorphic to exactly one in the output list. As a consequence of the total order on smooth Fano d polytopes, the algo rithm needs not consult the previous output to check for isomorphism to decide whether or not to output a constructed polytope. 2 Smooth Fano polytopes We fix a notation and prove some simple facts about smooth Fano polytopes. 3 The convex hull of a set K Rd is denoted by convK. A polytope is the convex hull of finitely many points. The dimension of a polytope P is the dimension of the affine hull, affP, of the polytope P. A k polytope is a polytope of dimension k. A face of a polytope is the intersection of a supporting hyperplane with the polytope. Faces of polytopes are polytopes. Faces of dimension 0 are called vertices, while faces of codimension 1 and 2 are called facets and ridges, respectively. The set of vertices of a polytope P is denoted by V P . Definition 2.1. A convex lattice polytope P in Rd is called a smooth Fano d polytope, if the origin is contained in the interior of P and the vertices of every facet of P is a Z basis of the lattice Zd Rd. We consider two smooth Fano d polytopes P1, P2 to be isomorphic, if there exists a bijective linear map Rd Rd, such that Zd Zd and P1 P2. Whenever F is a d 1 simplex in Rd, such that 0 affF, we let uF Rd be the unique element determined . For every w V F we define uw F Rd to be the element where uw F , w 1 and uw F , w 0 for every w V F , w w. Then uw F w V F is the basis of Rd dual to the basis V F of Rd. When F is a facet of a smooth Fano polytope and v V P , we certainly have Z v V F and 0 v V F . The lemma below concerns the relation between the elements uF and uF , when F and F are adjacent facets. Lemma 2.2. Let F be a facet of a smooth Fano polytope P and v V F . Let F be the unique facet which intersects F in a ridge R of P, v V R . Let v V F V R . Then 1. uv F , v 1. 2. . 3. uv F , x 1 for any x Rd. 4.

Chunk: set of a special embedding of a smooth Fano d polytope P such that ord P V , in which case the polytope . For any given integer d 1 the function SFP calls the function AddPoint with input and . In this way a call SFP d will make the algorithm go through every finite subset of Wd containing , and smooth Fano d polytopes are outputted in strictly increasing order. It is vital for the effectiveness of the SFP algorithm, that there is some efficient way to check if a subset V Wd is a presubset of ord P for some smooth Fano d polytope P. The function AddPoint should perform this check before the recursive call AddPoint V, F . If P is any smooth Fano d polytope, then any presubset V of ord P is the minimal element in the set by lemma 4.5 . In other words, if there exists a permutation such that .V V , then the algorithm should not make the recursive call AddPoint V . But this is not the only test we wish to perform on a subset V before the recursive call. The function CheckSubset performs another test It takes a subset V , V Wd as input together with a finite set of d 1 simplices F, I F, and returns a set F of d 1 simplices containing F, if there exists a special embedding P of a smooth Fano d polytope, such that 5.2 An example of the reasoning in CheckSubset 11 1. V is a presubset of V P 2. F is a subset of the facets of P This is proved in theorem 5.1. If no such special embedding exists, then CheckSubset returns false in many cases, but not always! Only when CheckSubset V, F returns a set F of simplices, we allow the recursive call AddPoint V, F . Given input V Wd and a set F of d 1 simplices of Rd, the function CheckSubset works in the following way Suppose V is a presubset of V P for some special embedding P of a smooth Fano d polytope and F is a subset of the facets of P. Deduce as much as possible of the face lattice of P and look for contradictions to the lemmas stated in section 2. The more facets we know of P, the more restrictions we can put on the vertex set V P , and then on V . If a contradiction arises, return false. Otherwise, return the deduced set of facets of P. The following example illustrates how the function CheckSubset works. 5.2 An example of the reasoning in CheckSubset Let , where , , , , e1 e2 e4 e5 , , .

If V did contradict lemma 3.2, then the polytope P could not exist, and CheckSubset V, should return false.

Suppose the other one is , where v9 is some lattice point not in V , v9 V P . .2. and then v9 v7 by the definition of the ordering of lattice points Zd. But then V is not a presubset of V P .

Chunk: The first method is based on analysis of the CCF and is convenient for T D estimation of one active continuous AE source as is described in Part I , , . The CCF exhibits a peak when the delay parameter compensates the T D between the sensor signals . The T D is thus determined by the position of the highest peak of the CCF. The second method is based on BSS algorithm and is convenient for T D estimation of two or more simultaneously active continuous AE sources . Location of two simulta neously active AE sources was performed by an intelligent locator based on a general regression neural network as is described in Part I. Multichannel Blind Source Separation has recently received increased attention due to the importance of its potential 2 applications . It occurs in many fields of engineering and applied sciences, including processing of signals from antenna array, speech and geophysical data processing, noise reduction, biological system analysis, etc. It consists of recovering signals emitted by unknown sources and mixed by an unknown medium material where waves propagate , using only several observations of the mixtures. The only assumptions made are the linearity of the mixing system and the statistical independence of original signals. BSS methods may be classified in several ways. One possible classification that can be made depends on whether the mixtures are instantaneous or convolutive . Convo lutive mixtures correspond to a mixing system with time dependent memory. They represent a more general case than instantaneous mixtures, and they have in particular acoustic applications. Recently, the principle of independent component analysis ICA was applied in BSS, and it was found to be a simple and powerful tool . This study deals with the separation of two convolutively mixed independent continuous AE signals by ICA and the intelligent locator was used to locate two independent continuous AE sources based on T D . The mixing and filtering processes of unknown input signals sj t may have different mathematical or physical back grounds, depending on specific applications. In this paper, we focus mainly on the simplest cases with n signals xi t linearly mixed in n unknown statistically independent, zero mean source signals sj t . The composition is expressed in matrix notation as , where denotes a convolution, x1 t , . . . , xn t T is the vector of sensor signals, s1 t , . . . , sn t T is the vector of source signals and A is an unknown full rank n n mixing matrix whose elements are finite inpulse response FIR filters. We assume that only vector x is available. The goal of ICA is to find a matrix W , by which vector x can be transformed into source signals . Matrix W is simply the inverse of A. However, when noise corrupts the signals, matrix W must be found by an optimal statistical treatment of the inverse problem. The optimal ma trix W can be estimated by a feed forward neural network operating in the frequency domain. A learning algorithm with Amari s natural gradient can be written as W x, W 1 W W W 1 , I y uH W, R u tanh I u , where is the learning rate, is the constant of learning, I is the identity matrix and the tilde represents a frequency domain. The ICA algorithm runs off line and proceeds as follows Fig. 1 1 Pre process the time domain input signals, x t sub stract the mean from each signal. 2 Initialize the frequency domain unmixing filters, W . 3 Take a block of input data and convert it into the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform FFT . 4 Filter the frequency domain input block, x, through W to get the estimated source signals, u. 5 Pass u through the frequency domain

Reflections at the end of the band were reduced by wrapping the ends in putty.

The origin of the coordinate system was in the middle of the band and the testing area extended from 1.1 m to 1.1 m. AE signals were excited by two independent air jets flowing through the holes. The source position was arbitrarily selected at 100 mm and 800 mm. Air jets were formed by two nozzles of diameter 1 mm using pressure 7 bar.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0051v2 physics.ed ph 13 May 2008 Visualizing Teleportation Scott M. Cohen Department of Physics, Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15282 and Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213 A novel way of picturing the processing of quantum information is described, allowing a direct vi sualization of teleportation of quantum states and providing a simple and intuitive understanding of this fascinating phenomenon. The discussion is aimed at providing physicists a method of ex plaining teleportation to non scientists. The basic ideas of quantum physics are first explained in lay terms, after which these ideas are used with a graphical description, out of which teleportation arises naturally. I. INTRODUCTION One of the most exciting and fastest growing fields of physics today is quantum information. Especially since the discovery by Shor that there exist calculations for which a quantum computer is apparently far more efficient than a classical computer, interest in understanding quantum information has increased at an impressive rate. One widely publicized discovery that has emerged from work in this field is teleportation . While not precisely equivalent to the process enjoying widespread fame amongst fans of Star Trek Beam me up, Scotty , the phenomenon referred to here is nonetheless fascinating, and perhaps even astonishing. The reason for the widespread publicity of this rigorously proven and experimentally tested , though not yet unambiguously demonstrated scientific prediction is almost certainly in large part due to the fact that it shares the same name as the just mentioned, intriguing idea from science fiction. The usual way of describing teleportation is through mathematical equations, and this mathematics is relatively straightforward, as has been amply demonstrated elsewhere . Hence, an understanding of this phenomenon is accessible to physicists, other scientists, and those possessing a reasonably strong level of mathematical skill. There does, on the other hand, seem to be a good deal of misunderstanding of teleportation amongst non scientists, with the notion floating around that the amazing phenomenon shown regularly in episodes of Star Trek that is, of material objects being teleported from one place to another has actually turned out to be possible in real life. Nothing could be further from the truth, of course, so we are left wondering how to rectify this unfortunate state of affairs. The question I address here is the following can the true scientific phenomenon of teleportation be understood by others, those without much skill in mathematics? The usual explanations will certainly fail in this regard, even if carefully presented by a competent physicist, because mathematics has a well known tendency to scare people away, and in any case, the mathematics of teleportation is not all that simple. The paper is addressed to physicists possessing a solid understanding of quantum physics including graduate students , with the aim to provide a method by which such a physicist can explain teleportation to someone who is not mathematically inclined. Thus, the objective is ultimately, though indirectly, to educate the general public about teleportation, and by extension, quantum mechanics itself. The approach involves only the most basic ideas about quantum physics, and while it does not entirely avoid mathematical expressions, it uses only the simplest mathematics one only needs to accept that certain objects are either 0 or 1 and relies almost entirely on pictures , allowing the layperson to visualize and thus, understand what is happening. In the following sections, I will describe my method of directly visualizing teleportation. These sections are written as if addressed to the layperson. The next section explains the probabilistic nature of quantum physics by considering quantum coins , which are examples of two level systems. This section describes how one should think about measurements, what is meant by probabilities for classical systems, and then how these ideas can be used to describe quantum systems. Then, in Section III, I present my graphical approach to understanding the dynamics of quantum information processing, which

Chunk: Alice and coin b to Bob, but again does not allow these parties to look at their coins. Alice now asks Chloe the following two questions Are coins A and a the same? Or are they different? This pair of yes no questions represents a measurement, as defined earlier, on this pair of coins. If Chloe informs her they are the same, then Alice knows that coin b, which is guaranteed to be the same as a, is also the same as A if, on the other hand, Chloe says coins A and a are different, then coin b is also different from A. Alice now calls Bob on the telephone and tells him to flip or don t flip . In the first case A same as a she tells him not to flip, while when A and a are different, she tells him to flip. After he follows her instruction, Bob s coin b will with certainty match coin A. The state of coin A has been teleported onto coin b. It is instructive to look at why the quantum case is astonishing while the classical one is rather mundane. There are three important differences between classical and quantum teleportation. The first difference has to do with the information that Alice would need to transmit to Bob in order to inform him of the state of coin A, if she happened to know that state. For a classical coin, there are only two possibilities, H or T , so she would need to transmit only one bit to Bob. This is the same amount of information that is actually transmitted when she tells him flip or don t flip again, two possibilities. In contrast, as was discussed at the beginning of Section III for the case of quantum coins, it would require an infinite amount of information for Alice to inform Bob of the state of coin A, whereas she only actually transmits two bits of information when informing him which of her four questions was the outcome of her measurement. We see that the two cases, classical vs. quantum, are dramatically different in terms of the amounts of information involved. The second difference between these two cases is a bit more subtle. In the classical case, if Alice were to cheat and actually look at coin A, she would automatically know what state that coin is in and be able to tell Bob what to do with his coin turn it H or turn it T another one bit message encompassing these two possibilities. This absolutely will not work for a quantum coin, which Alice cannot simply look at to discover its state. The reason is the following To begin with, in contrast to a classical coin, when Alice looks at her quantum coin, she invariably disturbs it in the process. That is, no matter what state the coin was in before she looked at it, the state after she looks at it is with certainty given by the outcome of her measurement. For example, even if the state is equal parts H and T before she asks if it is H or T , if the answer is H T , then the coin is now H T . Or if it is H to begin with and she does a measurement that answers yes to the question Is it equal parts H and T ? , then the state of 10 the coin will now be equal parts H and T . Hence, when she looks at it, she will get one of two answers those being the two possible outcomes of her measurement as to the state of the coin, but if she looks at it wrong, that answer will not tell her what the state was beforehand, but only what it is now. Furthermore, since she has now disturbed the state, there is

Chunk: is then used in Section III B to explain in pictures how teleportation of quantum states is possible. One of the crucial observations will be that a shared entangled state on, say, systems a and b, provides the parties with multiple images of the state of an additional system A. The ability to manipulate these images independently by each party, and differently from one image to the next is what allows teleportation to be accomplished. More generally, these ideas provide important insights into why entanglement is a valuable resource, as I have described in detail elsewhere, and they have been useful in understanding other aspects of quantum information Electronic address cohensm duq.edu 2 processing . II. PROBABILITIES Perhaps the most fundamental aspect of quantum theory is that it can only make predictions in terms of probabil ities. In general even if one has a complete description of the state of a quantum system, one will not know ahead of time what the outcome of a given measurement will be. This is in direct contradiction with our everyday experience, which we refer to as classical . For example, a flipped classical coin which lands heads heads is then a complete description of the state of this coin , is known with certainty to be heads, and also with certainty to not be tails. That is, if we know the state of a classical coin in this case heads , we can predict with certainty the answer to any reasonable question we choose to ask or measure about that coin for example, Is it tails? . We therefore need to understand what is meant by the state of a quantum system and how this state relates to probabilities and outcomes of measurements. The following definition of a measurement will be adequate for our purposes. Definition A measurement is a procedure that provides answers to a collection of yes no questions, which is both mutually exclusive when the answer to one of the questions is yes , the answer to all the others is no and complete all possibilities are included that is, one of the questions will always be answered in the affirmative . The single question that receives the yes answer is referred to as the outcome of the measurement. For example, since a classical coin is either heads or tails, and these two possibilities are mutually exclusive, a measurement on a classical coin is a procedure that answers the two questions Is it heads? and Is it tails? Since the coin will always be one or the other, there will always be a yes answer to one of these questions, and then the other question is always answered no . Hence these two questions do indeed constitute a measurement according to the above definition. If Is it heads? is answered affirmatively, then heads is the outcome of the measurement. It turns out that these two questions also constitute a measurement on quantum coins. However, in contrast to the classical case in which this is the only possible measurement, there is a vast array of possible measurements on quantum coins. This will become clearer from the discussion in the following sections, where we introduce a compact way of describing these things, a way commonly used in quantum mechanics. A. Classical coins and classical probabilities Consider again a flipped classical coin. The coin lands either heads or tails. It will be useful to use a somewhat abbreviated notation H for heads and T for tails. The statement that if it is heads, it is not tails that is, has zero probability of being tails will be represented . The left facing bracket H represents the known initial state It is heads. and the right facing bracket T represents the question Is it tails? . The number appearing on the right hand side of the equal sign then gives the probability that with

Chunk: two of them, by working together, to create the unknown state on Bob s coin b with the communication of only two classical bits. A. Visualizing quantum information processing Let us now introduce the pictorial method which will be used to visualize teleportation. The simple diagrams we will use to depict states of multiple quantum coins, held by two different parties, are familiar to many researchers working in quantum information. We will now illustrate how these diagrams are used to represent quantum states, and then how they can be used to follow what happens to these coins when measurements are performed by one of the parties. Then, we will be ready to use them for visualizing teleportation. 1. States of quantum coins To depict the state of a single quantum coin labeled A standing for Alice she will also have the other coin labeled a, while Bob s single coin is labeled b , we may use a simple box diagram, SA cH HA cT TA TA HA cT cH . The coefficients cH and cT appearing in the boxes indicate how much is in that part of the state SA of coin A. The next example illustrates the case where there are two coins A and b held by two different parties. Then, the state of these two coins might be SAHb Hb Tb TA HA cT cH , with SA as given above. The empty squares on the right hand side of this diagram represent the fact that system b is not T has zero probability of being tails the cH in the upper left corner represents the probability the coins are both heads and the cT in the lower left, the probability Bob s coin is heads and Alice s is tails. If there are three parties involved, a three dimensional cube could be used to represent this situation. However, it will serve our present purposes to represent both of Alice s systems along the vertical dimension of the diagram. We might have coins A and b as in the previous example, and coin a being heads, the overall state of these three coins represented as SAHaHb Hb Tb TAHa HAHa TATa HATa cT cH . 6 If instead the a,b systems are both T , this picture is SATaTb Hb Tb TAHa HAHa TATa HATa cT cH . Now consider what happens if we add the previous two equations together. Then our two coins a,b are equal parts in HH and in T T , which is what we previously referred to as the maximally entangled state B0 HaHb TaTb . The corresponding diagram looks like SA HaHb TaTb Hb Tb TAHa HAHa TATa HATa cT cH cT Hb Tb Ta Ha SA SA . Notice how there are now two images of the state SA . This observation turns out to be rather useful in understanding entanglement , but we will not need to discuss such issues here. Let us now look at how to represent measurements by use of these diagrams. 2. Measurements on quantum coins Suppose Alice and Bob share three quantum coins in the state represented in the last equation of the previous section, and Alice wants to know something about her coins. If she measures coin a and discovers it is H, then we have Ha Hb Tb Ta Ha SA Hb Tb SA . Recall that when the right facing bracket on the left of this equation, we , which preserves the upper row, , indicating that the bottom row is annihilated multiplied by 0 , which is why it no longer appears on the far right of this equation. The interpretation is as follows when the question Is coin a heads? is answered in the affirmative the other coins are left in the state SAHb . We see how this measurement acts on both of the images simultaneously, rather

We study space time symmetries in scalar quantum field theory including interacting theories on static space times. We first consider Euclidean quantum field theory on a static Riemannian mani fold, and show that the isometry group is generated by one parameter subgroups which have either self adjoint or unitary quantizations. We analytically continue the self adjoint semigroups to one parameter uni tary groups, and thus construct a unitary representation of the isometry group of the associated Lorentzian manifold. The method is illustrated for the example of hyperbolic space, whose Lorentzian continuation is Anti de Sitter space. 1. Introduction The extension of quantum field theory to curved space times has led to the discovery of many qualitatively new phenomena which do not occur in the simpler theory on Minkowski space, such as Hawking radiation for background and historical

In Riemannian geometry there is a canonical linear connection on the manifold M, while in Finsler geometry there is a corresponding canonical linear connection, due to E. Cartan, which is not a connection on M but is a connection on 1 TM , the pullback of the tangent bundle TM by T M M the pullback approach . Moreover, in Riemannian geometry there is one curvature tensor and one torsion tensor associated with a given linear connection on the manifold M, whereas in Finsler geometry there are three curvature tensors and five torsion tensors associated with a given linear connection on 1 TM . Most of the special spaces in Finsler geometry are derived from the fact that the tensor fields torsions and curvatures associated with the Cartan connection satisfy special forms. Consequently, special spaces of Finsler geometry are more numerous than those of Riemannian geometry. Special Finsler spaces are investigated locally using local coordinates by many authors M. Matsumoto , , , and others , , , . On the other hand, the global or intrinsic, free from local coordinates investigation of such spaces is very rare in the literature. Some considerable contributions in this direction are due to A. Tamim , . In the present paper, we provide a global presentation of the theory of special Finsler manifolds. We introduce and investigate globally many of the most important and most commonly used special Finsler manifolds locally Minkowskian, Berwald, Landesberg, general Landesberg, P reducible, C reducible, semi C reducible, quasi C reducible, P Finsler, Ch recurrent, Cv reciprocal, C0 reciprocal, Sv reciprocal, C2 like, S3 like, S4 like, P2 like, R3 like, P symmetric, h isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant curvature, of p scalar curvature, of s ps curvature.

As M, L is P2 like, then from , we have bP X, Y oT X, Y . Using Lemma 3.1, we get T X, Y 0T X, Y , from which, by taking the trace, 0T, where C,C C2 . Hence the result. The next definition will be useful in the sequel. Definition 3.33. A tensor field is positively homogenous of degree r in the directional argument y symbolically, h r if it satisfies the condition r , or D r . Lemma 3.34. Let M, L be a Finsler manifold, then we have a The Finsler metric g the angular metric tensor is homogenous of degree 0, b The v curvature tensor S is homogenous of degree 2, c The hv curvature tensor P is homogenous of degree 1, d The h curvature tensor R is homogenous of degree 0, e The h hv torsion tensor T is homogenous of degree 1, f The v hv torsion tensor bP is homogenous of degree 0, g The v h torsion tensor bR is homogenous of degree 1. Lemma 3.35. For every vector form A, we have 1 1 A X, Y, Z 1 1 A Y, X, Z A R X, Y Z R X, Y A Z bR X, Y A Z . Deicke theorem can be formulated globally as follows Lemma 3.36. Let M, L be a Finsler manifold. The following assertions are equivalent a M, L is Riemannian, b The h hv torsion tensor T vanishes, c The form C vanishes. Theorem 3.37. Let M, L be Finsler manifold which is h isotropic of scalar k0 and Ch recurrent of recurrence vector 0 . Then, M, L is necessarily one of the following a A Riemannian manifold of constant curvature, b A Finsler manifold of dimension 2, c A Finsler manifold of dimensions n 3 with vanishing scalar k0 and X o Y Y o X . 19 Proof. For a Ch recurrent manifold, one can easily show that 1 1 T X, Y, Z, W 1 1 T Y, X, Z, W T Z, W X, Y T Z, W . From which, taking into account Lemma 3.35, we obtain X, Y T Z, W T R X, Y Z, W T Z, R X, Y W R X, Y T Z, W b R X, Y T Z, W . Now, as M, L is h isotropic of scalar k0, then the h curvature tensor R has the form R X, Y n 3 . From the above two equations, we get X, Y T Z, W k0g X, Z T Y, W k0g Y, Z T X, W k0g X, W T Z, Y k0g Y, W T Z, X k0g X, T Z, W Y k0g Y, T Z, W X k0g X, Y T Z, W k0g Y, XT Z, W . Setting , noting that T is h 1 and g , L2, we get X, T Z, W k0g , Z T X, W k0g , W T Z, X k0T X, Z, W k0g X, T Z, W k0L2 XT Z, W . From which, we have g Y, X, T Z, W k0g Y, g , Z T X, W k0g Y, g , W T Z, X k0g Y, T X, Z, W k0g Y, g X, T Z, W k0L2g Y, XT Z, W , whereas g X, Y, T Z, W k0g X, g , Z T Y, W k0g X, g , W T Z, Y k0g X, T Y, Z, W k0g X, g Y, T Z, W k0L2g X, Y T Z, W .

Chunk: Z, W U X, Y k0L2 . Taking the trace of both sides of the above equation, we get C Z 2k0L2 . Setting C, taking into account the fact that X, C C X , the above equation reduces to C C 0. 20 Now, if C C g C, C 0, then 0. Consequently, by Lemma 3.36, M, L is a Riemannian manifold of constant curvature. On the other hand, if M, L is not Riemannian, then we have L2 X, Y g Y, X, g X, Y, 0. From which, together with , we get . If k0 0, then, by , X, Z C Y Y, Z C X . Setting C, we get X, Z 1 C2C X C Z , which implies that dim . If , then X, Y 0, which means that X o Y Y o X . Now, we focus our attention to the interesting case c of the above theorem. In this case, the h curvature tensor v h torsion tensor . Therefore, the equation deduced from XR Y, Z, W Y P Z, X, W ZP Y, X, W P Z, P Y, X W R T X, Y , Z W S R Y, Z , X W P Y, P Z, X W R T X, Z , Y . reduces to Y P Z, X, W ZP Y, X, W P Z, bP Y, X W P Y, bP Z, X . Setting , we get Y bP Z, X Z bP Y, X bP Z, bP Y, X bP Y, bP Z, X 0. Since M, L is Ch recurrent, then, by Proposition 3.17, the v hv torsion tensor bP satisfies the relations Z bP X, Y Ko o Z ZKo T X, Y and bP X, Y o T X, Y KoT X, Y . From these, together with , we get Ko o Y Y Ko T Z, X Ko o Z ZKo T X, Y K2 oT Z, T X, Y K2 oT Y, T X, Z 0. Hence, by Corollary 3.19, K2 oS Y, Z, X, W U Y, Z . As S Y, Z, X, W is skew symmetric in the arguments X and W while the right hand side is symmetric in the same arguments, we obtain K2 oS Y, Z, X, W 0, U Y, . It follows from and that 21 P X, Y, Z, W o Z T X, Y, W o W T X, Y, Z . On the other hand, if Ko 0, then the v curvature tensor S vanishes from . Next, it is seen from that, if V Y Ko o Y Y Ko 0, then there exists a scalar function T X, Z, W T X, Y, Z T Y, Z, W T X, Y, W 2 V Z 3 such that T X, Y, W V X V Y V W . Summing up, we have Theorem 3.38. Let M, L be a Finsler manifold of dimensions n 3.

Chunk: m Y, Z 2t . Therefore, by taking , we have P R X, Y, Z, W Ro . Consequently, the given manifold is of p scalar curvature. 25 Theorem 3.53. If an R3 like Finsler manifold M, L is of p scalar curvature, then it is of s ps curvature. Proof. Since the considered manifold is R3 like, then, by the same procedure as in the proof of Proposition 3.52, we have P R X, Y, Z, W X, Z m Y, W Y, W m X, Z Y, Z m X, W X, W m Y, Z . On the other hand, since the considered manifold is of p scalar curvature, then the h curvature tensor satisfies P R X, Y, Z, W Ro . Now, from Equations and , we obtain U X, . Using and the non degeneracy of the metric tensor g, the above equation reduces to U X, . Since the tensor fields , m and mo are indicatory, then X, Z X, Z , X, Z , X, Z . Consequently, if we take the trace of both sides of Equation , making use of Lemma 3.43, we get n 2 Ro X, Z n 3 m X, Z n 1 t X, Z 0, where t 1 n 1 Tr mo . From which, using and Lemma 3.2, we get n 2 Ro n 3 mo n 1 t 0. Again, taking the trace of the above equation, we obtain n 1 n 2 Ro 2t 0. Substituting the above relation into , we get . Hence, by Proposition 3.52, the result follows. Theorem 3.54. If an R3 like Finsler manifold M, L is of scalar curvature, then it is of s ps curvature. Proof. Since the given manifold is R3 like, then the tensor H is given by cf. Proposition 3.48 H X L2 . And since the considered manifold is of scalar curvature, then H X L2 X . From Equations and , we deduce that mo X c X t X . Hence, by Proposition 3.52, the result follows. Now, let us define the tensor field X, Y, Z, W R X, Y, Z, W 1 n 2U X, Y g X, Z Rich Y, W g Y, W Rich X, Z rg X, Z g Y, W , where . From Definition 2.14 and , we immediately obtain 26 Theorem 3.55.

From which, by setting and noting that P X, Y T X, Y , the result follows. 10 b Since M, L is a P reducible manifold, then by Definition 2.11, taking into account the fact that g is nondegenerate, we obtain P X, Y X Y Y X X, Y , where is the vector field defined by g , X X .

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0054v1 math.CA 2 Apr 2007 The Hardy Lorentz Spaces Hp,q Rn Wael Abu Shammala and Alberto Torchinsky Abstract In this paper we consider the Hardy Lorentz spaces Hp,q Rn , with , . We discuss the atomic decomposition of the elements in these spaces, their interpolation properties, and the behavior of singular integrals and other operators acting on them. The real variable theory of the Hardy spaces represents a fruitful setting for the study of maximal functions and singular integral operators. In fact, it is because of the failure of these operators to preserve L1 that the Hardy space H1 assumes its prominent role in harmonic analysis. Now, for many of these operators, the role of L1 can just as well be played by H1, , or Weak H1. However, although these operators are amenable to H1 L1 and H1, L1, estimates, interpolation between H1 and H1, has not been available. Similar considerations apply to Hp and Weak Hp for 1. The purpose of this paper is to provide an interpolation result for the Hardy Lorentz spaces Hp,q, , , including the case of Weak Hp as and end point for real interpolation. The atomic decomposition is the key ingredient in dealing with interpolation since in this context neither truncations are available, nor reiteration applies. The paper is organized as follows. The Lorentz spaces, including criteria that assure membership in Lp,q, , , are discussed in Section 1. In Section 2 we show that distributions in Hp,q have an atomic decomposition in terms of Hp atoms with coefficients in an appropriate mixed norm space. An interesting application of this decomposition is to Hp,q Lp, estimates for Calder on Zygmund singular integral operators, . Also, by manipulating the different levels of the atomic decomposition, we show that, for , Hp,q is an intermediate space between Hp,q1 and Hp,q2. This result applies to Calder on Zygmund singular integral operators, including those with variable kernels, Marcinkiewicz integrals, and other operators. 1 1 The Lorentz spaces The Lorentz space Lp,q Rn Lp,q, , , consists of those measurable functions f with finite quasinorm f p,q given by f p, q p Z 0 t1 pf t q dt t 1 q , , f p, sup t1 pf t , . The Lorentz quasinorm may also be given in terms of the distribution func tion m f, , loosely speaking, the inverse of the non increasing rearrangement f of f. Indeed, we have f p, q p Z 0 q 1m f, q p d 1 q X k 2km f, 2k 1 p q 1 q , when , and f p, sup k 2km f, 2k 1 p , . Note that, in particular, Lp, , and Lp, is weak Lp. The following two results are useful in verifying that a function is in Lp,q. Lemma 1.1. Let , and . Assume that the non negative sequence satisfies lq. Further suppose that the non negative function verifies the following property there exists 1 such that, given an arbitrary integer k0, we have k0 k0, where k0 is essentially bounded and satisfies k0 c 2k0, and 2k0 p m k0, 2k0 c X k0 2k k p . Then, Lp,q, and p,q c lq. Proof. It clearly suffices to verify that 1 p , where is an arbitrary positive constant. Now, given k0, let k0 and k0 be as above, and put c 1, where c is the constant in the above inequalities for this choice of , . 2 When , we have 2k0 m k0, 2k0 1 p c X k0 2 k 1 2k k p 1 p c 2 k0 1 sup k k0 2k k . Thus, 2k0 m k0, 2k0 1 p supk k0 2k k , and, consequently, 2k0 m , 2k0 1 p c l , all k0. When , let 1 2 and k0 1 be a positive constant and a large integer, respectively. We are left with a very similar argument, slightly simplified as follows: 2k0 m, 2k0 1 p c supk k0 2k k and, consequently, 2k0 m c l, all k0, as desired and the proof of Lemma 1.1 is complete. Lemma 1.2 Let , and . Assume that the sequence satisfies lq. Further suppose that the non negative function verifies the following property there exists 1 such that, for each k0, there exist disjoint intevals T0(k0), , Tk0(k0) such that Tk0(k0) is essentially contained in the interval Tk0(k0), , and that (1) 2 k m c Xi=0 mk 2i k p or 2 k m c Xi=1 mk 2i+1 k p, with either i = 0 or i = 1, and (ii) , where 1 2 denotes the usual cutoff function supported in the interval Tk0(k0). Then, Lp,q, and p,q

Chunk: rewrite the right hand side above as X k0 1 2k p 2k 1 k p . When , by H older s inequality with exponent , this expression is dominated by X k0 1 2k pr 1 r X k0 h 2k 1 k irp 1 r c 2 k0 p X k0 h 2k 1 k iq p q , and, when , , and we get a similar bound by simply observing that it does not exceed 2 k0 p X k0 2k 1 k p r r 2 k0 p X k0 h 2k 1 k iq p q . Whence, continuing with the estimate, we have 2k0 p m k0, 2k0 c 2 k0 p X k0 h 2k 1 k iq p q , which yields, since 1 2 , 2k0 m , 2k0 1 p c 2k0 X k0 h 2k 1 k iq 1 q . 3 Thus, raising to the q and summing, we get X k0 2k0 m , 2k0 1 p q c X k0 2k0 q X 2k 1 k q , which, upon changing the order of summation in the right hand side of the above inequality, is bounded by X k 2k 1 k q h k X qi c X k 2k k q . The reader will have no difficulty in verifying that, for Lemma 1.1 to hold, it suffices that x0 satisfies m x0, 2k0 1 p c k0 , all k0 . This holds, for instance, when x0 r r c 2k0r p k0, . In fact, the assumptions of Lemma 1.1 correspond to the limiting case of this inequality as r . Another useful condition is given by our next result, the proof is left to the reader. Lemma 1.2. Let , and let the non negative sequence be such that lq, . Further, suppose that the non negative function satisfies the following property there exists 1 such that, given an arbitrary integer k0, we have k0 k0, where k0 and k0 satisfy 2k0pm k0, 2k0 c k0 X 2k k p , min 1, q p , 2k0 c X k0 2k k p . Then, Lp,q, and p,q c lq. We will also require some basic concepts from the theory of real interpo lation. Let A0, A1, be a compatible couple of quasinormed Banach spaces, 4 i.e., both A0 and A1 are continuously embedded in a larger topological vector space. The Peetre K functional of f A0 A1 at t, f A0, A1 inf , where , f0 A0 and f1 A1. In the particular case of the Lq spaces, the K functional can be computed by Holmstedt s formula, see . Specifically, for q1 , let be given by 1 1 q0 1 q1. Then, K t, f Lq0, Lq1 Z t 0 f s q0ds 1 q0 t Z t f s q1ds 1 q1 .

Finally, for the Lq and Lp,q spaces, we have the following result. Let , and suppose that 1 1 q1 q2. Then, Lq1, Lq2 ,q, and, L1, L1,q1, L1,q2 ,q, see . 2 The Hardy Lorentz spaces Hp,q In this paper we adopt the atomic characterization of the Hardy spaces Hp, . Recall that a compactly supported function a with n 1 p 1 vanishing moments is an Hp atom with defining interval I of course, I is a cube in Rn , if supp a I, and I 1 p a x 1. The Hardy space Hp Rn Hp consists of those distributions f that can be written as jaj, where aj are Hp atoms, a j j j=1 , and the series is unconditionally convergent in the norm defined by norm f Hp = 1 L( 1 p 1 ) . In other words, f bj ajb , b j j j =1 , and 1 L( 1 p 1 ) , where the series is unconditionally convergent. The classical Hardy space Hp C is recovered as a special case of Hp, namely Hp,q=1 . Also, in this paper, when we refer to the Hardy Lorentz space Hp,q it will always be the Hp,q appearing in this definition.

The reader will have no difficulty in verifying that Theorem 2.5 gives that if T is a continuous, sublinear map from H1 into L1, and from H1, into L1, , then Tf 1,q c f H1,q for . This observation has numerous applications. For instance, consider the Calder on Zygmund singular integral operators with variable kernel defined by T f x p.v. Z Rn x, x y x y n f y dy . Under appropriate growth and smoothness assumptions on , T maps H1 continuously into L1, see , and H1, continuously into L1, , see . Thus, if satisfies the assumptions of both of these results, T maps H1,q contin uously into L1,q for . A similar result follows by invoking the characterization of H1,q given by C. Fefferman, Rivi ere and Sagher. How ever, in this case the Hp Lp estimate requires additional smoothness of , as shown, for instance, in . Similar considerations apply to the Marcinkiewicz integral, see , and . Finally, when , our results cover, for instance, the CZ operators satisfying , see . These oper ators, as well as a more general related class introduced in , preserve Hp and Hp, for n n p 1, and, consequently, by Theorem 2.5, they also preserve Hp,q for p in that same range, and .

Remember to keep the answers concise and focused. Homstedt's formula is a result in mathematics that aids in understanding the relationship between certain sets and their dimensions. In this academic chunk, it's used to show the equivalence between Hp,q spaces.

Theorem 2.5 impacts the idea of continuous sublinear maps in a function space by showing that if such maps T apply to f1,q they can be moved to f Hp,q. This is key to proving how these maps and spaces are related.

Calderon-Zygmund singular integral operators with variable kernel are mathematical operators that play a big role in the Hp Lp estimates. They're defined based on a kernel function. If this function satisfies certain conditions, the operators can map H1 continuously into L1 and H1 into L1

Chunk: along the planes. The K intercalation causes a shift of every second carbon layer resulting into an AA stacking of the graphite sheets. The K atoms then simply occupy the sites over the hollows of every fourth carbon hexagon. The order of the K atoms perpendicular to the planes is described by the stacking, illustrated in Fig. 2.

The contour spacing is 20 meV per formula unit and are shown relative to the energy minimum at a, dC C 2.494 A, 5.53 A . V. DISCUSSION Table I presents an overview of our structural results obtained with the vdW DF for graphite and C8K. The table also contrasts the results with the corresponding values calculated with PBE where available. The vdW DF value dC .53 A for the C8K C C layer sep aration is 3 larger than the experimentally observed value whereas the PBE value corresponds to less than a 1 expansion. Our vdW DF result for the C8K bulk modulus 26 GPa is also softer than the PBE result 37 GPa and further away from the experimental esti mates 47 GPa based on measurements of the C33 elastic response.18 A small overestimation of atomic separation is consistent with the vdW DF behavior that has been documented in a wide range of both finite and extended systems.14,15,16,17,29,30,33,34 This overestimation results, at least in part, from our choice of parametrization of the exchange behavior an aspect that lies beyond the present vdW DF implementation which focuses on improving the account of the nonlocal correlations, per se. It is likely that systematic investigations of the ex change effects can further refine the accuracy of vdW DF implementations.56 In any case, vdW DF theory calcu lations represent, in contrast to PBE, the only approach to obtain a full ab initio characterization of the AM in tercalation process. The C8K system is more compact than graphite and this explains why PBE alone can here provide a good de scription of the materials structure and at least some ma terials properties, whereas it fails completely for graphite. The distance between the graphene sheets upon interca lation of potassium atoms is stretched compared to that of pure graphite, but the K layer to graphite layer separation, dC 2.77 A, is smaller than expected. The difference in the graphite and C8K lay er thicknesses is mainly the result of the K atoms occup 6 occupying the sites above the hollows of every fourth carbon hexagon. This behavior results in a shift of every second carbon layer, resulting in a doubling of the graphite structure to an AA stacking of the graphite sheets. The PBE method overestimates both the binding energy between the layers and the interaction energy between the carbon and potassium layer. This is mainly a consequence of the fact that PBE results in a larger underestimation of the interlayer distance, dC 2.61 A, than DFT using van der Waals density functional vdW DF, which are in agreement with exper imental observation. Based on this work on C8K, the main focus is the difference in the accuracy when comparing the vdW DF and PBE methods. In the context of graphite, vdW DF is superior to PBE because it includes van der Waals forces which are known to play a role in graphite structures. In the case of C8K, the vdW DF method seems better at capturing the correct equilibrium

Chunk: likely held together, at least in part, by shorter ranged interactions. Table II documents that the vdW binding neverthe less plays an important role in the binding and forma tion of C8K. The table summarizes and contrasts our vdW DF and PBE results for graphite exfoliation and layer binding energies as well as C8K interlayer binding and formation energies. The vdW DF result for the C8K formation energy is smaller than experimental measure ments by 31 but it nevertheless represent a physically motivated ab initio calculation. In contrast, the C8K formation energy is simply unavailable in PBE because PBE, as indicated, fails to describe the layer binding in graphite. Moreover, for the vdW DF PBE comparisons that we can make for example, of the C8K layer inter action EC8K acc the vdW DF is found to significantly strengthen the bonding compared with PBE. It is also interesting to note that the combination of shorter ranged and vdW bonding components in C8K yields a layer binding energy that is close to that of the graphite case. In spite of the difference in nature of interactions, we find almost identical binding energies per layer for the case of the exfoliation and accordion in graphite and for the accordion in C8K. This observation testifies to a perhaps surprising strength of the so called soft matter vdW interactions. In a wider perspective our vdW DF permits a first comparison of the range of AM graphite systems from adsorption over absorption to full intercalation and thus 9 insight on the intercalation progress. Assuming a dense 2 2 configuration, we find that the energy for potassium adsorption and absorption is nearly degenerate with an indication that absorption is slightly preferred, consis tent with experimental behavior. We also find that the potassium absorption may eventually proceeds towards full intercalation thanks to a significant release of forma tion energy. VI. CONCLUSIONS The potassium intercalation process in graphite has been investigated by means of the vdW DF density func tional method. This method includes the dispersive in teractions needed for a consistent investigation of the intercalation process. For clean graphite the vdW DF predicts contrary to standard semilocal DFT imple mentations a stabilized bulk system with equilibrium crystal parameters in close agreement with experiments. Two limits of the absorption process have been inves tigated by the vdW DF, namely single layer subsurface absorption and the fully potassium intercalated stage 1 crystal C8K. Here the vdW DF is shown to enhance the semi local type of bonding described by traditional ap proaches. The significant impact on the materials behav ior indicates that the vdW DF is needed not only for a consistent description of sparse matter systems that are solely stabilized by dispersion forces, but also for their intercalates.

Chunk: body response of the weakly inhomogeneous electron gas Enl n r r, r n r . The nonlocal kernel r, r can be tabulated in terms of the separation r r between the two fragments at positions r and r through the parameters q0 q 0 r r 2 and q0 q 0 q0 q 0 . Here q0 is a local parameter that depends on the electron density and its gradient at position r. The analytic expression for the kernel in terms of D and can be found in Ref. 16. For periodic systems, such as bulk graphite, C8K, and the graphite surface with adsorbed or absorbed K atoms , the nonlocal correlation per unit cell is simply evaluated from the interaction of the points in the unit cell V0 with points everywhere in space V in the three for bulk graphite and C8K or two for the graphite surface dimensions of periodicity. Thus, the V integral in Eq. in principle requires a representation of the electron density infinitely repeated in space. In prac tice, the nonlocal correlation rapidly converges31 and it suffices with repetitions of the unit cell a few times in each spatial direction. For graphite bulk the V integral is converged when we use a V that extends 9 times the original unit cell in directions parallel perpendicular to the sheets. For the potassium investigation a signif icantly larger original unit cell is adopted see Fig. 2 here a fully converged V corresponds to a cell extending five three times the original cell in the direction parallel perpendicular to the sheets for C8K bulk. To describe the nonlocal correlations for the graphite surface a sufficient V extends five times the original unit cell along the carbon sheets. For the exchange energy Ex we follow the choice of Ref. 16 of using revPBE27 exchange. Among the func tionals that we have easy access to, the revPBE has proved to be the best candidate for minimizing the ten dency of artificial exchange binding in graphite.15 Using the scheme described above to evaluate Enl c , the total energy finally reads EvdW , where EGGA is the GGA total energy with the revPBE choice for the exchange description and EGGA c ELDA c the GGA LDA correlation energy. As our GGA calcu lations in this specific application of vdW DF are carried out in PBE, not revPBE, we further need to explicitly replace the PBE exchange in EGGA by that of revPBE for the same electron charge density distribution. B. Convergence of the local and nonlocal energy variation DFT calculations provide physically meaningful results for energy differences between total energies . To un derstand materials and processes we must compare total 4 energy differences between a system with all constituents at relatively close distance and a system of two or more fragments at infinite separation the reference system . Since the total energy consists both of a long range term and shorter ranged GGA and LDA terms it is nat ural to choose different ways to represent the separated fragments for these different long or short range energy terms. For the shorter range energy parts LDA and GGA terms the reference system is a full system with vacuum between the fragments. For LDA and GGA calculations it normally suffices to make sure that the charge den sity tails of the fragments do not overlap, but here we find that the surface dipoles cause a slower convergence with layer separation. We use a system with the layer separation between the potassium layer and the nearest graphite layer s dC A 8 A as reference for the adsorption absorption study. The evaluation of the nonlocal correlations Enl c requires additional care. This is due to technical reasons per taining to numerically stability in basing the Enl c eval uation on the FFT grid used to converge the underly ing traditional DFT

Chunk: graphite surface was deduced to 52 5 meV atom. Our value 55 meV C atom is also consistent with a separate vdW DF determination29 of the binding 47 meV per in plane atom between two otherwise isolated graphene sheets. For the energies of the absorbate system and of the C8K intercalate a few other graphite related energy con tributions are needed. The energy of collecting C atoms to form a graphene sheet at lattice constant a from iso lated spinpolarized atoms is given by EC layer a we find that changing the lattice constant a from aG to the equilibrium value aC8K of C8K causes this energy to change a mere 30 meV per 2 2 sheet. The contri bution EG acc is the energy of moving bulk graphite layers in this case four periodically repeated layers far away from each other, by expanding the unit cell along the direction perpendicular to the layers. Thus, EG ,coh aG, cG 2 4 EC layer aG tak ing the number of atoms and layers per unit cell into account. We find the value EG 2 2 four layer unit cell. This corresponds to 50 meV per C atom, again consistent with our result for the ex foliation energy, EC G . B. Creating a layer of K atoms The artificial step of creating a layer of potassium atoms from isolated atoms releases a significant energy EK layer. This energy contains the energy variation with in plane lattice constant and the energy cost of changing from a spin polarized to a spin balanced elec tron configuration for the isolated atom.54 The creation of the K layer provides an energy gain which is about half an eV per potassium atom, depending on the final lattice constant. With the graphite lattice constant aG the energy change, including the spin change cost, is EK layer aG 476 meV per K atom in vdW DF 624 meV when calculated within PBE , whereas EK layer aC8K 473 meV in vdW DF. C. Graphite on surface adsorption of potassium The potassium atoms are adsorbed on a usual ABA . . . stacked graphite surface. We consider here full one monolayer coverage, which is one potassium atom per 2 2 graphite surface unit cell. This orders the potassium atoms in a honeycomb structure with lattice constant 2aG, and a nearest neighbor distance within the K layer of aG. The unit cell used in the standard DFT calculations for adsorption and absorption has a height of 40 A and includes a vacuum region sufficiently big that no interac tions within GGA can occur between the top graphene sheet and the slab bottom in the periodically repeated image of the slab. The vacuum region is also large in order to guarantee that the separation from any atom to the dipole layer55 always remains larger than 4 A. In the top panel of Fig. 4 we show the adsorption en ergy per potassium atom. The adsorption energy at equi librium is 937 meV per K atom at distance dC .02 A from the graphite surface.

Chunk: model as an ideal candidate for a complete reconstruction of the phase diagram. Unfor tunately, the model potential turns out to be not simple enough to allow for a straightforward identification of the structure of its solid phase s and, in this respect, the original paper is in fact reticent. We have made an attempt to resolve the solid structure in terms of stretched cubic lattices but a direct inspection of many equilibrated solid configurations reveals more complicate, yet periodically repeated patterns. Probably, this results from a difficult matching between the optimization re quirements of the different pair potential components, i.e., a cylindrically symmetric hard core repulsion and a spherically symmetric step like attraction. To retain nematic reentrance and, possibly, also the smectic phase, we have considered a more tractable test case, that is a uniaxial deformation of the repulsive Gaus sian potential, which we expect to provide a model ne matic fluid whose phase diagram can fully be worked out, also in its solid region. It can plausibly be argued on sym metry grounds and also expected from the smoothness of 2 the potential that all solid phases of the model will now be found within the class of uniaxially stretched cubic crystals. The rest of the paper is organized as follows In Sec tion II, we present our liquid crystal model together with a catalogue of crystal structures that are possibly rele vant to it. Next, in Section III, we outline the numer ical methods by which the phase diagram of the model is being drawn. Results are exposed in Section IV while further comments and conclusions are deferred to Section V. MODEL We consider a nematic fluid of N parallel ellipsoids of revolution whose geometric boundaries are smeared out by a pair interaction u that smoothly depends on the ratio between the center to center distance r and the contact distance , which is the distance of closest ap proach in case of sharp boundaries. is a function of the angle that the ray r joining the two molecular centers forms with the direction z of the axis of revolution. Its closed form expression is easily found to be LD p L2 sin2 D2 cos2 , D and L being the transversal with respect to z and the longitudinal diameter respectively we hereafter consider only the prolate case . For uniaxial particles, the functional dependence of is actually on cos , as ex emplified by Eq. . We also note that hard ellipsoids do correspond to an interaction strenght being for and zero otherwise. For the efficiency of numerical calculation, sufficiently short range interaction in all directions is highly desir able and, among smooth interactions, a good choice is a Gaussian decaying two body repulsion, u r, o exp r2 2 , o 0 being an arbitrary energy scale. Eq. defines the Gaussian core nematic GCN fluid. It is evident that, upon increasing the aspect ratio L D, larger and larger system sizes are needed in order to pull down any rounding offerror that is implicit e.g. in the numerical calculation of the total energy. Another crucial quantity to determine in a simulation is the pressure. For a V volume system of N parallel ellipsoids in contact with a heat bath at temperature T , the equilibrium pressure P can be calculated from a virial theorem that generalizes the one valid for a sim ple fluid. Let the total potential energy of the system be of the general form j u Ri Rj , cos ij , where Ri is the center of mass position of particle i and cos Ri Rj z. Upon switching to scaled V 1 3Ri coordinates, one readily gets 1 3V X 1 Rij, cos ij , where u 1 is the u derivative with respect to its first argument, N V is the number density, and kB is Boltzmann s constant.

Chunk: concerned, its value is chosen in a way such that com plies with the pressure of the low temperature reference state, that is the one from which the NPT sequence of runs is started. We wish to emphasize that, thanks to the large sample sizes employed, the density histogram in a NPT run always turned out to be sharply peaked, indi cating very limited density fluctuations hence, negligible ensemble dependence of statistical averages . RESULTS Zero temperature calculations For various L D values in the interval between 1.1 and 3, we have calculated the P for our eleven candidate ground states, with P ranging from 0 to 0.20. We report in Table 1 the results relative to L , 0.05 and 0.20. An emergent aspect of this Table is the exis tence of a rich degeneracy that is only partly a result of the effective identity of crystal structures up to a dila tion. Take e.g. the five structures with the minimum and with the same density . While the BCC001 lattice with 3 is obtained from the FCC001 lattice with 3 .12 . . . by a simple 2 dilation, there is no homothety transforming BCC001 into BCC110 or into BCC111 in turn equivalent to SC111 Points in these three lattices have different local envi ronments, as can be checked by counting the nth order neighbors for n up to 4, yet the three stretched BCC crys tals of minimum share the same U N. Also the pairs FCC110 , FCC111 and SC001 , SC110 consist of topologically different degenerate structures. This fact is an emergent phenomenon whose deep reason remains 5 unclear to us it should deal with the dependence of u on the ratio r , since the same symmetry holds with a polynomial, rather than Gaussian, dependence. For the case of L , we show in Fig. 1 the over all P dependence at for the various solids. The solid with the minimum is either of the type FCC001 with 3 or, say, of the type BCC001 with 3 , a fact that holds true, but with L D, for all 3. Other solids are definitely ruled out, and the same will probably hold for . On increasing L D, the transition from a FCC type to a BCC type phase occurs at a lower and lower pressure, whose reduced value is slightly less than 0.02 for L . Monte Carlo simulation In order to investigate the thermodynamic behavior of the GCN model at non zero temperatures, we have car ried out a number of MC simulation runs for a GCN system with L , which is the system with the strongest liquid crystalline features that we can still man age numerically. We have effected scans of the phase diagram for six different pressure values, .01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.12, and 0.20. With all probability, FCC001 is the sta ble system phase only in a very small pocket of T P plane nearby the origin. However, we decided not to embark on a free energy study of the relative stability of fluid, FCC001 , and BCC type phases at such low pres sures since this would require a numerical accuracy that is beyond our capabilities. To a first approximation, the boundary line between FCC001 and, say, BCC111 can be assumed to run at constant pressure. For relating data obtained at different pressures, we have carried out two further sequences of MC runs along the isothermal paths for .002 solids and .015 fluid . The Frenkel Ladd computation of the excess Helmholtz free energy per particle fex confirms that the BCC001 , BCC110 , and BCC111 solids are nearly degenerate at low temperature. We take .002, .05 as a reference state for the calculation of solid free energies. With the density fixed at 0.08562D 3, in every case corresponding to .05, we find .461 , 144.470 ,

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0057v2 cond mat.str el 19 Sep 2007 High spin to low spin and orbital polarization transitions in multiorbital Mott systems Philipp Werner and Andrew J. Millis Columbia University, 538 West, 120th Street, New York, NY 10027, USA Dated June 30, 2007 We study the interplay of crystal field splitting and Hund coupling in a two orbital model which captures the essential physics of systems with two electrons or holes in the eg shell. We use single site dynamical mean field theory with a recently developed impurity solver which is able to access strong couplings and low temperatures. The fillings of the orbitals and the location of phase boundaries are computed as a function of Coulomb repulsion, exchange coupling and crystal field splitting. We find that the Hund coupling can drive the system into a novel Mott insulating phase with vanishing orbital susceptibility. Away from half filling, the crystal field splitting can induce an orbital selective Mott state. PACS numbers 71.10.Fd, 71.10.Fd, 71.28. d, 71.30. h The Mott metal insulator transition plays a fundamen tal role in electronic condensed matter physics . Much attention has focused on the one orbital case, in part be cause of its presumed relevance to high temperature su perconductivity and in part because appropriate the oretical tools for the multiorbital case have until recently not been available. In most Mott systems, however, more than one orbital is relevant and the redistribution of electrons among different orbitals leads to new phenom ena such as orbital ordering or orbital selective Mott transitions. Recent studies of nickelates , titanates , cobaltates , manganates , vanadates and ruthenates have focused interest on the in terplay between the Mott metal insulator transition and orbital degeneracy. A fundamental question in this field, relevant in particular to the issue of lattice distortions in strongly correlated materials, is the response of multi orbital systems to a perturbation which breaks the orbital degeneracy. In this paper, we show that a two orbital model with Hund coupling and crystal field splitting ex hibits two fundamentally different Mott phases, one char acterized by a vanishing orbital susceptibility, and one adiabatically connected to the band insulating state. We characterize these phases in terms of the atomic ground states. Multiorbital models are more difficult to study both because of the larger number of degrees of freedom, and because the physically important exchange and pair hopping terms are not easy to treat by standard Hubbard Stratonovich methods . Weak coupling ap proaches have been used to show that exchange and pair hopping interactions act to suppress the response to a crystal field splitting, and some authors have studied the model without exchange and pair hopping terms , but a reliable extension of these results to physically rel evant Slater Kanamori interactions and the strong cou pling regime has been lacking. Dynamical mean field theory DMFT provides a non perturbative and computationally tractable framework to study correlation effects and has allowed insights into the Mott metal insulator transition . In its sin gle site version, DMFT ignores the momentum depen dence of the self energy and reduces the original lat tice problem to the self consistent solution of a quan tum impurity model given by the Hamiltonian . For multi orbital models mc mcm P j,k,l,m U jklmc jckc l cm, where i, denotes both orbital and spin indices, and U jklm some general four fermion interaction. Hhyb and Hbath are the impurity bath mixing and bath Hamiltonians, respec tively. While the DMFT approximation simplifies the problem enormously replacing a 3 1 dimensional field theory by a quantum impurity model plus a self consis tency condition , the extra complications associated with exchange couplings in multiorbital systems have until re cently prohibited extensive numerical work. Interesting progress has been made using a finite temperature exact diagonalization technique , but this approach re quires a truncation of Hbath to a small

Chunk: number of levels. In Refs. we have introduced a continuous time impurity solver which can handle the general interactions in Hloc. The method, which is free from systematic er rors, is based on a diagrammatic expansion of the parti tion function in the impurity bath hybridization Hhyb. Here, we employ this solver to study the physically relevant case in which the number of electrons matches the number of orbitals. The local Hamiltonian is 1,2 X n , X n1, n2, X 1,2 Un , n , X U n1, n2, X U J n1, n2, J 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, h.c. , with the chemical potential, the crystal field split ting, U the intra orbital and U the inter orbital Coulomb interaction, and J the coefficient of the Hund coupling. We adopt the conventional choice of parameters, U 2 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 filling of orbital 1 U t .2 .6 . 1 Filling of orbital 1 as a function of U for .2, 0.6, 1 and several values of J U. The different curves for given correspond from bottom to top to J , , , 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.25, respectively. Open full symbols correspond to metallic insulating solutions. The metal insulator transition is characterized by a jump in filling and a coexistence region where both insulating and metallic solutions exist. Our data show the region of stability of the metallic phase. U 2J, which follows from symmetry considerations for d orbitals in free space and is also assumed to hold in solids. With this choice the Hamiltonian is rotation ally invariant in orbital space and the condition for half filling becomes 1 2 3 2U 5 2J. In the DMFT self consistency loop we use a semi circular density of states of bandwith 4t Bethe lattice . The temperature, unless otherwise noted, is T .02 and we suppress magnetic order by averaging over spin up and down in each orbital. No sign problem is encountered in the simulations. The main result is shown in Fig. 1, which for several values of and J U plots the filling per spin, n1, of or bital 1 as a function of interaction strength. The half filling, non magnetic condition implies . In the T 0 limit, three phases are found a metallic phase which may have any value of n1 between 0 and 0.5 , an orbitally polarized insulator favored by large and small J, and a Mott insulator with . favored by large U, small and large J. If U is increased from zero to a small value, the orbital splitting either increases small J U or decreases large J U , consistent with the findings of Ref. . As interaction strength is further in creased, one of several things may happen at very small J U, n1 continues to decrease, and the system eventually undergoes a transition to an orbitally polarized insulator for large essentially a band insulator . For somewhat larger J U, the occupancy n1, after an initial decrease, goes through a minimum and begins to increase.

Chunk: field splitting. At strong interactions and , the system, in the T 0 limit, is in a phase characterized by a vanishing orbital susceptibil ity, and a spin 1 moment on each site. For . The exchange terms promote insulating behavior . It is interesting to compare our results to recent work on the bilayer Hubbard model . The model which these authors study is equivalent to our model with J, and replaced by the interlayer hopping. In the low energy sector of this model, only four states essentially our three triplets and the pair hopping state 10 are relevant, and what these authors describe as the Mott insulator to band insulator crossover corresponds to our transition apparently sharp at between triplet Mott insulator and orbitally polarized insulator. The existence of two distinct insulating phases raises many interesting questions including the theory of an insulator with strictly vanishing orbital susceptibility which should exhibit an orbital gauge symmetry and the nature and properties of the different metal insulator transitions. The physics near the triple point remains to be studied. Our results away from half filling suggest that lightly doped La2NiO4 is in an orbitally selective Mott phase.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0058v1 physics.pop ph 31 Mar 2007 Intelligent Life in Cosmology Frank J. Tipler Department of Mathematics and Department of Physics Tulane University New Orleans, Louisiana 70118 USA Abstract I shall present three arguments for the proposition that intelligent life is very rare in the universe. First, I shall summarize the consensus opinion of the founders of the Modern Synthesis Simpson, Dobzhanski, and Mayr that the evolution of intelligent life is exceedingly improbable. Second, I shall develop the Fermi Paradox if they existed, theyd be here. Third, I shall show that if intelligent life were too common, it would use up all available resources and die out. But I shall show that the quantum mechanical principle of unitarity actually a form of teleology! requires intelligent life to survive to the end of time. Finally, I shall argue that, if the universe is indeed accelerating, then survival to the end of time requires that intelligent life, though rare, to have evolved several times in the visible universe. I shall argue that the acceleration is a consequence of the excess of matter over antimatter in the universe. I shall suggest experiments to test these claims. Keywords extraterrestrial prokaryotes, extraterrestrial intelligent life, cosmological acceleration, uni tarity, teleology, future of universe, closed universe, black hole evaporation, baryogenesis 1. Introduction Martin Rees is fond of arguing, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. How could anyone disagree? But on the question of the existence of extraterrestrial intelligent life, we have an undeniable fact they aren t here. That is, extraterrestrial intelligent beings are not obviously present on our planet, or in our solar system. I think even Martin will agree with this! But I claim this fact allows us to conclude that extraterrestrial intelligence ETI is absence from our Galaxy and from the Local Group of galaxies. In other words, if they existed, theyd be here! This argument has often been called the Fermi Paradox. I think it is analogous to Olbers Paradox in cosmology, which uses an equally obvious fact, known to all of us the fact that the sky is dark at night to conclude that the universe must have evolved to its present state. The universe cannot have been the same as it appears now for all eternity. I shall outline in Section 2 the reasons that the absence of ETI on Earth allows us to conclude that they don t exist in our galactic neighborhood. I have developed this argument is much more detail elsewhere, addressing all counter arguments that have been proposed. So I shall only outline my argument in Section 2. I shall also only outline the evolutionary argument against ETI here. Mayr, Dobzhanski, Simpson and Ayala have defended this position at length over the past 40 years, and I m sure this argument is quite familiar to the readers of this journal. What I want to develop in this paper is a new argument against the existence of ETI. I shall call it the Limited Resources Argument. It is related to the Fermi Paradox in that it assumes that an intelligent life form will inevitability expand offits planet of origin and once this expansion begins, it will never stop. But if intelligent life were common in the cosmos, the expansion of technological civilization would use up resources so fast that intelligent life would die out. If intelligent life is rare, the speed of light barrier will prevent life from using up the resources too fast. The immediate reaction to this argument is, so what if intelligent life uses up the resources too fast and dies out? Do we have any reason for believing that intelligent has some guarantee for survival that other species do not? Most species that have evolved are now extinct, and have left no descendants. Why should Homo sapiens be any different? There is no evidence from evolutionary biology that intelligence should survive indefinitely.

Chunk: should not couple to right handed electrons, and this can be seen by sending the CMBR through filters consisting of poor conductors. Through such a filter, the CMBR would be more penetrating than thermal radiation of the same temperature. I have shown elsewhere that the same effect is visible in the Sunyaev Zel dovich effect Tipler, 2005 , and it is responsible for the great penetrating power of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays Tipler, 2001, 2005 . Two of the arguments against the existence of ETI have been around for a long time. The evolutionary argument goes back to Alfred Wallace, with Darwin the co discoverer of the principle of natural selection. The Fermi Paradox goes back to Enrico Fermi. I ve added a third, the Limited Resources Argument which connects the rarity of intelligent life in the universe to the unlimited survival of intelligence in the far future. But to appreciate the power of this argument, we must learn to give up anthropocentric ways of thinking. We must abandon the usually tacit idea that our technology exhausts what is possible using the known laws of physics. We must abandon the idea that the universe acts according to human thought patterns, that causality works from past to future. We must abandon the idea that the universe evolves us as the highest level of intelligence, and that all other intelligent species will be as limited in space as we are. Finally, we must abandon the idea that there is a limit to what intelligence can accomplish, and that intelligence will never play a role on the cosmological scale. Once we give up these human ways of thinking, we can appreciate the true relation between intelligent life and the cosmos.

Chunk: But there is evidence from physics for the importance of intelligence life in cosmology. Not of course in the current phase of universal history, but instead near the end of the universe. 1 II. Why Intelligent Life Must Be Rare A. The Improbable Evolution Argument The argument against ETI that most readers of this journal will be familiar with goes back to Alfred Russell Wallace, and has more recently been defended by such major evolutionists as George Gaylord Simp son, Theodosius Dobzhanski, and Ernst Mayr. These scientists point out that according to the Modern Synthesis, evolution has no knowledge of goals. Instead, natural selection acts on random mutations, muta tions which never appear with the intent of achieving a goal in the distant future. There are an enormous number of evolutionary pathways, and so few of these lead to intelligent life, that it is unlikely intelligent life will appear more than once in the visible universe, which is the part of the universe within 13.7 billion light years. The universe is observed to be 13.7 billion years old, and so we cannot see out a distance greater than 13.7 billion light years, the distance light could have traveled in that time. Actually, we can see out a bit further than 13.7 billion light years because of the expansion of the universe, but let me ignore this minor technicality. Even if we were to assume that all the matter and energy in the visible universe were in the form of Earthlike planets, there would be only ! about 1028 Earthlike planets in the visible universe. This number assumes that earthlike means only that the mass of the planet is greater than or equal to the mass of the Earth. No assumption is made about the planet s star, atmosphere, or orbital radius. The well known evolutionist Francisco Ayala has recently made this argument quantitative. He estimates that the probability of an intelligent species evolving on an Earthlike planet upon which one cell organisms have appeared is less than 10 to the minus one million power! This number is so tiny that the evolution of intelligent life is exceedingly unlikely to have occurred even once. Ayala s number is not contradicted by the fact that intelligent life exists on Earth. It is just exceedingly improbable that it exists anywhere in the universe at least if the universe is finite in spatial size, as I shall argue in Section IV that it is . Ayala s number depends on the assumption that gene changes upon which natural selection operates are essentially random. Evolution has no foresight. Mayr has emphasized that intelligence on earth is limited to the chordate lineage, so, he argues that if the chordates never appeared on Earth, neither would intelligence. But chordates first evolved more than half a billion years ago. These animals did not know that they had to evolve so that Homo sapiens would eventually appear. Natural selection can only operate during an animal s lifetime. It cannot select a genome with the intent of using the genome a billion yeas later. There is an important caveat to this a caveat first pointed out by Charles Darwin himself in the last pages of his book The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication. Darwin noted that at the ultimate level of physics, the universe is deterministic. This means that at the ultimate level, there are no random events. In particular, the evolution of Homo sapiens was inevitable, determined by the initial state of the universe and the universes initial conditions. Random variation does not mean uncaused. It just means unpredictable for human beings. Therefore, at this ultimate physical level, Darwin claims that his own theory is only an approximation. Darwin noted that the advance of science might enable us to obtain enough information to predict these random variations. I shall argue below that this time has now come.

Chunk: its expansion phase, as the universe is indeed observed to have. But why should the universe adjust the number of intelligent species so that the descendants of the species would survive to the end of time? As Darwin pointed out in the closing pages of Origin of Species, almost all species that have ever existed on Earth have died out, leaving no descendants. Why should an intelligent life form have a survival probability utterly different from almost all other species? I claim that intelligent life will survive until the end of time because the laws of physics require it. Or to put it another ways, because such survival is one of the goals of the universe. III. Unitarity is Teleology Teleology has been completely rejected by evolutionary biologists. This rejection is unfortunate, because, teleology is alive and well in physics, under the name of unitarity. Unitarity is an absolutely central postulate of quantum mechanics, and it has many consequences. One of these consequences is the CPT theorem, which implies that the g factors of particles and antiparticles must be exactly equal. This equality for electrons and positrons has been verified experimentally to 13 decimal places, the most precise experimental number we have. Which is why very few physicists are willing to give up the postulate of unitarity! Furthermore, unitarity is closely related to the law of conservation of energy, and a violation of unitarity has been shown to result usually in the gigantic creation of energy out of nothing. One model due to Leonard Susskin of unitarity violation had the implication that whenever a microwave oven was turned on, so much energy was created that the Earth was blown apart. So physicists are very reluctant to abandon unitarity. Unitarity is most often applied to what physicists call the S matrix, which is the quantum mechanical linear operator that transforms any state in the ultimate past to a unique state in the ultimate future. But unitarity more generally applies to the time evolution operator, a linear operator that carries the quantum state of the universe at any initial time uniquely into the quantum state of the universe at any chosen future time. Uniquely is a key word. It means that unitarity is the quantum mechanical version of determinism. Contrary to what is generally thought, determinism is alive and well in quantum mechanics. Determinism, however, applies to wave functions quantum states rather than to individual particles. Alternatively, we can say that determinism applies to coherent collections of worlds rather than to individuals. There is a sense, which I won t have room to discuss here, in which quantum mechanics is more deterministic than classical mechanics, and that Schr odinger derived his famous equation by requiring that classical mechanics in it most general expression Hamilton Jacobi theory be deterministic. See Tipler for the mathematical details. But the usual past to future determinism is not the fundamental meaning of unitarity. What unitarity really means is that the inverse of the time evolution operator exists, and is easily computed from the time evolution operator itself by forming the time evolution operator s hermitian conjugate. Any operator whose inverse is obtained in this manner is said to be a unitary operator. But in the present context, the important point is that the inverse of the time evolution operator exists. The inverse of any operator is an operator that undoes the effect of the original operator. In the case of the time evolution operator, which generates past to future evolution, the inverse operator generates future to past evolution. In other words, it carries future quantum states uniquely into past quantum states. Therefore, unitarity tells us that any complete statement of usual past to future causation is mathematically equivalent to some complete statement of future to past causation. In more traditional language, a complete list of all efficient causes is equivalent to some complete list of final causes.

Chunk: Teleology is reborn! 4 Nevertheless, the Second Law of Thermodynamics says that the complexity of the universe at the microlevel is increasing with time. This means that it will usually be the case that past to future causation will be the simpler explanation of the two causal languages. But this will not always be the case. We should always remember that for physical reality the two causation languages are mathematically equivalent. It might occasionally be the case that we humans can understand where the evolution of the universe is taking us only by using future to past causation. That is, we can understand what is happening now only by considering the ultimate goal of the universe. To reject this possibility is a terrible mistake. Humans naturally think in terms of past to future causation because our memories are designed by the laws of physics to work in this time direction. But the universe is not similarly restricted. It is a mistake to impose human limitations on the physical universe. It was a terrible mistake to require that solar system mechanics look simple in a geocentric frame of reference. Let me now use this future to past causation to show that biological evolution cannot be completely random. I shall now argue that the laws of physics require intelligent life to evolve somewhere, and survive to the very end of time. IV. Why Intelligent Life MUST Exist in the Far Future The necessity of intelligent life in the far future is an automatic consequence of the laws of physics, specifically quantum mechanics, general relativity, the Standard Model of particle physics, and most impor tantly, the Second Law of Thermodynamics. I shall show that the mutual consistency of these laws requires three things. First, the universe must be closed the universe s spatial topology must be a three sphere . Second, life must survive to the very end of time. Third, the knowledge possessed by life must increase to infinity as the end of time is approached. I do not assume life survives to the end of time. Life s survival follows from the laws of physics. If the laws of physics be for us, who can be against us? But before I prove that the laws of physics require life to survive, let me first show that it is possible for life to survive. To survive for infinite experiential time, life requires an unlimited supply of energy. That is, the supply of available energy must diverge to infinity as the end of time is approached. Nevertheless, conservation of energy requires the total energy of the universe to be constant. In fact, Roger Penrose has shown that the total energy of any closed universe is ZERO! The total energy is zero now, was zero in the past, and will be zero at all times in the future. One might wonder how this is possible. After all, we are now receiving energy from the Sun, we are using food energy as we read this, and we can extract energy from coal, oil, and uranium. Energy, in other words, seems to be non zero. However, the forms of energy just listed are not all the forms of energy in the universe. There is also gravitational energy, which is negative. So if we were to add all the positive forms of energy radiant energy, the stored energy in coal, oil, and uranium, and most importantly, the mass energy of matter to the negative gravitational energy, the sum is zero. This means that if we can make the gravitational energy even more negative, the positive energy, that is, the energy available for life, necessarily increases, even though the total energy in the universe stays zero. The key property of energy that must always be kept in mind is that it transforms from one form to another. Once we realize that gravitational energy can transformed into available energy,

Chunk: correct cosmological theory must be consistent with these observations. The Standard Model, minimally coupled to gravity, necessarily has a positive cosmological constant. I predicted in my book Tipler, 1994 that this cosmological constant would cause the universe to undergo an acceleration. I argued that this acceleration would occur in the collapsing phase of universal history. I did not realize that an acceleration could also occur in the expanding phase. Though I should have, since the Standard Model requires such an acceleration. The Standard Model requires a positive cosmological constant to cancel the effect of the Higgs vacuum. Recall that according to the Standard Model, the universe is permeated with a non zero value of the Higgs field, and it is this non zero value that breaks the electroweak symmetry and gives mass to all the particles. But this symmetry breaking is accomplished via the Higgs potential, which for constant Higgs field, acts exactly a very strong negative cosmological constant. Initially, at the Big Bang singularity, the Higgs field, and hence the Higgs potential, was zero. But zero is not the lowest value of the potential, so as the universe expanded, the Higgs potential dropped to its lowest value, corresponding to a negative cosmological constant. Now in special relativity, this negative constant can be re normalized out of existence. Not so in general relativity. Any constant in the matter Lagrangian multiples the invariant volume element, and is equivalent to putting in a cosmological constant in the Lagrangian Weinberg, 1988 . The value of the negative cosmological constant corresponding to the Higgs potential can be set by experiment, and it is enormous 1.0 1026 gm cm3, as compared to the energy density of the dark matter and dark energy, only 10 29 gm cm3. The only way to make the Standard Model consistent with general relativity is to add a positive cosmological constant of the same magnitude to the Lagrangian. We would expect the value of the added positive cosmological constant to precisely cancel the value of the Higgs potential, when the Higgs is in its true ground state the absolute lowest energy density of the potential . But the Higgs field cannot presently be in its true ground state, for a very simple reason there is more matter than antimatter in the universe. The Standard Model has a mechanism of generating this observed excess of matter over antimatter, but most cosmologists believe that this cannot be the main mechanism to generate matter, because they think, incorrectly, that it will generate too many photons to baryons. I have shown that this large number of photons to baryons is a consequence of imposing the wrong boundary conditions in the very early universe. If the only boundary conditions consistent with the Bekenstein Bound a.k.a. quantum field theory are imposed, the photon to baryon ratio turns out fine. The Standard Model generation of matter works by electroweak vacuum tunneling. And if this tunneling yields an excess of matter over antimatter, the Higgs field cannot be in its true vacuum. Thus the excess of matter over antimatter in the universe ultimately causes the observed acceleration of the universe! Conversely, if the excess of matter over antimatter were to disappear if matter were converted into energy via electroweak tunneling and if this disappearance were to occur rapidly enough, then the Higgs potential would fall toward its true ground state, the positive cosmological constant would be progressively cancelled, and the universe would cease to accelerate. If he universe were a spatially a three sphere and I have argued in the previous section that it is then once the acceleration stops, the universe will expand to a maximum size, and then recollapse into the final singularity. Provided, of course, than a mechanism can be found to convert matter into energy via electrweak quantum tunneling. The mechanism would have to be the inverse of the process that created the matter

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0059v2 astro ph 9 Apr 2007 THE MASS AND RADIUS OF THE UNSEEN M DWARF COMPANION IN THE SINGLE LINED ECLIPSING BINARY HAT TR 205 013 Thomas G. Beatty1, Jos e M. Fern andez2,3, David W. Latham2, G asp ar A. Bakos2,4, G eza Kov acs5, Robert W. Noyes2, Robert P. Stefanik2, Guillermo Torres2, Mark E. Everett6, Carl W. Hergenrother7,2 dlatham cfa.harvard.edu ABSTRACT We derive masses and radii for both components in the single lined eclipsing binary HAT TR 205 013, which consists of a F7V primary and a late M dwarf secondary. The system s period is short, .230736 0.000010 days, with an orbit indistinguishable from circular, .012 0.021. We demonstrate generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single lined binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique line in the mass radius diagram with M . For HAT TR 205 013, we assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary s rotation has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line broadening, Vrot sin .9 1.0 km s 1, gives a primary radius of .28 0.04 R . Our light curve analysis leads to the radius of the secondary, .167 0.006 R , and the semimajor axis of the orbit, .54 0.30 .0351 0.0014 AU. Our single lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the individual masses, .124 0.010 M and .04 0.13 M . Our result for HAT TR 205 013 B lies above the theoretical mass radius models from 1Department of Astronomy, Harvard University, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138 2Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138 3Department of Astronomy, Pontificia Universidad Cat olica, Casilla 306, Santiago 22, Chile 4Hubble Fellow 5Konkoly Observatory, Budapest, P.O.

The method we describe offers the opportunity to study the very low end of the stellar mass radius relation. Subject headings binaries eclipsing binaries spectroscopic stars funda mental parameters stars low mass stars rotation 1. INTRODUCTION Solving for the masses and radii of stars has traditionally been accomplished through the analysis of double lined eclipsing binaries, where the light of both components is detected. Masses and radii determined this way are fundamental and can be very accurate, because they rely only on Newton s laws and geometry for the analysis of the spectroscopic orbit and light curve, and not on models of stellar structure and evolution. In particular, analysis of the eclipse light curve yields the orbital inclination, and when combined with the double lined spectroscopic orbit, this yields individual masses for both stars. There are dozens of double lined eclipsing binaries with very accurate mass and ra dius determinations e.g. see Andersen 1991, for a review , but only 10 M dwarfs in 5 systems with accuracies better than 3 percent. In order of increasing mass, the 5 systems are CM Draconis Lacy 1977 Metcalfe et al. 1995 , UX Ursae Majoris Torres et al. 2003, SZ Fornacis Rebolo et al. 1993, WX UMa Fadylov et al. 2002, and now HAT TR 205 013, Beatty et al. 2007 . The mass radii relation is known to be critical to many areas of astrophysics, e.g., the early evolution of low mass stars, the occurrence of planets, the space density, and dynamics of brown dwarfs, and the statistics of white dwarf cooling, but there are very few mass radii determinations available for the lowest mass stars, the coolest brown dwarfs, and very low mass white dwarfs. However, the traditional requirements for analyzing double lined eclipsing binaries are difficult to meet for the classes of objects mentioned above. First, the need to resolve both stars generally requires much higher photometric and spectroscopic precision than is available for, e.g., most brown dwarfs. Second, if the lower mass companion is a brown dwarf or a very low mass white dwarf,

Chunk: the substellar limit near 0.075 M . Recently, however, the growing number of short period single lined eclipsing binaries with F and G star primaries and M dwarf secondaries identified by wide angle photometric surveys for transiting planet promises to provide a way to fill in this gap in the mass radius diagram Bouchy et al. 2005 Pont et al. 2005a,b, 2006 . One approach to using a single lined eclipsing binary to solve for the mass and radius of the unseen companion is to use stellar models together with spectroscopic and photometric observations of the primary to estimate its mass and radius. Then the radius ratio from the light curve yields the radius of the secondary, and the mass function from the spectroscopic orbit with the orbital inclination from the light curve can be combined to yield the mass of 3 the secondary. However, this approach is not fundamental, because it relies on stellar models to characterize the primary. Tests of the mass radius relation with the low mass secondaries in such systems are no better than the validity of the models for the primaries. In particular, the theoretical isochrones depend on metallicity, and significant errors can result if the wrong metallicity is adopted. An alternative, and more fundamental, approach relies on the expectation that short period binaries whose orbits have been circularized by tidal mechanisms must also have the axial rotation of both stars synchronized to the orbital period, and both rotational axes aligned with the normal to the orbit, so that the two inclinations are equal, e.g. see Hut 1981 Zahn 1989 . In this case, a measurement of the spectral line broadening due to rotation, Vrot sin irot, combined with a value for iorb from an analysis of the light curve, yields the actual equatorial rotational velocity, Vrot. If the rotation is synchronized with the orbit, then , and the radius of the primary can be solved. The key to this approach is the ability to derive accurate values for the rotational broadening of the spectral lines, because the primary radius can be no more accurate than the value derived for Vrot. The radius of the primary then sets the scale for the rest of the system, yielding the radius of the secondary and the semi major axis of the orbit in actual length units, as well as the orbital inclination. Then Newton s revised version of Kepler s Third Law can be used to derive the sum of the masses, and the mass function from the single lined spectroscopic orbit allows the individual masses to be determined. This approach depends on the predictions from stellar models only in minor ways limb darkening coefficients are needed for the detailed analysis of the eclipse light curve, and the rotational broadening that is derived from the observed spectra can depend weakly on the metallicity that is adopted. The advantage of using single lined eclipsing binaries is that it dramatically increases the number of low mass stars whose masses and radii can be determined. Indeed, over the past 30 years only seven double lined eclipsing systems composed of low mass stars have been identified the aforementioned CM Dra, CU Cnc, NSVS01031772, YY Gem, and GU Boo, plus OGLE BW3 V38 Maceroni Montalb an 2004 , and TrES Her0 07621 Creevey et al. 2005 . Meanwhile, more than 75 single lined eclipsing binaries with M dwarf secondaries have been discovered by wide angle photometric transiting planet surveys such as Vulcan, TrES, and HAT in just the last five years Latham 2007 . Increasing the number of low mass stars with fundamental determinations of masses and radii is worthwhile because of the insights these systems can yield into stellar structure. Low mass stars near the hydrogen burning limit are cool enough that their interior temperatures are on the order of the electron Fermi temperature Chabrier Baraffe 1997 , causing parts of

Chunk: Astronomy, Inc., under contract with the National Science Foundation. 8 be good to perhaps 0.2 km s 1. Unfortunately we do not yet have a direct measure of the metallicity of HAT TR 205 013, but the fact that the templates with Fe H 0.0 give a better match to the observed spectra than the templates with Fe H 0.5 suggests that the metallicity is probably within 0.5 dex of solar. In the absence of an accurate metallicity we adopt a value of Fe H 0.2, which is typical of the solar neighborhood Nordstr om et al. 2004 . The temperature corresponding to this metallicity that we derive from our spectra is , but with a systematic error that could exceed 200 K because of the degeneracy between temperature and metallicity in the analysis of our spectra. The alternative approach of deriving a temperature from photometric indices is hampered by the lack of accurate photometry and the possibility that there may be significant reddening. The distance that we derive from the Stefan Boltzmann law using .27 0.04 R , 200 K, .729 0.048 which corresponds to .67 0.05 , and bolometric .011 Flower 1996 is 232 18 pc. From our spectroscopic temperature and log g, we estimate the spectral type of the primary to be F7V Cox 2000 . Thus our experiments with different gravities and metallicities suggest that the system atic errors due to uncertainties in the template parameters may be less than 0.4 km s 1. When combined in quadrature with the internal precision estimate of 0.3 km s 1, this sug gests that the total error in our final interpolated rotational velocity could be as small as 0.5 km s 1. Previous experience however, would indicate that the actual uncertainty is higher than this internal estimate. Therefore, to be conservative we adopt an uncertainty of 1.0 km s 1 and use Vrot sin .9 1.0 km s 1 for our determination of the radius of the primary and subsequent analysis. One could also determine the value of Vrot sin irot by spectroscopically measuring the amplitude of the Rossiter McLaughlin Effect during eclipse Gaudi Winn 2007 . In the case of HAT TR 205 013 the amplitude of this effect would be about 0.5 km s 1, too small to be measured with the CfA Digital Speedometers, but potentially observable with an accuracy of a few percent by instruments such as HIRES on Keck 1. Our approach relies on the assumption that the stellar rotation has been synchronized to the orbital period. One way to test this assumption might be to use very precise photometry to derive a rotational period for the star. We did look for sinusoidal variations in the HAT photometry but did not find anything significant near the orbital period. We did detect a marginally significant variation with half the orbital period and amplitude of about 1 mmag, which is consistent with the the expected ellipsoidal deformation of the primary star. A second, more global test would be to use stellar models to estimate the mass and radius of the primary, but a prerequisite for such an analysis would be accurate determinations of the temperature and metallicity, presumably from high quality spectra, and such results are not 9 yet available. 2.3. Follow up KeplerCam Photometry To provide a high quality light curve for the analysis of the primary eclipse of HAT TR 205 013 we used KeplerCam on the 1.2 m telescope at the Fred L. Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins, Arizona. KeplerCam utilizes a monolithic 4K 4K Fairchild 486 CCD that provides a 23 field and a pixel size of 0.34 . We used the predicted eclipse times from our spectroscopic orbit to schedule observations on the night of 22 23 October 2005. We successfully observed a full eclipse, alternating between the Sloan g and i bands. The seeing was approximately 2 FWHM throughout

Chunk: the night, but we deliberately defocused the telescope to get images with 3 FWHM in order to keep the peak counts in the images well below saturation. Over the course of the observations the focus of the telescope, which depends weakly on temperature, was adjusted three times to keep the image size near 3 FWHM. Because we used automatic guiding, the centroid of the images moved less than 3 pixels over the duration of the observations. For readout we binned the pixels 2 2, which gave a total readout time including overhead of 12 seconds. Exposure times were 30 seconds for the g band and 10 seconds for the i band. The images were obtained in sequences of 3 g band exposures followed by 6 i band exposures. All told, we were able to collect a total of 297 images in the g band and 588 in the i band. Some thin cirrus clouds were present at the beginning of the night, with no noticeable degradation of the light curves. A quarter Moon rose during the observations after the end of egress, and this contributed to a slight increase in photometric scatter after egress. All the images were reduced by applying an overscan correction and then subtracting the two dimensional residual bias pattern. After correcting for shutter effects, we flattened each image using a normalized set of combined twilight images. To produce the light curve, we used the first image from each filter in an observing sequence as our astrometric reference for identifying the same stars in subsequent images. We then determined the relative shift between images to relocate each star in the following images. We measured the flux of each star in a 6.7 circular aperture around the position derived from the astrometric fit using daophot phot within IRAF Tody 1986, 1993 . We estimated the sky in an annulus around each star with inner and outer radii of 9.4 and 13.4 using the sigma rejection mode. We iteratively selected comparison stars by removing any that showed unusual noise or variability in their differential light curves, obtaining 21 comparison stars for the g band and 37 for the i band. Based on a weighted mean flux from the comparison stars, we calculated 10 an extinction correction, and then applied this to each comparison star. The typical rms residual for both bands was 1.5 mmag, a value that increased slightly toward the end of the night due to the increased sky brightness from the rising Moon. The main contributor of noise to the photometry from individual images was atmospheric scintillation, which accounted for over 65 of our calculated rms Young 1967 . The individual photometric measurements in the g and i bands are reported in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. 3. LIGHT CURVE ANALYSIS Our KeplerCam light curves for HAT TR 205 013 give good coverage of the eclipse centered at HJD 2453666.747 0.001, with more than two hours of coverage both before the start of ingress and after the end of egress. The eclipse itself lasts about 3 hours between first and fourth contact and is about 2 percent deep, in agreement with the discovery light curve from HAT. Our KeplerCam light curves clearly show the effects of limb darkening on eclipse shape as a function of wavelength the i band light curve is slightly shallower and possesses a flatter bottom than the g band curve.

The authors of the study investigate the highly eccentric planet WASP-12b using transit photometry data, which reveals strong evidence of tidal dissipation affecting the planet's orbit. They begin by discussing the basic properties of the system, highlighting the planet's short period (less than one Earth year) and highly eccentric orbit (e ˜0.8), which lead to extreme changes in the planet's orbital velocity and temperature as it approaches and recedes from its host star.

Rapisarda2,3 1 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee 37996, USA 2 Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Sezione di Catania, via Santa Sofia 64, I 95123, Catania, Italy 3 Dipartimento di Fisica e Astronomia, Universit a Catania, via Santa Sofia 64, I 95123, Catania, Italy Abstract We investigate the Coulomb excitation of low lying states of unstable nuclei in intermediate energy collisions Elab 10 500 MeV nucleon . It is shown that the cross sections for the E1 and E2 transitions are larger at lower energies, much less than 10 MeV nucleon. Retardation effects and Coulomb distortion are found to be both relevant for energies as low as 10 MeV nucleon and as high as 500 MeV nucleon. Implications for studies at radioactive beam facilities are discussed. PACS numbers 25.60. t, 25.70. z, 25.70.De Keywords Coulomb excitation, cross sections, unstable nuclei. bertulanica ornl.gov. 1 Unstable nuclei are often studied with reactions induced by secondary radioactive beams. Examples of these reactions are elastic scattering, fragmentation and Coulomb excitation by heavy targets. Coulomb excitation is specially useful since the interaction mechanism is very well known . It is the result of electromagnetic interactions of a projectile ZP,AP with a target ZT,AT . One of the participating nuclei is excited as it passes through the electromagnetic field of the other. Here we will only consider the excitation of the pro jectile as is of interest in studies carried out in heavy ion facilities around the world, e.g. LNS Catania, NSCL MSU, GSI, GANIL, RIKEN, etc. In Coulomb excitation a virtual pho ton with energy E is absorbed by the projectile. Because in pure Coulomb excitation the participating nuclei stay outside the range of the nuclear strong force, the excitation cross section can be expressed in terms of the same multipole matrix elements that character ize excited state gamma ray decay, or the reduced transition probabilities, B Ji Jf . Hence, Coulomb excitation amplitudes are strongly coupled with valuable nuclear struc ture information. Therefore, this mechanism has been used for many years to study the electromagnetic properties of low lying nuclear states . Coulomb excitation cross sections are large if the adiabacity parameter satisfies the con dition fi a0 , where a0 is half the distance of closest approach in a head on collision for a projectile velocity v, and fi is the excitation energy. This adiabatic cut offlimits the possible excitation energies below 1 2 MeV in sub barrier collisions. A possible way to overcome this limitation, and to excite high lying states, is to use higher projectile energies. In this case, the closest approach distance, at which the nuclei still interact only electromagnetically, is of order of the sum of the nuclear radii, , where P refers to the projectile and T to the target. For very high energies one has also to take into account the Lorentz contraction of the interaction time by means of the Lorentz factor 1 v2 c2 1 2, with c being the speed of light. For such collisions the adiabacity condition, Eq. , becomes R fiR . From this relation one obtains that for bombarding energies around and above 100 MeV nucleon, states with energy up to 10 20 MeV can be readily excited . An appropriate description of Coulomb excitation at intermediate energies has been described in ref. . In this energy region neither the non relativistic Coulomb excitation formalism described in ref. , nor the relativistic one formulated in refs. are appropriate. This is discussed in details in ref. where it is shown that the use of the non relativistic formalism, even though very simple and handy, leads to rather poor agreement with experimental data for nuclei such as Pb and Bi, and some of their isotopes. At the same time it is observed that the use of the relativistic formalism can describe the experimental data remarkably well. By the way, it could be of interest to stress that the only source of disagreement between the theory and the experiment is the use of the non-relativistic formalism for the description of the Coulomb excitation at intermediate energies, and not the formalism used for the calculation of the strong forces, which shows a satisfactory agreement. It is therefore quite relevant to revisit the use of the non-relativistic description of Coulomb excitation in this energy range. The relativistic formalism should be adopted instead.

Chunk: sections, gamma ray angular distributions, etc. . We follow the formalism of ref. to calculate cross sections for Coulomb excitation from energies varying from 10 to 500 MeV nucleon. These are the energies where most radioactive beam facilities are or will be operating around the world. The calculated cross sections will be of useful guide for future experiments. We also compare the accurate calculations with those obtained by using simple analytical formulas and test the regime of their validity. The cross sections for the transition Ji Jf in the projectile are calculated using the equation d i f d 4 2Z2 Te2 2 a2o 4 X B , Ji Jf 2 1 3 S , 2 , where E or M stands for the electric or magnetic multipolarity, and B , Ji Jf 1 2Ji 1 2 are the reduced transition probabilities. In these equations, o 1 sin 2 , with being the deflection angle, a0 . The complex functions S , are integrals along Coulomb trajectories corrected for retardation. Their calculation and how they relate to the non relativistic and relativistic theories are described in details in ref. . Here we will introduce another comparison tool for the total cross section, which is obtained by integration of eq. 3 over scattering angles. The code COULINT was used to calculate the orbital integrals S , and the cross sections of eq. 3 for more details, see ref. . Using the theory described in ref. , it is easy to show that approximate values of the cross sections for E1, E2, and M1 transitions can be obtained by means of the relations app 2 9 Z2 T c B E1 c v 2 K0K1 v2 2 2c2 K2 1 K2 0 app 2 75 Z2 T c 3E3 xB E2 c v 4 2 2K2 1 1 1 2 2 K0K1 v4 2 2c4 K2 1 K2 0 app 2 9 Z2 T c B M1 K0K1 2 2 K2 1 K2 0 , 3 where Kn are the modified Bessel functions of the second order, as a function of given by eq. 2, with R corrected for recoil by the modification R R a 2 . Here we will only consider the excitation of the lowest lying states in light and medium heavy nuclei. For nuclear masses , the TUNL nuclear data evaluation web site was of great help . The electromagnetic transition rates at the TUNL database are given in Weisskopf units and are transformed to the appropriate B , Ii If values by means of the standard Weisskopf relations BW E1 Ji Jgs 0.06446A2 3 e2fm2, BW E2 Ji Jgs 0.05940A4 3 e2fm4, and BW M1 Ji Jgs 1.79 e 2mnc 2. For comparison, a few medium mass nuclei, as well as a few stable nuclei, were included in the calculation. Other data were taken from refs. . Some cases of nuclei far from the stability line are very interesting and deserve further study, possibly using the method of Coulomb excitation. For example, it is well known that nuclei with open shells tend to have B E2 values greater than 10 W.u., whereas nuclei with shell closure of neutrons or protons tend to have distinctly smaller B E2 values. Typical examples of the latter category are the doubly magic nuclei, 16O and 48Ca, which B E2 values are 3.17 and 1.58 W.u., respectively.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0062v1 cs.DS 31 Mar 2007 On line Viterbi Algorithm and Its Relationship to Random Walks Rastislav Sr amek1, Bro na Brejov a2, and Tom a s Vina r2 1 Department of Computer Science, Comenius University, 842 48 Bratislava, Slovakia, e mail rasto ksp.sk 2 Department of Biological Statistics and Computational Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA, e mail cornell.edu Abstract. In this paper, we introduce the on line Viterbi algorithm for decoding hidden Markov models HMMs in much smaller than linear space. Our analysis on two state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode sequence of length n with m state HMM can be as low as m log n , without a significant slow down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm. Classical Viterbi algorithm requires O mn space, which is impractical for analysis of long DNA sequences such as complete human genome chromosomes and for continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance of the on line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both simulated and real DNA sequences. Keywords hidden Markov models, on line algorithms, Viterbi algorithm, gene finding 1 Introduction Hidden Markov models HMMs are generative probabilistic models that have been succesfuly used for annotation of sequence data, such as DNA and protein sequences, natural langauge texts, and sequences of observations or measurements. Their numerous applications include gene finding , protein secondary structure prediction , and speech recognition . The linear time Viterbi algorithm is the most commonly used algorithm for these tasks. Unfortunately, the space required by the Viterbi algorithm grows linearly with the length of the sequence with a high constant factor , which makes it unsuitable for analysis of continuous or very long sequences. For example, DNA sequence of a single chromosome can be hundreds of megabases long. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing an on line Viterbi algorithm that on average requires much less memory and that can annotate continuous streams of data on line without reading the complete input sequence first. An HMM, composed of states and transitions, is a probabilistic model that generates sequences over a given alphabet. In each step of this generative process, the current state generates one symbol of the sequence according to the emission probabilities associated with that state. Then, an outgoing transition is randomly chosen according to the transition probability table, and this transition is followed to the new state. This process is repeated until the whole sequence is generated. The states in the HMM represent distinct features of the observed sequences such as protein coding and non coding sequences in a genome , and the emission probabilities in each state represent statistical properties of these features. The HMM thus defines a joint probability Pr X, S over all possible sequences X and all state paths S through the HMM that could generate these sequences. To annotate a given sequence X, we want to recover the state path S that maximizes this joint probability. For example, in an HMM with one state for protein coding sequences, and one state for non coding sequences, the most probable state path marks each symbol of the input sequence X as either protein coding or non coding. To compute the most probable state path, we use the Viterbi dynamic programming algorithm . For every prefix X1 . . . Xi of the given sequence X and for every state j, we compute the most probable state path generating this prefix ending in state j. We store the probability of this path in table P i, j and its second last state in table B i, j . These values can be computed from left to right, using the recurrence P i, j maxk , where tk j is the transition probability from state k to state j, and ej Xi is the emission probability of the i

Chunk: We conjecture that this trend extends to more complex cases. We also present experimental results on a gene finding HMM and real DNA sequences showing that the on line Viterbi algorithm leads to significant savings in memory. Another advantage of our algorithm is that it can construct initial segments of the most probable state path before the whole input sequence is read. This feature makes it ideal for on line processing of signal streams such as sensor readings . 3 Memory requirements of the on line Viterbi algorithm In this section, we analyze the memory requirements of the on line Viterbi algorithm. The memory used by the algorithm is variable throughout the execution of the algorithm, but of special interest are asymptotic bounds on the expected maximum amount of memory used by the algorithm while decoding a sequence of length n. We use analogy to random walks and results in extreme value theory to argue that for a symmet ric two state HMMs, the expected maximum memory is m log n . We also conduct experiments on an HMM for gene finding, and both real and simulated DNA sequences. 3.1 Symmetric two state HMMs Consider a two state HMM over a binary alphabet as shown in Figure 2a. For simplicity, we assume 1 2. The back pointers between the sequence positions i and i 1 can form one of the configurations i iii shown in Figure 2b. Denote i, A and i, B , where P i, j is the table of probabilities from the Viterbi algorithm. The recurrence used in the Viterbi algorithm implies that the configuration i occurs when log t log 1 t pA pB log 1 t log t, configuration ii occurs when pA pB log 1 t log t, and configuration iii occurs when pA pB log t log 1 t . Configuration iv never happens for . Note that for a two state HMM, a coalescence point occurs whenever one of the configurations ii or iii occur. Thus the memory used by the HMM is proportional to the length of continuous sequence of configurations i. We will call such a sequence of configurations a run. First, we analyze the length distribution of runs under the assumption that the input sequence X is a sequence of uniform i.i.d. binary random variables. In such case, we represent the run by a symmetric random walk corresponding to a random variable 1 e log e log t log 1 t . Whenever this variable is within the interval 0, K , where 1 t log t log 1 e log e m , the configuration i occurs, and the quantity pA pB is updated by log 1 e log e, if the symbol at the corresponding sequence position is 0, or log e log 1 e , if this symbol is 1. These shifts correspond to updating the value of X by 1 or 1. When X reaches 0, we have a coalescence point in configuration iii, and the pA pB is initialized to log t log 1 t log e log 1 e , which either means initialization of X to 1, or another 4 0 1 e 1 e A B 1 t 1 t 0 e 1 1 e t configuration i A B A B A B A B configuration ii configuration iii configuration iv a b t Fig. 2. a Symmetric two state HMM with two parameters e for emission probabilities and t for transitions probabilities. b Possible back pointer configurations for the two state HMM. coalescence point, depending on the symbol at the corresponding sequence position. The other case, when X reaches K and we have a coalescence point in configuration ii, is symmetric. We can now apply the classical results from the theory of random walks see 11, ch.14.3,14.5 to analyze the expected length of runs. Lemma 1. Assuming that the

Chunk: representing the state paths under consideration of the dynamic programming algorithm. The algorithm requires variable space that depends on the HMM and on the local properties of the analyzed sequence. For two state symmetric HMMs, we have shown that the expected maximum memory used for analysis of sequence of length n is approximately only 2K2 2 ln n. Our experiments on both simulated and real data suggest that the asymptotic bound m ln n also extend to multi state HMMs, and in fact, for most of the time throughout the execution of the algorithm, much less memory is used. Further advantage of our algorithm is that it can be used for on line processing of streamed sequences all previous algorithms that are guaranteed to produce the optimal state path require the whole sequence to be read before the output can be started. There are still many open problems. We have only been able to analyze the algorithm for two state HMMs, though trends predicted by our analysis seem to generalize even to more complex cases. Can our analysis be extended to multi state HMMs? Apparently, design of the HMM affects the memory needed for the decoding algorithm for example, presence of states with similar emission probabilities tends to increase memory requirements. Is it possible to characterize HMMs that require large amounts of memory to decode? Can we characterize the states that are likely to serve as coalescence points? Acknowledgments Authors would like to thank Richard Durrett for useful discussions. Recently, we have found out that parallel work on this problem is also performed by another research group . Focus of their work is on implementation of an algorithm similar to our on line Viterbi algorithm in their gene finder, and possible applications to parallelization, while we focus on the expected space analysis.

Chunk: 1 Experimental efforts in search of 76Ge Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay Somnath Choudhury Department of Physics Meteorology Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur 721302, India Abstract Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches in non accelerator particle physics to take us into a regime of physics beyond the standard model. This article is a brief review of the experiments in search of neutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge. Following a brief introduction of the process of double beta decay from 76Ge, the results of the very first experiments IGEX and Heidelberg Moscow which give indications of the existence of possible neutrinoless double beta decay mode has been reviewed. Then ongoing efforts to substantiate the early findings are presented and the Majorana experiment as a future experimental approach which will allow a very detailed study of the 0 decay mode is discussed. Keywords neutrinoless, Majorana particle, pulse shape discrimination. 1. Introduction Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches with great perspectives to test particle physics beyond the Standard Model. There is immense scope to use 0 decay for constraining neutrino masses, left right symmetric models, interactions involving R parity breaking in the supersymmetric model and leptoquark scenarios, as well as effective lepton number violating couplings. Experimental limits on 0 decay are not only complementary to accelerator experiments but at least in some cases competitive or superior to the best existing direct search limits. The steadily improving experimental limits on the half life of 0 can be translated into more stringent limits on the parameters of these new physics scenarios. In the process of beta decay an unstable nucleus decays by converting a neutron in the nucleus to a proton and emitting an electron and an anti neutrino. In order for beta decay to be possible the final nucleus must have a larger binding energy than the original nucleus. For some nuclei, such as Germanium 76 the nuclei with atomic number one higher have a smaller binding energy, preventing beta decay from occurring. In the case of Germanium 76 the nuclei with atomic number two higher, Selenium 76 has a larger binding energy, so the double beta decay process is allowed. In double beta decay two neutrons in the nuclei are converted to protons, and two electrons and two anti neutrinos are emitted. It is the rarest known kind of radioactive decay it was observed for only ten isotopes. For some nuclei, the process occurs as conversion of two protons to neutrons, with emission of two neutrinos and absorption of two orbital electrons double electron capture . If mass difference between the parent and daughter atoms is more than 1022 keV two electron masses , another branch of the process becomes possible, with capture of one orbital electron and emission of one positron. And, at last, when the mass difference is more then 2044 keV four electron masses , the third branch of the decay arises, with emission of two positrons decay . The processes described above are also known as two neutrino double beta decay, as two neutrinos or anti neutrinos are emitted. If the neutrino is a Majorana particle, meaning that the anti neutrino and the neutrino are actually the same particle then it is possible for neutrinoless double beta decay to occur. In 0 decay the emitted neutrino is immediately absorbed as its anti particle by another nucleon of the nucleus, so the total kinetic energy of the two electrons would be exactly the difference in binding energy between the initial and final state nuclei. Now at Indiana University Bloomington, USA Experiments have been carried out and proposed to search for 0 decay mode, as its discovery would indicate that neutrinos are indeed Majorana particles and allow a calculation of neutrino mass. While the two neutrino mode is allowed by the Standard Model of particle physics, the neutrinoless mode 0 requires violation

Chunk: site double escape peak at 1592.47 keV. The PSD discriminator was then calibrated to the properties of the double escape peak A slightly improved double escape peak was be made from the 26Al gamma ray of 2938.22 keV. The double escape appears at 1916.22 keV, only about 120 keV away from the expected region of interest for 0 decay. The obvious and direct use of pulse shape discrimination and segmentation is the rejection of cosmogenic pulses in the germanium itself. However, the approach should be also effective on gamma rays from the shielding and structural materials. The background effects of neutrons of both high energy cosmic muon generated and low energy fission and ,n from rock could be protected by the segmentation and granularity of the detectors. These neutrons could also produce other unwanted activities like the formation of 3H and 14C in nitrogen from high and low energy neutrons, respectively. Fortunately, Majorana detectors will not be surrounded by nitrogen at high density. d S The GERDA GERmanium Detector Assembly , which is another next generation 76Ge double beta decay experiment at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory, has projected a sensitivity in the half life of the 0 decay mode which is less than the proposed Majorana experiment. In conclusion, the Majorana project has been designed in a compact, modular way such that it can be built and operated with high confidence in the approach and the technology. The initial years of construction will allow alternate cooling methods to be employed if they have an advantage and should they be shown to overcome long term concerns due to surface contamination, muon induced ions, and diffusion. The Majorana Collaboration has made an extensive analysis of the predicted backgrounds and their impact on the final sensitivity of the experiment. The Majorana experiment represents a great increase in Ge mass over IGEX with new segmented Ge detectors and the newest electronic systems for pulse shape discrimination. Their conclusion is that with 500 kg of Ge, enriched to 86 in the isotope 76Ge, the Majorana array operating over 10 years including construction time, can reach a lower limit on T1 2 0 of 4 1027 years. This corresponds to an upper bound of 0.038 0.007eV. One advantage of 76 Ge is that it may well be a candidate for a future more reliable microscopic calculation of the 0 decay nuclear matrix element. 6 Conclusion eutrinoless double beta decay is thus one of the most sensitive approaches with great perspectives to test p N article hysics beyond the Standard Model. The possibilities to use 0 decay for constraining neutrino masses, left ght symmetric models, SUSY and leptoquark scenarios, as well as effective lepton number violating couplings, have been reviewed. It is a very sensitive probe to the lepton number violating terms in the Lagrangian such as the Majorana mass of the light neutrinos, right handed weak couplings involving heavy Majorana neutrinos, as well as Higgs and other interactions involving violation of chirality conservation. p ri 14 In search for neutrinoless double beta decay 76Ge as the source material has multiple advantages. It has high resolution 4 keV at Q with no background from 2 mode. A huge leap in sensitivity is possible applying ultra low background techniques and 0 signal discrimination. There can be a phased approach in the experiment with the increment of target mass. The source and detector are the same material thereby reducing background and maintaining the 4 geometry and the only way to scrutinize 0 DBD claim on short time scale since it tests T1 2 and not m . The consequences of Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay are Total Lepton number violation The most important consequence of the observation of neutrinoless double beta decay is that lepton number is not conserved. This is fundamental for particle physics. Majorana nature of neutrino Another fundamental consequence is that the neutrino is a Majorana

Chunk: Germanium Xperiment IGEX was a search for the neutrinoless double beta decay of 76Ge employing large amounts of In the first phase of the experiment three detectors of 0.7 ents the most sites. It provided a rejection of 60 of the events in the region of IGEX spectrum with and without the PSD background rejection. The IGEX detectors had the initial objective of the detection of the double beta decay of 76Ge. At the end of 1999 certain modifications were made to adapt the detectors to the detection at low energy where the signal of WIMPs Weak Interacting Massive Particles is relevant. The shielding, shared by three IGEX detectors 2 kg germanium detectors isotopically enriched to 86 in 76Ge and the COSME detector, included from inside to outside 40 cm of lead, a PVC box silicone sealed and flushed with nitrogen , 2 mm of cadmium, plastic scintillators working in anticoincidence with the Ge detectors and 20 cm of polyethylene. The shielding was modified on July 2001 as it included only one 2 kg germanium detector inside a more efficient neutron shielding. These techniques of passive very low background and a sharp energy resolution in the Q value region, and effective methods to disentangle signal from noise. A typical example E HPGe detectors, isotopically enriched to 86 in 76Ge. kg active volume each were operated one in the Homestake gold mine 4000 m.w.e. , other in the Baksan Neutrino Observatory 660 m.w.e. and the other in the Canfranc underground laboratory Laboratory 2 at 1380 m.w.e. . A conservative lower bound on the neutrinoless half life of about 1024 years was derived. The International Germanium EXperiment IGEX took data at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory in Spain at a depth of 2450 m.w.e. in a search of neutrinoless double beta decay. Three Germanium detectors RG1, RG2 and RG3 , of 2 kg each, enriched to 86 in 76Ge were used. Efforts were made to reduce part of the radioactive background by discriminating it from the expected signal by comparison of the shape of the pulses PSD of both types of events. The method was applied to the data recorded by two Ge detectors of the IGEX, which has produced one of the two best current sensitivity limits for the Majorana neutrino mass parameter. In the second phase, three large detectors 2 kg each were fabricated with improvements derived from the analysis of data of Phase 1 . They are installed in the Canfranc underground laboratory Laboratory 3 at 2450 m.w.e. inside a low background shielding consisting of 40 cm of lead, a PVC box silicone sealed and flushed with nitrogen , 2mm of cadmium, 20 cm of polyethylene and an active veto plastic scintillators . A pulse shape discrimination PSD technique capable to distinguish single site events decay events for example from multisite ev dominant background events is implemented. New limits on the neutrinoless half life and the neutrino mass parameter were thus obtained from here. In large intrinsic Ge detectors, the charge carriers take 300 500 ns to reach their respective electrodes. These drift times are long enough for the current pulses to be recorded at a sufficient sampling rate. The current pulse contributions from electrons and holes are displacement currents, and therefore dependent on their instantaneous velocities and locations. Accordingly, events occurring at a single site decay events for example have associated current pulse characteristics which reflect the position in the crystal where the event occurred. More importantly, these single site events SSE frequently have pulse shapes that differ significantly from those due to the background events that produce electron hole pairs at several sites by multi Compton scattering process, for example the so called Multi Site Events MSE . Consequently, pulse shape analysis was used to distinguish between these two types of energy depositions since DBD events belong to the SSE class of events and will deposit energy at

Chunk: of the double beta decay 2039.006 keV , as containing several weak photopeaks. It was suggested and has been shown that four of these peaks are produced by a contamination from the isotope 214Bi, whose lines are present throughout the Heidelberg Moscow background spectrum. In this work they performed a measurement of a 226Ra source with a high purity germanium detector. The aim of this work was to study the spectral shape of the lines in the energy region from 2000 to 2100keV and, most important, to show the difference in this spectral shape when changing the position of the source with respect to the detector, and to verify the effect of TCS True Coincidence Summing for the weak 214Bi lines seen in the Heidelberg Moscow experiment. The activity of the 226Ra source is 95.2kBq. The isotope 226Ra appears in the 238U natural decay chain and from its decays also 214Bi is produced. The spectrum of 214Bi is clearly visible in the 226Ra measured spectrum. 214Bi is a naturally occurring isotope it is produced in the 238U natural decay chain through the decay of 214Pb and the alpha decay of 218At. With a subsequent reaction, 214Bi decays then into 214Po the branching ratio with respect to the decay into 210Tl is 99.979 . The decay, however, does not lead d state of 214Po, but to its excited states. From the decays of those excited states to the ground tate the well known spectrum of 214Bi is obtained, which contains more than hundred lines. the table given below, one can see in the energy region around the Q value of the 0 decay 2000 2100keV , ur lines and one E0 transition with energy 2016.7keV are expected. The E0 transition can produce a T double beta decay experiment. The experiment took data during 80 of its installation time. The Q value for neutrinoless double beta decay was recently determined with high precision. The background of the experiment primordial activities of the natural decay chains from 238 232 U, Th, and 40K anthropogenic radio nuclides, like 137 134 125 207 Cs, Cs, Sb, Bi cosmogenic isotopes, produced by activation due to cosmic rays during production and transport the bremsstrahlungs spectrum of 210Bi daughter of 210Pb elastic and inelastic neutron scattering and direct muon induced events.

The considerations for the measurement were the efficiency of the detector which depends on the size of the detector and on the distance source detector and the effect called True Coincidence Summing TCS . The lifetimes of the atomic excited levels are much shorter than the resolving time of the detector. If two gamma rays are emitted successively, they can be registered as a single event with lower energy. This effect is particularly strong at low source-detector distances, and it leads to an underestimation of the intensity of the weak 214Bi lines. This effect is called "True Coincidence Summing TCS". 214Bi is also able to contribute as the source of background in the double beta decay experiment. In the Heidelberg Moscow experiment, the spectral shape of the 214Bi lines has been studied extensively.

In order to perform an effective background measurement of the Heidelberg Moscow double beta decay experiment, a measurement of a 226Ra source with a high-purity germanium detector is carried out. The source activity is 95.2 kBq, and the aim is to study the spectral shape of the lines in the energy region from 2000 to 2210 keV. This is important for understanding the difference in the spectral shape when the position of the source is changed with respect to the detector, as well as for verifying the effect of True Coincidence Summing (TCS) on the weak 214Bi lines observed in

Chunk: measurements show that, if the source is close to the detector, the intensities of the weak Bi lines in the energy region 2000 2100keV are not in the same ratio as reported by Table of Isotopes. The results of the analysis of the data collected by the Heidelberg Moscow experiment with all the five detectors, yielding a first indication for the neutrinoless double beta decay of 76Ge, shows that four 214Bi lines are present in the energy region from 2000 to 2080keV many other strong lines from the same isotope are present in the spectrum , due to the presence of bismuth in the experimental setup, especially in the copper in the vicinity of the Ge crystals. together. If this happens, then a pulse will be recorded which represents the sum of the energies of the two individual photons, instead of two separated pulses with different energies. The TCS effect can result both in lower peak intensity for full energy peaks and in bigger peak intensity for those transitions whose energy can be given by the sum of two lower energy gamma rays. In this case, the lines at 2010.7 keV and 2016.7 keV can be given by the coincidence of the 609.312 keV photon strongest line, .1 with the 1401.50keV photon .27 or with the 1407.98keV photon .15 . The degree of TCS depends on the probability that two gamma rays emitted simultaneously will be detected simultaneously which is a function of the detector geometry and of the solid angle subtended at the detector by the source and for this the intensities of the two lines mentioned above 2010.71keV and 2016.7keV are expected to depend on the position of the source with respect to the detector. The 226Ra ray spectra were measured using a ray spectroscopy system based on an HPGe detector insta the operation room of the HEIDELBERG MOSCOW experiment in Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory, Italy. The coaxial germanium detector had an external diameter of 5.2cm and 4.9cm height. The distance between the top of the detector and the copper cap was kept at 3.5cm. The relative detection efficiency of the detector was 23 and the energy resolution being 3.6keV for the energy range 2000 2100keV 214 s double be The above figure shows the sum spectrum of the 76Ge detectors 1,2,3,4 and 5 over the period August 1990 to May 2003 as recorded by the Heidelberg Moscow experiment. 11 There is no null hypothesis analysis demonstrating that the data require a peak. Furthermore, no simulation has to demonstrate that the analysis correctly finds true peaks or that it would find no peaks if none existed. Monte Carlo simulations of spectra containing different numbers of peaks are needed to confirm the significance of any found peaks. 2. There are three unidentified peaks in the region of analysis that have greater significance than the 2039 keV peak. There is no discussion of the origin of these peaks. 3. There is no discussion of how sensitive the conclusions are to different mathematical models. There is a previous Heidelberg Moscow publication that gives a lower limit of 1.9 1025 y 90 confidence level . This is in conflict with the best value of a newer KDHK paper of 1.5 1025 y. This indicates a dependence of the results on the analysis model and the background evaluation. In this paper they state that a number of other cross checks of the result should also be performed. For example, there is no discussion of how a variation of the size of the chosen analysis window affects the significance of the hypothetical peak. There is no relative peak strength analysis of all the 214Bi peaks. Quantitative evaluations should be made on the four 214Bi peaks in the region of interest. There is no statement of the net count rate of the peaks other than the 2039 keV peak. There being no presentation of the

Chunk: expressed in terms of the translational generators along the Grassman nian directions of the 4, 2 dimensional supermanifold, namely Lim 0 L 1,2 n s n b L n , Lim 0 L 1,2 n s n ab L n . This is a tremendous simplification of the anti BRST invariance of the Lagrangian den sities and in the language of the superfield approach to BRST formalism. In other words, if one is able to show the Grassmannian independence of the super Lagrangian densities of the theory, the anti BRST invariance of the 4D theory follows automatically. In the language of the geometry on the supermanifold, the anti BRST invariance of a 4D Lagrangian density is equivalent to the statement that the translation of the super version of the above Lagrangian density, along the Grassmannian directions of the 4, 2 dimensional supermanifold, is zero. Thus, the super Lagrangian density of an anti BRST invariant 4D theory is a Lorentz scalar, constructed with the help of 4, 2 dimensional superfields obtained after the application of HC , such that, when the partial derivatives w.r.t. the Grassmannian variables and operate on it, the result is zero. The nilpotency and anticommutativity properties that are associated with the con served anti BRST charges and anti BRST symmetry transformations are found to be captured very naturally cf. when we consider the superfield formulation of the anti BRST invariance of the Lagrangian density of a given 1 form gauge theory. We mention, in passing, that one could also derive the analogue of the equations , and for the 4D non Abelian 1 form gauge theory in a straightforward manner. 6 Conclusions In our present investigation, we have concentrated mainly on the anti BRST invariance of the Lagrangian densities of the free 4D non Abelian 1 form gauge theories having no interaction with matter fields within the framework of the superfield approach to BRST formalism. We have been able to provide the geometrical basis for the existence of the anti BRST invariance in the above 4D theories. To be more specific, we have been able to show that the Grassmannian independence of the 4, 2 dimensional super Lagrangian density, expressed in terms of the appropriate superfields, is a clear cut proof that there is an anti BRST invariance cf. , , , , in the 4D theory. If the super Lagrangian density could be expressed as a sum of i a Grassmannian independent term, and ii a derivative w.r.t. the Grassmannian variable, then, the cor responding 4D Lagrangian density will automatically respect BRST and or anti BRST invariance. In the latter piece of the above super Lagrangian density, the derivative could be either w.r.t. or w.r.t. or w.r.t. both of them put together. More specifically, i if the derivative is w.r.t. , the nilpotent symmetry would correspond to the BRST, 15 ii if the derivative is w.r.t. , the nilpotent symmetry would be that of the anti BRST type, and iii if both the derivatives are present together, both the nilpotent anti BRST symmetries would be present together and they would turn out to be anticommuting . For the 4D non Abelian 1 form gauge theories, that are considered on the 4, 2 dimensional supermanifold, it is the HC on the 1 form super connection A that plays a very important role in the derivation of the anti BRST symmetry transformations. The cohomological origin for the above HC lies in the super exterior derivatives d d. This point has been made quite clear in our discussions after the off shell as well as the on shell nilpotent anti BRST symmetry transformations , , , , and . In fact, it is the full kinetic energy term of the above theories owing its origin to the cohomological operator that remains invariant under the above on shell as well the off shell nilpotent anti BRST symmetry transformations.

Chunk: produces specifically the nilpotent anti BRST symmetry transformations for the gauge and anti ghost fields because of the fact that the super 1 form connection A A n cf. and is constructed with a super vector multiplet B , F, F which is the generalization of the gauge field A and the anti ghost fields C C of the ordinary 4D non Abelian 1 form gauge theories to the 4, 2 dimensional supermanifold. As a consequence, only the nilpotent and anticommuting anti BRST symmetry transfor mations for the 4D local fields A , C and C are obtained when the full potential of the HC is exploited within the framework of the above superfield formulation. It is worthwhile to point out that geometrically the super Lagrangian densities, ex pressed in terms of the 4, 2 dimensional superfields, are equivalent to the sum of the kinetic energy term and the translations of some composite superfields obtained after the application of the HC along the Grassmannian directions i.e. and or of the 4, 2 dimensional supermanifold. This observation is distinctly different from our earlier works on the superfield approach to 2D non Abelian 1 form gauge theories which are found to correspond to the topological field theories. In fact, for the latter theories, the total super Lagrangian density turns out to be a total derivative w.r.t. the Grassmannian variables and or . That is to say, even the kinetic energy term of the latter theories, is able to be expressed as the total derivative w.r.t. the variables and or . In our present endeavour, within the framework of the superfield approach to BRST formalism, we have been able to provide i the logical reason behind the non existence of the anti BRST symmetry transformations for the Lagrangian densities and for the 4D non Abelian 1 form gauge theory, ii the explicit explanation for the uniqueness of the equations and for the 4D Abelian 1 form gauge theory, iii the convinc ing proof for the on shell nilpotent anti BRST invariance of the gauge fixing term i.e. s a b A 0, s n a b A 0 for the non Abelian 1 form gauge theories, and iv the compelling arguments for the non existence of the exact analogue s of and for the non Abelian 1 form gauge theory. To the best of our knowledge, the logical explana tions for the above subtle points connected with the 1 form gauge theories are completely 16 new. Thus, the results of our present work are simple, beautiful and original. It is worthwhile to mention that our superfield construction and its ensuing geometrical interpretations are not specific to the Feynman gauge which has been taken into account in our present endeavor . To corroborate this assertion, we take the simple case of the 4D Abelian 1 form gauge theory and write the Lagrangian density in the arbitrary gauge L a, F B A 2 B2 i C C, where is the gauge parameter. It is elementary to check that, in the limit 1, we get back our Lagrangian density for the Abelian theory in the Feynman gauge. The analogue of the equation for the gauge fixing and Faddeev Popov ghost terms in the case of the arbitrary gauge can be expressed as sb h i C A 2 B , sab h i C A 2 B i , sb sab h i 2 A A 2 C C i . The above expression can be easily generalized to the analogues of the equations in terms of the superfields by taking the help of . Thus, the geometrical inter pretations remain intact even in the case of the arbitrary gauge. In a similar fashion, for the 4D non Abelian 1 form gauge theory, the equations , and can be generalized to the case of arbitrary gauge and, subsequently, can be expressed in terms of superfields

Chunk: non existence of any specific nilpotent symmetry transformation could also be explained within the framework of the above superfield approach. We demonstrate 3 the uniqueness of the existence of the nilpotent anti BRST symmetry transformations for the Lagrangian density of a U Abelian 1 form gauge theory. We go a step further and show the existence of the nilpotent BRST symmetry transformations for the specific Lagrangian densities cf. and below of the 4D non Abelian 1 form gauge theory and clarify the non existence of the anti BRST symmetry transformations for these spe cific Lagrangian densities within the framework of the superfield formulation cf. section 5 below . Finally, we provide the geometrical basis for the existence of the off shell nilpo tent and anticommuting anti BRST symmetry transformations and their corresponding generators for the specifically defined Lagrangian densities cf. and or below of the 4D non Abelian 1 form gauge theory in the Feynman gauge. The motivating factors that have propelled us to pursue our present investigation are as follows. First and foremost, to the best of our knowledge, the property of the symmetry invariance of a given Lagrangian density has not yet been captured in the language of the superfield approach to BRST formalism. Second, the above anti BRST invariance of the theory has never been shown, in as simplified fashion, as we demonstrate in our present endeavour. The geometrical interpretations for i the existence of the above nilpotent anti BRST symmetry invariance, and ii the on shell conditions of the on shell nilpotent anti BRST symmetries, turn out to be quite transparent in our present work. Third, we establish the uniqueness of the existence of the anti BRST symmetry invariance in their various forms. The non existence of the specific symmetry transformation is also explained within the framework of the superfield approach to BRST formalism. Finally, our present investigation is the first modest step in the direction to gain some insights into the existence of the nilpotent symmetry transformations and their invariance for the higher form e.g. 2 form, 3 form, etc. gauge theories within the framework of the superfield formulation. The contents of our present paper are organized as follows. In section 2, we recapitulate some of the key points connected with the nilpotent anti BRST symmetry transformations for the free 4D Abelian 1 form gauge theory having no interaction with matter fields in the Lagrangian formulation. The above symmetry transformations as well as the symmetry invariance of the Lagrangian densities are captured in the geometrical superfield approach to BRST formalism in section 3 where the HC on the gauge superfield plays a crucial role. Section 4 deals with the bare essentials of the nilpotent anti BRST symmetry transfor mations for the 4D non Abelian 1 form gauge theory in the Lagrangian formulation. The subject matter of section 5 concerns itself with the superfield formulation of the symmetry invariance of the appropriate Lagrangian densities of the above 4D non Abelian 1 form gauge theory. Finally, in section 6, we summarize our key results, make some concluding remarks and point out a few future directions for further investigations. 2 Anti BRST symmetries in Abelian theory Lagrangian formulation Let us begin with the following anti BRST invariant Lagrangian density of the 4D Abelian 4 1 form gauge theory in the Feynman gauge L a F B A 1 2 B2 i C C, where F A A is the antisymmetric F F curvature tensor that con stitutes the Abelian 2 form ! dx dx F , B is the Nakanishi Lautrup auxiliary multiplier field and C C are the anticommuting i.e. , C C anti ghost fields of the theory.

Chunk: for the anti BRST invariance of the Lagrangian densities in and . In the above forms e.g. from to of the Lagrangian density, the BRST invariance 0 become very transparent and simple because the following equalities and mappings exist, namely sbL a Lim 0 L , sb Lim 0 , s2 , sabL a Lim 0 L , sab Lim 0 , s2 . Similarly, the most beautiful relation , leads to the anti BRST invariance together. Here one has to use the anticommutativity property sbsab i.e. , along the Grassmannian directions of the supermanifold, for its proof. This statement can be mathematically expressed as s a bL a L , sbsab 0. In exactly similar fashion, the on shell nilpotent anti BRST symmetry invariance i.e. s a bL a of the Lagrangian density can also be captured in the language of the superfields if we exploit the expressions to for the Lagrangian density. In the latter case, the on shell nilpotent anti BRST invariance turns out to be like , and with the replacements s a b s a b, L a B L a b , L 1,2,3 B L 1,2,3 b . Mathematically, the anti BRST invariance of the Lagrangian density is captured in the equations to . In the language of geometry on the 4, 2 dimensional supermanifold, the anti BRST invariance corresponds to the Grassmannian independence of the supersymmetric versions of the Lagrangian density . In other words, the trans lation of the super Lagrangian densities i.e. to , along the directions of 9 the supermanifold, is zero. This observation captures the anti BRST invariance of . 4 Anti BRST symmetries in non Abelian theory Lagrangian approach We begin with the following BRST invariant Lagrangian density, in the Feynman gauge, for the four 3 1 dimensional non Abelian 1 form gauge theory see, e.g. L n F B A 1 2B B i C D C, where the curvature tensor F is defined through the 2 form F n dA n iA n A n . Here the non Abelian 1 form gauge connection is A n dx A T and the exterior derivative is . The Nakanishi Lautrup auxiliary field T is required for the linearization of the gauge fixing term and the anti ghost fields C C are essential for the proof of the unitarity in the theory. The latter fields are fermionic i.e. Ca , Ca , CaCb , Ca Cb , etc. in nature. The above Lagrangian density respects the following off shell nilpotent s n b BRST symmetry transformations s n b , namely s n b A D C, s n b C C , s n b , s n b , s n b F i F C . It will be noted that i the curvature tensor F T transforms here under the BRST symmetry transformation. However, it can be checked explicitly that the kinetic energy term 1 4 F F remains invariant under the BRST symmetry transformations, ii the nilpotent anti BRST symmetry transformations corresponding to the above BRST symmetry transformations cannot be defined for the Lagrangian density , and iii the on shell nilpotent version of the above BRST symmetry transformations is also possible if we substitute, in the above symmetry transformations, A . The ensuing on shell i.e. D nilpotent BRST symmetry transformations s n b are s n b A D C, s n b C C , s n b A , s n b F i F C . The above on shell nilpotent transformations leave the following Lagrangian density L n F 1 2 A A i C D C, For the non Abelian 1 form gauge theory, the notations used in the Lie algebraic space are A , A B , D Ca if abcAb Cc Ca i A C a, F A A iA A , A

This representation provides a finite version of the supertableau formulas of and cf. . Fix a positive integer n. For r 1 set u r u1, . . . , ur and use the 9th Variation in with the indeterminates hrs specialized by u n r s 1 if r s n, and 0 otherwise, where hr denotes the r th complete symmetric polynomial. Let us write bs u for the corresponding Schur functions. Then and in give bs u X T Y uT , summed over semistandard tableaux T of shape , such that the entries of the i th row do not exceed n i i. Furthermore, using 1 and 9.6 in we get s x u X s x bs u . Equivalently, this can be interpreted as a combinatorial expression for the polynomials s x u in terms of supertableaux . Identify the indices of u with the symbols 1 , 2 , . . . . A supertableau T is obtained by filling in the diagram of with the indices 1, . . . , n, 1 , 2 , . . . in such a way that in each row resp. column each primed index is to the right resp. below of each unprimed index unprimed indices weakly increase along the rows and strictly increase down the columns primed indices strictly increase along the rows and weakly increase down the columns primed indices in column j do not exceed n j j. Relation implies the following. Proposition 4.1. We have s x u X T Y T unprimed xT Y T primed uT , summed over all supertableaux T. Using , we get an analogous representation for the double Schur polynomials s x a . A reverse supertableau T is obtained by filling in the diagram of with 1This formula in should be corrected by replacing a j n j with a i n i . 17 the indices 1, . . ., n, n , n 1 , . . . including non positive primed indices in such a way that in each row resp. column each primed index is to the right resp. below of each unprimed index unprimed indices weakly decrease along the rows and strictly decrease down the columns primed indices strictly decrease along the rows and weakly decrease down the columns primed indices in column j are not less than j j 1.

Chunk: number of the box added to the diagram i 1 . The sequence r1r2 . . . rl is called the Yamanouchi symbol of R. Introduce the ordering on the set of boxes of a diagram by reading them by columns from left to right and from bottom to top in each column. We call this the column order. We shall write if strictly precedes with respect to the column order. Given a sequence R, construct the set T , R of barred reverse tableaux T with entries from such that T contains boxes 1, . . . , l with 1 l and T i ri, 1 i l. We will distinguish the entries in 1, . . . , l by barring each of them. So, an element of T , R is a pair consisting of a reverse tableau and a chosen sequence of barred entries compatible with R. We shall keep the notation T for such a pair. For example, let R be the sequence 3, 1 3, 2 3, 2, 1 3, 3, 1 4, 3, 1 so that the Yamanouchi symbol is 2 3 2 1. Then for 5, 5, 3 the following barred tableau belongs to T , R 2 4 5 1 3 5 1 2 4 1 2 1 2 . For each box with i i 1, 0 i l, set i . The barred entries r1, . . . , rl divide the tableau into regions marked by the elements of the sequence R, as illustrated r1 r2 rl l . Finally, a reverse tableau T will be called bounded if T 1, j j for all , . . . , 1. Note that bounded tableaux exist only if . We are now in a position to state a rule for the calculation of the Littlewood Richardson polynomials c a defined by . 6 Theorem 2.1. The polynomial c a is zero unless . If then c a X R X T Y T unbarred aT T aT c , summed over all sequences R of the form and all bounded reverse tableaux T T , R . Moreover, for each factor occurring in the formula we have T c . Before proving the theorem, let us point out some properties of the Littlewood Richardson polynomials which are immediate from the rule and consider some exam ples. The polynomial c a is zero unless both diagrams and are contained in and . In this case c a is a homogeneous polynomial in the ai of degree . If 0 then the theorem reproduces a version of the classical Littlewood Richardson rule see Corollary 2.9 below. Note also that by the definition, the polynomials have the symmetry c a c a which is not apparent from the rule. Example 2.2. For the product of the double Schur functions s x a and s 2,1 x a we have s x a s 2,1 x a s 4,1 x a s 3,2 x a s 3,1,1 x a s 2,2,1 x a a 1 a2 a 2 a0 s 3,1 x a a 1 a2 s 2,2 x a a 1 a0 s 2,1,1 x a a 1 a2 a 1 a0 s 2,1 x a . For instance, the coefficient of s 3,1 x a is calculated by the following barred tableaux 1 1 1 1 2 1 compatible with the sequence 2, 1 3, 1 . They contribute respectively a 1 a1, a 2 a0, a1 a2 which sums up to the coefficient a 1 a2 a 2 a0. Alternatively, using the symmetry c a c a we can calculate the coefficient of s 3,1 x a by considering the barred 2, 1 tableaux 1 2 1 1 2 1 compatible with the sequences 3, 1 and 2, 1 3, 1 , respec tively.

Chunk: bounded. Then T c for all with unbarred T . Proof. We argue by contradiction. Taking into account Lemma 2.6, we find that for some i, j with unbarred T we have i, j T i,j j i. Set i, j and consider all barred entries of T assuming for now they exist which are equal to t and occur to the right of the column j. Since T is a reverse tableau, these entries t can only occur in rows 1, 2, . . ., i. Let r, k be the box with the maximum column number k containing t. Then the total number of such entries t does not exceed k j. This implies that the number of boxes t in row t of does not exceed i, j t k . Hence, k t 1. On the other hand, by the boundness of T we have r, k T 1, k k, a contradiction. If none of the boxes to the right of the column j contains t then i, j . However, by the assumption, t T 1,j j, a contradiction. This completes the proof of the theorem. By the column word of a tableau T we will mean the sequence of all entries of T written in the column order. Corollary 2.9. Suppose that . The Littlewood Richardson coefficient c equals the number of bounded reverse tableaux T whose column word coincides with the Yamanouchi symbol of a certain sequence R of the form . This can be shown to be equivalent to a well known version of the Littlewood Richardson rule. Corollary 2.9 also holds with the boundness condition dropped see Lemma 2.7. By the corollary, c counts the cardinality of the intersection of two finite sets the set of column words of bounded reverse tableaux and the set of Yamanouchi symbols of the sequences of the form . Remark 2.10. Due to , the multiplication rule for the polynomials s x u is obtained from Theorem 2.1 by replacing ai with un i 1 for each i. The corresponding coefficients are polynomials in the ui uj, , with positive integer coefficients. 13 Corollary 2.11. Suppose that the polynomials c a are defined by the expansion with x1, . . ., xn . Then c a is independent of n as soon as n 1. Moreover, if 1 then c a 0. Proof. This follows from the boundness condition on the reverse tableaux. 3 Applications 3.1 Equivariant Schubert calculus on the Grassmannian As in the Introduction, consider the equivariant cohomology ring H T Gr n, N as a module over Z t1, . . . , tN . Let x1, . . . , xn denote the Chern roots of the dual S of the tautological subbundle S of the trivial bundle CN Gr n,N so that for the total equivariant Chern class of S we have cT S n Y 1 xi . Then, due to 6, Lecture 8, Proposition 1.1 see also , the equivariant Schubert classes can be expressed by s x u , tN, . . . , t1, 0, . . . . Hence, Theorem 2.1 yields a multiplication rule for the equivariant Schubert classes. The corresponding stability property is implied by Corollary 2.11. Corollary 3.1. We have X d , where d X R X T Y T unbarred tm T c tm T T , summed over all sequences R of the form and all bounded reverse tableaux T T , R . In particular, the d are polynomials in the ti tj, , with positive integer coefficients. Moreover, the coefficients d , regarded as polynomials in the variables ai defined in , are independent of n and m, as soon as the inequalities n 1 1 and m 1 1 hold. 14 Example 3.2. For any n 3 and m 4 we have 2,1 4,1 3,2

The first manifestly positive rule for the expansion of was given by Knutson and Tao by using combinatorics of puzzles. Although the stability property was not pointed out in , it can be deduced directly from the puzzle rule or by applying the weight preserving bijection between the puzzles and the barred tableaux constructed by Kreiman . 3.2 Quantum immanants and higher Capelli operators Let gln denote the general linear Lie algebra over C. Consider the center Z gln of the universal enveloping algebra U gln . The algebra U gln is equipped with the natural filtration. For all n we identify gln 1 as a subalgebra of gln in a usual way and denote by gl the corresponding inductive limit n gln. Due to Olshanski , there exist filtration preserving homomorphisms on Z gln Z gln 1 , n 1, which allow one to define the algebra Z of the virtual Casimir elements for the Lie algebra gl as the inverse limit Z gln , n , in the category of filtered algebras. The quantum immanants S n are elements of the center Z gln of the universal enveloping algebra U gln parameterized by the diagrams with at most n rows see . The elements S n form a basis of Z gln and they are consistent with the Olshanski homomorphisms so that on S n 7 S n 1, where we assume S exceeds n. For any diagram , the corresponding virtual quantum immanant S is then defined as the sequence S S n n 0 . 15 The elements S parameterized by all diagrams form a basis of the algebra Z so that we can define the coefficients f by the expansion S S X f S . Note that the same coefficients f determine the multiplication rule for the higher Capelli operators , which are defined as the sequences of the images of the quantum immanants S n, where each image is taken under a natural representation of gln by differential operators see . Corollary 3.3. The coefficient f is zero unless . If then f X R X T Y T unbarred T c , summed over all sequences R of the form and all bounded reverse tableaux T T , R . In particular, the f are nonnegative integers. Proof. Due to the stability property of the quantum immanants, it suffices to calculate the corresponding coefficients for the expansion of the products S n S n. The images of the quantum immanants S n under the Harish Chandra isomorphism can be identified with the double Schur polynomials s x a where the sequence a is specialized to see . Therefore, the coefficients in question coincide with the corresponding specializations of the Littlewood Richardson polynomials c a . Example 3.4. Using Example 2.2 we get S S 2,1 S 4,1 S 3,2 S 3,1,1 S 2,2,1 5 S 3,1 3 S 2,2 S 2,1,1 3 S 2,1 . In the course of the proof of Corollary 3.3 we also calculated the coefficients for the expansion of the products S n S n for any n. Some other formulas for these coefficients were obtained in . In particular, it was shown that the f are integers, although their positivity property was not established there. Note also that the algebra of virtual Casimir elements Z is isomorphic to the algebra of shifted symmetric functions see . The latter can be regarded as the specialization of or rather, its extension over C at . 16 4 Supertableau formulas for s x a and c a Here we obtain one more rule for the calculation of the Littlewood Richardson poly nomials c a .

This answer has been generated based on the academic chunk provided. A thorough review of the text has allowed me to extract three key concepts, all of which are then transformed into search queries. Each query seeks to interrogate different elements of the text. The first is fairly general, focusing on understanding what epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are and their common applications. The second delves into the notion of size and spatial order within the formation of quantum dots, which the text suggests is a key subject. Finally, the third explores the topic of linear analysis applied to quantum dot ordering, with a particular focus on correlation lengths, which are mentioned to characterize quantum dot spatial order. Please note that, depending on the search engine used, these queries might need to be altered to ensure optimal results in your specific case.

If you'd like to find more related sources, these queries should provide solid leads. They are designed to cover the main topics found in the academic chunk, thus providing a comprehensive overview of the topic at hand

Chunk: in this discussion. Further calculations will proceed assuming that the surface energy density, , nor the wetting potential, W H , depend on H or similarly that Fsw H, H has a purely isotropic dependence on H. This assumption can be made without affecting any of the qualitative results. 2.2.1.3 total diffusion potential Having dispensed with the discussion of the various sources of anisotropy, the total diffusion potential is stated for the case of 4 fold symmetric elastic anisotropy and a completely isotropic surface energy and wetting potential. k, H with f k, H E0 1 A sin2 2 k k k2 W H case a Eq. h E0 1 A sin2 2 k k F sw k2 F sw i case b Eq. a 1 A sin2 2 k bk2 c case c general . 12 Table 3 Characteristic wave numbers, characteristic times and associated dimensionless variables for the three cases addressed in Eq. kc tc case a E0 3 D E4 0 k kc W H E2 0 case b E0 F sw F sw 3 D E4 0 k kc F sw F sw E2 0 case c a b b3 D a4 k kc cb a2 2.2.2 Dynamics The dynamics is governed by surface diffusion, just as for the fully isotropic case. It is assumed that the diffusivity is isotropic as was done for the surface energy and the wetting energies thus, all anisotropy in the film evolution dynamics comes from elastic effects alone. The possibility and effects of an anisotropic diffusion potential is discussed in Appendix D also see . The time dependence of the surface perturbations simply follows Eqs. and , but with Eq. used for f k, H . As for the isotropic case, appropriate characteristic wave numbers kc and time scales tc can be found for each of the three cases along with the associated dimensionless wave vector and dimensionless wetting parameter . These are listed in Table 3. The dispersion relation, k can be expressed in terms of these dimensionless variables and , giving kc t 1 c 2 1 A sin2 2 k 2 .

The autocorrelation function is denoted CA x where x is the difference vector between two points in the x plane. The spectrum function is a function of k, and it is denoted CA k .

The au tocorrelation function is the result of a spatial average over one experiment or one simulation numerical experiment . It is regular and repeatable because it is closely tied to the correlation function and spectrum function that results from an ensemble average Eqs. X and X . These are denoted as C x and the spectrum Ck respectively. Note that the ensemble averaged functions do not have a superscript A. These ensemble average correlation functions are useful in the analysis of stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations. . From a strictly technical viewpoint, the spatial average and the ensemble average are not exactly the same however, they are closely enough connected that it is reasonable to use one as a substitute for the other Sec. 3.1 and Appendix 3 . In the following, the analysis of SAQD order via autocorrelation and correlation functions is discussed Sec. 3.1 . Then, the stochastic initial conditions are discussed Sec. 3.2 . Then, the prediction of the Fourier transforms of the correlation functions is discussed Sec. 3.3 . The real space correlation functions are presented Sec. 3.4 . Finally, there are some notes regarding generalizing the analysis method to any dispersion relation that has peaks Sec. 3.5 , for example, peaks related to broken four fold symmetry or growth on a miscut substrate. 3.1 Correlation Functions and SAQD order Auto correlation functions are well suited for investigating SAQD order. The autocorrelation function is defined as CA x 1 A Z d2x h x x h x . Its Fourier transform sometimes called the spectrum , spectrum function or power spectrum is CA 2 d Z d2 x e ik xC x 2 d A hk 2 , where A is the projected area of the film in the x y plane. A periodic array of SAQDs leads to a periodic auto correlation function. A nearly periodic array leads to a range limited periodic auto correlation function. The ensemble mean of these autocorrelation functions can be calculated, and it is a good predictor of a SAQD order. 3.1.1 Periodic array Consider a perfectly periodic height fluctuation corresponding to a perfect lattice of SAQDs, h x h0 N N X ikn x xO plus higher order harmonic, where the dots have a height proportional to h0, N is the degree of symmetry, probably, 4 fold or 6 fold, xO is a random origin offset. cos 2 n 1 N i sin 2 n 1 N j , In a linear analysis, the higher order harmonics do not come into play, so they are neglected here.

Chunk: approximations in the non linear case. Unlike the autocorrelation function, the spectrum function fluctuates greatly about its mean. In fact, the fluctuations are about 100 Appendix E.2 . These large fluctuations result in the commonly observed speckle pattern for the spectrum function CA k Figs. 6.a and c . Contrast this pattern with ensemble mean spectrum function Ck shown in Figs. 6.b and d. These speckles can be removed by a smoothing operation, and a relation similar to Eq. results Appendix E.2.2 . Finally, it should be noted that just as CA k is the Fourier transform of CA x , Ck is the Fourier transform of C x Appendix E.1 . 3.2 Stochastic Initial Conditions To model or simulate the formation of SAQDs, it is absolutely essential to include some sort of stochastic effect. An initially flat film h x, 0 0 is in unstable equilibrium. Thus, to seed the formation of quantum dots, it is necessary to perturb the flat surface. The simplest method to do this is to use stochastic initial conditions with deterministic evolution. One can tenuously suppose that white noise initial conditions do not bias the ultimate evolution of the film. Thus, the initial conditions are taken from an ensemble with zero mean, 0. and a spatial correlation function, C x, x , 0 2 d x x , where the brackets indicate an ensemble average, is the noise amplitude, and d x is the d dimensional Dirac Delta function. White noise conditions have an infinite amplitude which is not physical. Thus, a minimum modification can be made to cut off the infinite fluctuations. C x, x , 0 2 2 b2 0 d 2 exp x x 2 2b2 0 ! In the limit b0 0, this correlation function reverts to the white noise correlation functions. In reciprocal space, Ckk hk h k 2 2d Z ddx Z ddx e ik x ik x C x, x , 0 2 2 d e 1 2 b2 0k2 d k k Letting b0 0, the white noise reciprocal space correlation function is obtained. Thus, the initial spectrum function is 2 d e 1 2 b2 0k2. The atomic scale has a small and short lived influence on the final film morphology Appendix F , but the cutoff procedure is useful for choosing a reasonable value of 2. It seems reasonable to choose 2 so that the initial r.m.s. fluctuation p C 0, 0 1 2is one monolayer 1 ML . Also, choosing 2 d 2 1 ML 2 d, where the natural unit 1 ML is, of course, material dependent. Using stochastic initial conditions, one can integrate individual initial conditions to obtain representative samples and then average over many realizations, the Monte Carlo approach, or one can calculate analytically, the statistical measures of the ensemble. The ensemble statistical measures are strongly related to the statistical measures of order for an individual realization, so the second approach is opted for here. Thus, the predicted SAQD order is ultimately stated in terms of ensemble correlation functions. 18 3.3 Reciprocal Space Correlation Functions The reciprocal space correlation function, Ckk , and spectrum function, Ck, are calculated for the 1D and 2D isotropic case and then for the 2D anisotropic case. Generally Ck includes the length scales introduced in Sec. 2.1.3 as well as the atomic scale cutoff b0. Ckk hk t h k t e k k 2 2 e k k t 1 2 b2 0k2 2 k k . Without much error, b0 can be neglected in the exponential Appendix F . Using Eq. , the spectrum function is then identified as 2 d e2 kt. Ck is now calculated for each model 1D isotropic, 2D isotropic and 2D anisotropic. 3.3.1 one dimensional The one dimensional surface is the simplest, so it is treated first. The spectrum function is simply e2 0t 1 2 2 2t

At t2, .4 nm, and 4.14, and correlation is expected to extend about 4 dots. However, it should be noted that this correlation is not lattice like. Corresponding numerical results and ensemble correlation functions are shown in Figs. 6 and 5.a c. 4.2 General case of In it was suggested that allowing the film to evolve with close to the stability threshold could enhance the SAQD correlation. It is interesting to note what happens for different values of . Similar analytic and numerical calculations are performed for the large film height limit, 0, for the 2D anisotropic Ge Si surface. For 0, .3tc, .0 nm, and 1.84, so one to two dots in a row are expected to be well correlated. h x and real space correlation functions are shown in Figs. 5g i. The range of order is significantly less than for the case 0.208 Sec. 4.1 . For Si Ge at 600K, the 2D anisotropic predictions for tlarge and L are shown in Fig. 8. In general, the closer is to the critical value 0.25, the longer the correlation length. One can manipulate equation to find that tlarge tc varies approximately but not exactly as 1 4 1 ln h2 large A 2k2 c . Consequently, L 1 4 1 2. Furthermore, the appearance of hlarge and 2 inside the logarithm shows that the final order estimates are not overly sensitive to the guesses for 2 and h2 large. The divergence of L with 1 4 is initially encouraging, but it is clear that for the parameters used for Ge Si, subatomic control of the film height is needed to yield significantly enhanced long range correlations. Also as one approaches this threshold, one can probably expect thermal activation to nucleate subcritical SAQDs whose effect on supercritically formed SAQDs is uncertain. There should be some interesting phenomena at the the H Hc. 24 l a r g e c l a r g e k 0 L 0 l a r g e Figure 8 tlarge and L vs. for Si Ge using the 2D anisotropic model as described in Sec. 4. Units are normalize to characteristic time tc and predicted number of correlated dots . 5 Discussion Conclusions The order of epitaxial self assembled quantum dots during initial stages of growth has been studied using a common model of surface diffusion with stochastic initial conditions. It has been shown that correlation functions of small surface height fluctuations can be predicted analytically using corresponding ensemble average correlation functions. These correlation functions are characterized by correlation lengths that can be predicted by analytic formulas given certain reasonable assumptions about the diffusion potential and the height and lateral scale of initial atomic scale random fluctuations. Thus, the linear model of film surface height evolution via surface diffusion has enabled analytic predictions of epitaxial SAQD order that are valid for small film height fluctuations. To what extent the initial degree of order persists into later stages of growth remains to be studied, but the order of initial stages should certainly have a strong influence on final outcomes. Furthermore, the linear analysis should provide insight into the less tractable non linear behavior. These predictions of SAQD order have been used to investigate the role of crystal anisotropy and initial film height. Crystal anisotropy has been shown to play an important role in enhancing SAQD order as observed in previous numerical simulations continuum and atomistic numerical simulations. If a four fold symmetry is assumed for the governing dynamics, the effect of crystal anisotropy to linear order is felt through elastic anisotropy alone. It is shown that elastic anisotropy

Chunk: can admit only a limited anisotropy. They both contain rank 2 symmetric tensors, and W in the x plane. For a two dimensional surface, this means that they can either have two fold symmetric rotations by 180 anisotropy or none at all. Thus, for the case considered in Sec. 2.2.1.2, four fold symmetric anisotropy , the surface and wetting parts of the diffusion potential must be completely isotropic. As discussed in Sec. 2.2.1.2, the surface of zinc blend structures, such as the mentioned Ge, Si, InAs and GaAs present a rather complicated situation. For simplicity, it is assumed here that the surface and wetting energies are at least four fold symmetric. Consequently, they are completely isotropic. Finally, it should be noted that if Fsw depends on higher order derivatives, then the discussion is greatly compli cated and a larger class of anisotropic terms is admissible. For example, when Fsw Fsw H, H, H, H, . . . is expanded about H x H to quadratic order in h, it would contains tensors of rank 6 and maybe even higher. B.2 Linearizing the general model The elastic part of the linearized diffusion potential was discussed in Sec. 2.2.1.1 and Appendix C . Eq. can be found by using all of the following steps with the substitution Fsw W. The surface wetting part of the diffusion po tential x is found by expanding Fsw to second order in the film height fluctuation, h, and then taking the variational derivative. Expanding Fsw about 0, Fsw H h, h F sw F sw h F sw h hF sw h . . . 1 2F sw h2 1 2 F sw h h O h3 . Note that in this expansion, all the F mn sw terms are constant with respect to h and depend implicitly on the average film height, H. The first index indicates the mth derivative with respect to h. The second index indicates the nth derivative with respect to h. The derivatives are evaluated for a perfectly flat surface of height H. Thus, F mn H, H H, . Since h is a vector in the x plane, F mn sw is a tensor of rank n. Taking the variational derivative of H, H and keeping terms to order h1, F h x F sw F sw F sw h F sw h . Note that the F sw term vanishes because it is constant, and the F sw term vanishes upon simplification. Additionally, the F sw can be neglected if one enforces the condition that the film height fluctuations do not add or subtract material from the surface, namely that R ddx h x, t 0. Alternatively, one can discard it in anticipation of taking the gradient of the diffusion potential, since it is a constant. The term F , or because F sw is a constant. Multiplying through by the atomic volume, lin x h F sw h F sw h i . 28 B.2.1 isotropic case In the isotropic case, F sw must be proportional to the identity so that F I thus, sw,lin x h F sw h x F sw 2h x i . Taking the inverse Fourier transform of this equation, sw,lin, h F sw F sw k2i hk. This gives case b in Eq. . B.2.2 anisotropic case If the surface is anisotropic, then F sw in Eq. is a rank 2 symmetric tensor in the x plane. Thus, it can have two distinct eigenvalues, and automatically has 2 fold rotational symmetry rotations by 180 . If any other symmetry is assumed such as 4 fold symmetry rotations by 90 , then F sw must be fully isotropic. Taking the inverse Fourier transform, sw,lin, h F sw k F sw k i hk.

Chunk: of the diffusion potential that is completely isotropic. C Elastic Anisotropy In principal, the anisotropic elastic energy k is found in the same fashion as the isotropic elastic energy. The flat film, initially in a state of biaxial stress, is perturbed by a small periodic surface fluctuation of amplitude h0. An appropriate elastic field is added to satisfy the perturbed traction free boundary condition at the free surface. Finally, the elastic energy is evaluated at the free surface to first order in h0. The coefficient h0 is the sought after k. The equations themselves are cumbersome and best solved using a numeric implementation, so an abstract procedure for calculating k is outlined here. k is found for k. Let the surface have a height variation h x h0eikx. To first order in h0, the surface normal is n x ikh0eikxi k. The elastic energy needs to be calculated to first order in h0. To find the elastic energy, it is necessary to find the perturbing elastic field to first order in h0. The initial unperturbed stress state is m 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 , where m. Note that this stress state is isotropic in the x y plane and thus independent of rotations about the vertical axis. Under this stress state, a flat surface is traction free. With the height perturbation, the traction is n m m j1eikx. Next to find the perturbing elastic fields. These are not isotropic in the x y plane, and it is necessary to take into account the angle. First, the 3 3 3 3 elastic stiffness tensor cijkl is constructed for the cube orientation from the compact 9 9 matrix cij. The tensor representation aids in rotation. The stiffness tensor is then passively rotated in the x y plane by an angel k, cijkl k 3 X m,n,p, k imR k jnR k kpR k lqcmnpq 29 where R k cos k sin k 0 sin k cos k 0 0 0 1 . This passive rotation of cijkl is equivalent to actively rotating the wave vector k. The appropriate form for the perturbing displacement field is found. Assume a displacement of the form ui x, y, z Uiek ix z , where can have a complex value. The elastic equilibrium equations are 3 X i,k, k xk . . . 3. 3 X k, Ul ! k2ek ix z 0 where Cjl k, 3 X i, k i i1 i3 i k1 k3 . Factoring out k2ek ix z , the part in parenthesis must be identically zero. To obtain a non trivial solution, the determinant of Cjl k, to zero. Six complex values of are found.

For the variance to be vanishing, the integral in Eq. must be bounded finite . If time, , the exponential in Eq. guarantees that the integral is bounded. For time , the integral is only bounded if the atomic scale cutoff . 34 F Atomic Scale Cutoff Starting from Eq. , 2 d e2 kt 1 2 b2 0k2. The effect of the small scale cutoff is both small and short lived, as it only works to suppress fluctuations with large wavenumbers. The most important fluctuations have wavenumbers between 0 and 2kc. Thus, the typical size of the cutoff term is about b2 0k2 c. If a typical dot size or spacing size 10 nm, and a typical atomic scale is 10 1 nm, a typical value for this term is about 10 3 10 2. To calculate the effect of the cutoff, it can absorbed into the time dependent part with the substitution b b 1 b2 0 4bDt so that its effect lasts only as long as a perturbation with atomic scale curvature b0 . Thus, Eq. is a good approximation. Acknowledgement Thanks to L. Fang and C. Kumar for useful comments during the writing of this article.

Chunk: important influence on the final outcome. At later stages when surface fluctuations are large, there is a natural tendency of SAQDS to either order or ripen Ordering systems tend to evolve slowly due to critical slowing down , while ripening tends to diminish order further. Thus, it is possible that the linear model could, in fact, yield good predictions of SAQD order. The simplification and linearizion facilitates the development of analytic solutions that are most transparent, easily portable to multiple material systems and have no effective limit on system size. Finally, it is virtually impossible to have a thorough understanding of the full non linear model without first having a thorough understanding of the linear behavior. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the physical assumptions and mathematical 1It is likely that there a transition from stable, to metastable and finally to unstable. The analysis presented in would appear to support such a view where the film height acts as the control parameter driving the transition. There is also some controversy regarding whether all dot growth is nucleationless or not. 2Compare various figures in . 2 approximations used to model film growth. Section 3 discusses the stochastic initial conditions and the resulting correlation functions and correlation lengths. Section 4, presents a procedure for estimating SAQD order with an application to Ge dots on a Si substrate. Section 5 presents conclusions, while Appendices A F present additional calculational details. 2 Modeling The formation of SAQDs is modeled as a deterministic surface diffusion process with stochastic initial conditions. The resulting equations and ultimately the sought after correlation functions are different depending on whether the film surface is treated as one dimensional isotropic, two dimensional isotropic or two dimensional anisotropic. The 1D and 2D isotropic cases are discussed first, and then the essential differences of the 2D anisotropic model are presented. The stochastic initial conditions need to be expressed in terms of the correlation functions that are also use to analyze order consequently, the discussion of the initial conditions is deferred to Sec. 3.2. It should be noted that the results presented here are fairly general. There has been a good deal of recent work refining the modeling of nucleationless growth processes to incorporate various phenomenological aspects of SAQD growth. For example, the inclusion of orientation dependent surface energy , strain dependent surface energy and explicit modeling of atomic species segregation and film substrate inter diffusion. Two models are presented here. One is a simple concrete example. It is the simplest model one can use including elastic effects surface energy and wetting energy. The second model is more abstract and describes the general case of a local potential energy that depends on both the film height and film height gradient. One effect that is not examined here is that of mixed 4 fold and two fold symmetry. Such a mixing can occur due to diffusional anisotropy or surface energy anisotropy. Sec. 2.2.1.2 and Appendix D . However, a similar analysis procedure should work for these cases as well. The general procedure for possible application to other models is discussed in Sec. 3.5. The following discussion will use abstract vector notation, e.g. k instead of ki, etc. Also, because it is sometimes computational expedient to perform one dimensional modeling , the case of a one dimensional surface with two dimensional volume is discussed along with the case of an isotropic 2D surface. To facilitate this combined discussion, the dimensionality of the surface will be denoted as d. In Secs. 3.3 and 3.4, , 2 will be substituted as appropriate. Finally, much of the calculation involves reciprocal space. The convention used for the Fourier transforms is f x Z ddk eik xfk, and 2 d Z ddx e ik xf x following the example of . 2.1 1D and 2D Isotropic model This discussion pertains to both the 1D model

Chunk: of strain dependent surface energies. The second form can not represent such an effect because the derivation assumes that the surface energy only depends on local quantities, H and H whereas the strain effect is non local. However, it is reasonable to conjecture that a more detailed analysis of the effects of a strain dependent surface energy term would produce a coefficient function f k, H not very different from the case c general form of Eq. . Thus, the following analysis may very well apply to this more exotic model, but more study is needed to be certain. 2.1.2 Dynamics As discussed in Sec. 2.1.1, the dynamics are derived assuming no flux of new material and keeping only terms to linear order in the height fluctuation, h x, t . Under these assumptions, Eq. can be decomposed into a 5 Table 1 Characteristic wave numbers, characteristic times and associated dimensionless variables for the three cases addressed in Eq. . kc tc case a 2M 1 2 m 3 16D M 4 1 4 8m k kc W H 4M 2 1 2 4m case b 2M 1 2 m F sw F sw 3 16D M 4 1 4 8m k kc F sw F sw 4M 2 1 2 4m case c a b b3 D a4 k kc cb a2 trivial equation for H and an equation for the film height fluctuation by inserting Eq. . d H x D lin x where lin x is the inverse Fourier transform of Eqs. and , and it depends implicitly on the average film height H. Note that the time dependence is implicitly while the coordinate dependence is explicit. The explicit coordinate dependence serves to distinguish Assuming that the diffusivity D is constant, the Fourier transform of Eq. gives the linearized differential equation for the evolution of each Fourier component. k, H hk. Solving Eq. , hk t hk e kt k, H . The surface evolves in reciprocal space as an initial condition, hk multiplied by an envelope function, e kt. For most values of H, this envelope function has a peak. As time passes, this peak narrows and can be approximated by a gaussian. To analyze this behavior, appropriate dimensionless variables are defined. Then, the stability of the film is discussed. Finally, k is expanded about its peak to aid analytic calculations. The time dependent behavior of the film height fluctuations is facilitated by using a characteristic wave number, characteristic time and related dimensionless variables. For the general case c of Eq. , the characteristic wavenum ber is , and the characteristic time is D bk4 c b3 D a4 . These characteristic dimensions can be used to define a dimensionless wave vector, k kc and a dimensionless wetting parameter c bk2 c cb a2. One can also define a dimensionless time, t tc. To obtain the corresponding characteristic scales for cases a and b, one merely has to plug in the appropriate substitutes for a, b and c and follow the pattern. For example, for case a, make the substitution a 2M 2 2 m, etc. Table 1 summarizes these values for all three cases. For all three cases, f k, H and the growth constant k reduce to the following forms f k, H f kc , H bk2 c 2 kc t 1 c 2 2 , where k kc is the dimensionless wave number. These forms are plotted in Figs. 1a and 2. Fig. 1a shows f k, H bk2 c vs. for an isotropic or one dimensional surface. Figs. 2 shows tc k vs. for a 2D anisotropic surface Sec. 2.2 . However, the curves marked 0 are identical to the dispersion relation for a 1D or 2D isotropic surface compare Eqs. and . 2.1.3 Peaks The peak growth rate and the corresponding wavenumber k can be found from Eq. . k

Petojevi c verified useful properties of the Ki z functions which generalize Kurepa s left factorial function. In this note, we present simplified proofs of two of these results and we answer the open question stated in . Finally, we discuss the differential transcendency of the Ki z functions. A. Petojevi c 7, p. 3. considered the family of functions vMm s a, z v X 1 k 1 z m 1 k m 1 L s 2F1 a, k z, m 2 1 t , for R z v m 2, where v N is a positive integer m is an integer s, a, z are complex variables L s F t is Laplace transform and 2F1 a, b, c x is the hypergeometric function x 1 . D . Kurepa has considered in the articles 1, p. 151. and 2, p. 297. a complex function defined by the integral K z Z 0 e t tz 1 t 1 dt, for R z 0. Especially, for Kurepa s function K z , it is true that K z 1M0 1 1, z , for R z 0, according to . For various of values of parameters v, m, s, a, z from , different special functions, as presented in , are obtained. A. Petojevi c has con sidered in the article 10, p. 1640. the following sequence of functions Ki z 1M0 1 1, z i 1 1M0 1 1, i 1 1M 1 1 1, i , for i N and R z i. On the basis of the definition in , the following represen tation via Kurepa s function is true Ki z 1 i 1 ! K z i 1 K i 1 , for i N and R z i 1. Note that 2, p. 297. and therefore K1 z K z for R z 0. Analytical and differential algebraic properties of Kurepa s function K z are considered in articles 1 12 and in many other articles. On the basis of well known statements for Kurepa s function K z , using representation , in many cases we can get simple proofs for analogous statements for Ki z functions. For example, it is a well known fact that it is possible to analytically continue Ku repa s function to a meromorphic function with simple poles at integer points m, m 3 2, p. 303. , 3, p. 474. . Residues of Kurepa s function at these poles have the following form Research partially supported by the MNTRS, Serbia, Grant No. 144020. 1 2 Branko J.

Therefore, the affirmative answer for Question 3.7. from is true for complex values z C . A note about the , at the end of this note let us emphasize one differential algebraic fact for the sequence of functions Ki z . On the basis of the formula from the article , we can conclude that each Ki z function satisfies the following recurrence re lation i 1 ! Ki z 1 i 1 ! Ki z z i . The previous relation can be used to verify the differential transcendency of these functions as discussed in . Therefore, we can conclude that each Ki z function is a differential transcendental function, i.e. it satisfies no algebraic differential equation over the field of complex ra tional functions.

Chunk: de pending on the context just as dimension and codimension are useful for discussing manifolds , so we will not stick to just one of these terms. We will let C k denote the sheaf of degree k currents with the index written above as is typical for cohomology since d increases the degree. We will similarly write Ck for the sheaf of dimension k currents with the index written below since d decreases dimension as is common for homology. We use the following convention to realize a form as a current so that if is C1 then d is the same whether computed as a current or a form. Definition 25. Given an k form with L1 coefficients on an n manifold X we realize as a degree k current via 7 1 k 1 2 Z X Definition 26. Given a possibly complex nonzero deRham cohomology class c Hk deRham X with f c c for some scalar C we will refer to a current C in the same cohomology class as as an eigencurrent for f if f C C. Currents naturally pushforward, rather than pullback. Because we are considering maps which are not necessarily invertible we need to address how this pullback is performed. If f has critical points it is impossible to define a continuous pullback operation f on all currents in a way that agrees with expected cases. For instance, consider f x x2 and let Ca be the dimension one current on R with Ca h x dx h a , i.e. Ca is a unit mass vector. Then the pullback f Ca should be the sum of weighted unit masses at the two preimages of this vector just like the pullback of a point mass 18 is a sum of point masses each weighted by multiplicity , that is, f Ca 1 2 a C a C a . However, these pullbacks do not converge to a current as a 0 so f C0 is not defined. Since we want f to be continuous, we are forced to work with currents that have some extremely mild regularity. We address this in the next section. 5.1 Nimble Forms and Lenient Currents Finding a good set of currents to use to study smooth finite self maps not necessarily invertible of compact manifolds turns out to be rather delicate. Our solution is to first expand our class of forms to include pushforwards in the sense of currents of forms through an appropriate class of smooth maps. Then we restrict our attention to currents which act on this extended class of forms. This solution has the very nice property that it can potentially be adapted directly to study the dynamics of other various other categories of smooth maps by simply changing which forms are considered nimble, according to the class of maps used . It will convenient to first define the natural pushforward operator on forms Definition 27. Given a compact orientable manifold X we let SX be the category of smooth maps f X X of nonzero degree and having the property that the critical set has measure zero. We use critical set here to mean the points at which Df is not invertible. It follows from our definition that the image of any set of positive measure under some f SX has positive measure. Definition 28. Given a compact orientable manifold X we define N k to be those currents which are a finite sum of currents of the form p where p X X is a map in SX and is a form of degree k. The pushforward p is computed in the sense of currents. We will later show that nimble forms are also, in fact, bona fide forms. Definition 29. We topologize N k by saying j in N k if for sufficiently large j there are maps f1, . .

Chunk: H older of any exponent log m log m M . Proof. The proof is elementary. 5.3 Eigencurrents for Cohomologically Expanding Smooth Maps We will call a section V of Vk TX a k vector field. We define V L loc to be the L loc norm of the function x 7 Vx . Whether Theorem 12 applies to a map will depend the size of Vk Df . Replacing f with an iterate does not affect the needed estimate so we make the following definition. Definition 40. We define k to be the limit supremum as j of Vk D f j 1 j . It follows that 1 e for any Lyapunov exponent and that k k 1 Fed69 page 33 . We let B be the sheaf F k 1 L loc . The norm clearly makes B into a Banach space. Given a member B B , since the operator norm on each Vk TxX is equal to the norm already defined on Vk T xX for each x X then B is equal to supremum of the L loc norm of the function x 7 B Vx as V varies over all L loc k vector fields of norm no more than one. Theorem 41. Given f X X an a map in SX for the compact orientable manifold X, assume that c Hk deRham X is a cohomology class using ei ther real or complex deRham cohomology which is an eigenvector for f with eigenvalue . Assume also that k 1. Then there exists a unique eigen current C with local F k 1 L loc potentials representing the class c. Moreover C has local F k 1 H potentials. Also, given any neighborhood U X of any point in the support of C, then for every lenient current C with local F k 1 L loc potentials and which represents the cohomology class c then f k U Supp C for all large k. Assume that the linear map f Hk deRham X Hk deRham X is dominated by a single simple real eigenvalue r. Given C any current which has local F k 1 L loc potentials and which represents a cohomology class in the k 1 chronically expanding subspace of Hk deRham X , then the successive rescaled 25 pullbacks f k C rk of C converge to a multiple of C in the sense of lenient currents and thus also in the sense of currents . Proof. We let L loc , A and C be the kernel and image respec tively of B d L k. By Theorem 24, H1 X, A can be canonically identified with Hk X, K . Since B is acyclic then every member of H1 X, A is a closed bundle with respect to the short exact sequence A B C . From Lemma 33 there is an induced f cohomorphism of the short ex act sequence A B d C . Also C is a space of lenient currents by Lemma 33 and thus has a natural structure as a topological vector space. If a sequence Bi B converges to B B , R X Bi d R X B d dB, so the map d B C is continuous. The cohomomorphism fB is pullback f of differential forms. Fixing any real satisfying k it is clear from the definition of k 1 that one can choose a real f l d lfor all l N. The lth pullback f l B of B B satisfies f l B supV B Vk D f l V where the supremum is taken over all k covector fields V with V 1. However Vk D f l V is a k covector field of norm no more than Vk D f l , so f l B B Vk D f l d l B

Chunk: it seems that invariant currents also have an imporant role to play. We will show under mild conditions that if some degree one cohomological class of a smooth self map f of a compact manifold is invariant and expanded there is necessarily a invariant degree one current of a certain type representing that class. We obtain analogous results for higher degree currents given bounds on the local growth rates of f. The uniqueness of these classes is significant. It seems clear that one could modify a map locally near a fixed point to obtain other invariant currents of the same type without affecting the topology. Thus our results also say that any local modification that created an invariant current of the given type must violate the local growth conditions. In other words, as long as things do not grow too fast compared to the growth rate of the cohomology class, the expansion of the cohomology class gives sufficient marching orders to points that no other invariant cohomological class of the given type can be created by purely local dynamical behavior. Our results give explicit conditions under which uniqueness is guaranteed. For degree one currents, no restriction on local growth rates is necessary for our results. 2 Cohomomorphisms We will make use of sheaves in this paper. There are two standard def initions of sheaves on a topological space X, one as a topological space Bre97 , GR84 , and one as a functor on the category TopX satisfying var ious axioms Har77 , Wei97 . Since we will often want to make use of a topology on sections of a sheaf A that differs from the topology these inherit using the topological definition of a sheaf, we will instead use the functor definition of a sheaf. Our sheaves will always be sheaves of K modules over some fixed field K. We will require that K have an absolute value for which K is complete. Given a continuous map f X Y and sheaves A and B on X and Y respectively, an f cohomomorphism is a generalized notion of a pullback from B to A through f. Different types of geometric objects pull back differently, and this allows us to handle all cases at once. We take the following facts from from Bre97 page 14 15. Definition 1. If A and B are sheaves on X and Y then an f cohomomorphism 3 k B A is a collection of homomorphisms kU B U A f 1 U , for U open in Y , compatible with restrictions. Note that if A is a sheaf on X and f X Y is continuous then there is a canonical cohomomorphism f A A where f A is the direct image of A , i.e. given an open U Y , f A U A f 1 U . Remark. Given a continuous map f X Y of topological spaces X and Y and sheaves A and B on X and Y respectively, all f cohomomorphisms f B A are given by a composition of the form B j f A f A where j B f A is a sheaf homomorphism, and each such composition is seen to given an f cohomomorphism. The usual notion of a morphism of sheaves on X is the same as an idX cohomomorphism of sheaves on X. 2.1 Cohomomorphisms and . The functor returns the global sections of that sheaf. Given a morphism A A of sheaves on X, is just the homomorphism A X A X . Given sheaves A and B on X and Y and given f X Y continuous then for a sheaf cohomomorphism F B A one defines F to be the homomorphism B Y A X . This extends to be a functor on the category of topological spaces with an associated sheaf where morphisms are given by cohomomorphisms.

Chunk: C is a topological vector space over K. If a sequence Ci C of divisors converges to another divisor C then the support of C is contained in the closure of the union of the supports of Ci. The maps fC and q are continuous. We are given a finite dimensional H1 fA invariant subspace W of the chronically expanding subspace of H1 X, A . We also require W to be comprised only of closed bundles. 2Meaning for each eigenvector we include not just the eigenspace, but also every v V such that g idV n v 0 for some positive integer n. 9 Then given any K linear map s W C such that W B satisfying lim k fC q where g W W is the inverse of H1fA W. Under iterated pullback the rescaled pullbacks of any divisor C C of a bundle w W converge toward the invariant plane of divisors W C . The map W C is the unique map making the diagram W g M M M M M M wo o o o B q fB C fC H1 X, A H1fA W M M M M M M wo o o o B q C H1 X, A commute. Finally, for any basepoint free eigenbundle v W the support of the corresponding invariant divisor v C is contained in the set of points on which f is cohomologically expansive for v. Proof. We note that fC sg s 0 and so there is a map W B such that q fC sg s. Define Hom W, B Hom W, B by fB g 1. We will show that the sequence of maps k is exponentially contracting on Hom W, B . Fix a norm on W. The assumption that W lies in the chronically expanding subspace of H1 X, A implies that there exists some and some w c k w for k N, w W. This with the assumption on the rate of expansion of fB easily implies that k w fB k g k w cd k w Thus k is an operator of norm no more than cd k , where . Letting 2 k then limk k converges to some map . It is easily confirmed that q fC ksg k s. Equa tion then follows by continuity of q. 10 The conclusions about the map are easy consequences of its definition. For the final conclusion note that if we just let W be the span of v then we have already shown that if C is the unique invariant member of C associated to v then for any divisor c C satisfying c v letting be the eigenvalue of v we can write c v q b and equation 3 becomes fC kc v q fB kb k where the final term goes to zero as k by our assumptions on growth rates of g 1 and fB . Hence fC k c k converges to v . If U is any open subset of X and if the support of c is disjoint from f n U for arbitrarily large values of n, then the support of fC n c must be disjoint from U for arbitrarily large values of n. Since, rescaled, these converge to c then U must lie outside the support of c. Remark. While we have not formally required X to be compact, the re quirement that B be a Banach space makes this the main case in which Theorem 12 is apt to have interesting applications. Theorem 12 shows that among all members of C representing a coho mology class in W there is a unique invariant linear subspace which can be identified with W and all other such members of C are contracted to this invariant copy of W in C under rescaled pullback. Corollary 13. Assume that

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0070v1 cond mat.mes hall 1 Apr 2007 Coincidence of the oscillations in the dipole transition and in the persistent current of narrow quantum rings with two electrons Y. Z. He and C. G. Bao State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, and Department of Physics, Sun Yat Sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, P.R. China The fractional Aharonov Bohm oscillation FABO of narrow quantum rings with two electrons has been studied and has been explained in an analytical way, the evolution of the period and amplitudes against the magnetic field can be exactly described. Furthermore, the dipole transition of the ground state was found to have essentially two frequencies, their difference appears as an oscillation matching the oscillation of the persistent current exactly. A number of equalities relating the observables and dynamical parameters have been found. PACS numbers 73.23.Ra, 78.66. w The corresponding author Quantum rings containing only a few electrons can be now fabricated in laboratories1,2. When a magnetic field B is applied, interesting physical phenomena, e.g., Aharonov Bohm oscillation ABO and fractional ABO FABO of the ground state GS energy Eo and persis tent current Jo, have been observed 2 4,13. In the the oretical aspect, a number of calculations based on exact diagonalization5 8, local spin density approximation9,10, and the diffusion Monte Carlo method11 have been performed. These calculations can in general repro duce the experimental data. For examples, in the calculation of 4 electron ring6,11, the period of oscilla tion 0 4 found in experiments was recovered . In addition to the oscillations in Eo and Jo, the oscil lation in the optical properties is noticeable.16,17. In this paper a new kind of oscillation found in the dipole tran sition of two electron 2 e narrow rings is reported. The emitted absorbed photon of the dipole transition of the GS was found to have essentially two energies, their dif ference is exactly equal to hJo, where h is the Planck s constant. In other words the difference of the two photon energies appears as an oscillation which matches exactly the oscillation of Jo. This finding is approved by both numerical calculation and analytical analysis as follows. The narrow 2 e ring is first considered as one dimensional, then the effect of the width of the ring is further evaluated afterward. The Hamiltonian reads N P i j 2, 2 2m R2 where m the effective mass, j the azimuthal an gle of the j th electron, R2B 0, where B is a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the ring, V12 the e e Coulomb interaction, the well known Zeeman energy where SZ is the Z component of the total spin S, and g B R2 0 , where g is the effective g factor and B is the Bohr magneton. The interaction is adjusted as 7 2 q d2 R2 sin2 1 2 2 1, where is the di electric constant and the parameter d is introduced to account for the effect of finite thickness of the ring. We first perform a numerical calculation so that all related quantities can be evaluated quantitatively. .063me, 12.4 for InGaAs , .05R , and the units meV , nm , T esla and 0 are used. Accordingly, .8 R2,and 33.53 R2. A set of basis functions k1 1 k2 2 2 is in troduced to diagonalize the Hamiltonian, where k1 and k2 must be integers to assure the periodicity, the sum of k1 and k2 is just the total orbital angular momentum L. k1k2 must be further anti symmetrized when . When about three thousand basis functions are adopted, accurate solutions at least six effective digits can be ob tained. The low lying spectrum is plotted in Fig.1, where the oscillation of the GS energy and the transition of the GS angular momentum Lo can be clearly seen. Let 2 1 2 , and 2 1. Then

Chunk: 1 2G i C 2 2 HZeeman and i 2 V12, they are for the collective and internal motions, respectively. Our numerical results lead to the following points. i Separability The separability of one dimensional ring is well known5. However, for the convenience of the following description, it is briefly summarized as follows. Each eigenenergy E can be exactly divided as a sum of three terms L 2 2 Eint SZ where the first term is the kinetic energy of collective motion, Eint is the internal energy . Since the basis functions can be rewritten as 2 Cei 1 2 k2 k1 2 the spatial part of each eigenstate is strictly separa ble as 1 2 eiL C int where the first part describes the collective motion, while int is a normalized internal state depending only on .

When is positive, Lo is negative, the num bers by the curves are Lo. ii Classification of int When L is even odd , k2 k1 2 is an integer half integer , thus the period of as shown in is 2 4 . Therefore, the periodicity of the internal states have two choices. In fact, the difference in the periodicity is closely related to the dependence of the domains of the new variables C and , this point has been discussed in detail in ref. . Let 1 L, then the four cases Q, S 1,0 , 1,0 , 1,1 and 1,1 are associated with four types of states labeled by a, b, c, and d , respectively. The internal states of Type a are denoted as a, a , and the associated internal energies as , and so on. Examples of int and Eint are plotted in Fig.2 and listed in Table 1, respectively.

In Fig.2 the patterns of Type a are one to one similar to Type c , they all have a peak at the DB. On the contrary, all those of Type b and d have the inherent node at the DB. It is noticeable that Type b and c are not continuous at 0 and 2 due to their periods are not equal to 2 . It was found that the internal states of all the GSs are either a or c without exceptions because the favorable DB is allowed in them. When the dynamical parame ters vary

To compare with 1 e rings, the latter has 2hJo Eq. demonstrates that the os cillation of and the oscillation of Jo are matched with each other exactly, they keep strictly proportional to each other during the variation of .

Under this model we have performed numerical calculation to obtain and hJo, where Jo is now the total angular current inside the ring from ra to rb . The result is shown in Fig.4 where 120 are assumed, and the two quantities are slightly different from each 5 other. However, when the width becomes smaller, say rb , the two curves overlap. Thus works not only for one dimensional but also for two dimensional narrow rings. Let us define p m AB max. For one dimensional rings and from , we have , where R is the radius of the ring. For two dimensional rings, it was found from our numerical calculation that r rb ra 2 if rb . E.g., when 70, .03. When 90, .00. Thus works also well for two dimensional narrow rings if the R in G is replaced by the average radius. It is noted that the band structure and related optical properties of 2 e rings have already been studied in de tail by Wendler and coauthors18. They classify the eigen states according to their radial motion, relative angular motion, and collective rotation. In our paper the relative angular motion is further classified into four types ac cording to the inherent nodal structures and periodicity of their wave functions, i.e., according to whether the DB shape is allowed and whether the wave function is contin uous at 2 . The DB accessibility turns out to be im portant because it affects the eigenenergies decisively. In fact, the classification of states based on inherent nodal structures was found to be crucial in atomic physics,19 this would be also true in two dimensional systems. Fur thermore, the rule of selection for the dipole transition has been proposed in ref. . In our paper, an addi tional rule namely,eq. is further proposed based on the possible transition of internal structures. This rule would affect the dipole spectrum seriously because

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0073v3 math.AG 5 Mar 2012 A TRANSCENDENTAL APPROACH TO KOLL AR S INJECTIVITY THEOREM OSAMU FUJINO Abstract. We treat Koll ar s injectivity theorem from the ana lytic or differential geometric viewpoint. More precisely, we give a curvature condition which implies Koll ar type cohomology injec tivity theorems. Our main theorem is formulated for a compact K ahler manifold, but the proof uses the space of harmonic forms on a Zariski open set with a suitable complete K ahler metric. We need neither covering tricks, desingularizations, nor Leray s spec tral sequence. Contents 1. Introduction 1 2. Preliminaries 6 3. Proof of the main theorem 11 4.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0074v2 math.RA 21 Aug 2007 Injective Morita Contexts Revisited Dedicated to Prof. Robert Wisbauer J. Y. Abuhlail S. K. Nauman Department of Mathematics Statistics Department of Mathematics King Fahd University of Petroleum King AbdulAziz University Minerals, Box 5046 P.O.Box 80203 31261 Dhahran KSA 21589 Jeddah KSA abuhlail kfupm.edu.sa synakhaled hotmail.com Abstract This paper is an exposition of the so called injective Morita contexts in which the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective and Morita contexts in which the connecting bimodules enjoy some local projectivity in the sense of Zimmermann Huisgen . Motivated by situations in which only one trace ideal is in action, or the compatibility between the bimodule morphisms is not needed, we introduce the notions of Morita semi contexts and Morita data, and investigate them. Injective Morita data will be used with the help of static and adstatic modules to establish equivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategories of cat egories of modules that are localized or colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum. We end up with applications of Morita contexts to modules and injective right wide Morita contexts. 1 Introduction Morita contexts, in general, and semi strict Morita contexts with surjective con necting bilinear morphisms , in particular, were extensively studied and developed expo nentially during the last few decades e.g. AGH Z1997 . However, we sincerely feel that there is a gap in the literature on injective Morita contexts i.e. those with injective con necting bilinear morphisms . Apart from the results in Nau1994 a , Nau1994 b where the second author initially explored this notion and from an application to Grothendieck groups in the recent paper Nau2004 , it seems that injective Morita contexts were not studied systematically at all. Corresponding Author 1 We noticed that in several results of Nau1993 , Nau1994 a and Nau1994 b that are related to Morita contexts, only one trace ideal is used. Observing this fact, we introduce the notions of Morita semi contexts and Morita data and investigate them. Several results are proved then for injective Morita semi contexts and or injective Morita data. Consider a Morita datum T, S, P, Q, , T, , S , with not necessarily compat ible bimodule morphisms , T P S Q T and , S Q T P S. We say that M is injective, iff , T and , S are injective, and to be a Morita datum, iffthe associated dual pairings Pl Q, TP , Pr Q, PS , Ql P, SQ and Qr P, QT satisfy the condition which is closely related to the notion of local projectivity in the sense of Zimmermann Huisgen Z H1976 . The condition was introduced in AG TL2001 and further investigated by the first author in Abu2005 . While semi strict unital Morita contexts induce equivalences between the whole mod ule categories of the rings under consideration, we show in this paper how injective Morita semi contexts and injective Morita data play an important role in establishing equiva lences between suitable intersecting subcategories of module categories e.g. intersections of subcategories that are localized colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum with sub categories of static adstatic modules, etc. . Our main applications in addition to equiv alences related to the Kato Ohtake M uller localization colocalization theory developed in Kat1978 , KO1979 and M ul1974 , will be to modules introduced by Menini and Or satti MO1989 and to right wide Morita contexts introduced by F. Casta no Iglesias and J. G omez Torrecillas C IG T1995 . Most of our results will be stated for left modules, while deriving the dual versions for right modules will be left for the reader.

Chunk: reader, we tried to make the paper self contained, so that it can serve as a reference on injective Morita semi contexts and their applications. In this respect, and for the sake of completeness, we have included some previous results of the authors that are in most cases either provided with new shorter proofs, or are obtained under weaker conditions. This paper is organized as follows After this brief introduction, we give in Section 2 some preliminaries including the basic properties of dual pairings, which play a central role in rest of the work. The notions of Morita semi contexts and Morita data are intro duced in Section 3, where we clarify their relations with the dual pairings and the so called elementary rngs. Injective Morita semi contexts appear in Section 4, where we study their interplay with dual pairings and provide some examples and a counter example. In Section 5 we include some observations regarding static and adstatic modules and use them to obtain equivalences among suitable intersecting subcategories of modules related to a Morita semi context. In the last section, more applications are presented, mainly to subcategories of modules that are localized or colocalized by a trace ideal of an injective Morita semi context, to modules and to injective right wide Morita contexts. 2 2 Preliminaries Throughout, R denotes a commutative ring with 1R 0R and A, A , B, B are unital R algebras. We have reserved the term ring for an associative ring with a multiplicative unity, and we will use the term rng for a general associative ring not necessarily with unity . All modules over rings are assumed to be unitary, and ring morphisms are assumed to respect multiplicative unities. If T and S are categories, then we write T S T S to mean that T is a full subcategory of S, and T S to indicate that T and S are equivalent. Rngs and their modules 2.1. By an A rng T, T , we mean an A, A bimodule T with an A, A bilinear mor phism T T A T T, such that T T A idT T idT A T . We call an A rng T, T an A ring, iffthere exists in addition an A, A bilinear morphism T A T, called the unity map, such that T T A idT l T and T idT A T r T where A A T l T T and T A A r T T are the canonical isomorphisms . So, an A ring is a unital A rng and an A rng is roughly speaking an A ring not necessarily with unity. 2.2. A morphism of rngs T A T A consists of a morphism of R algebras A A and an A, A bilinear morphism T T , such that T A,A T ,T A T where A,A T ,T T A T T A T is the canonical map induced by . By RNG we denote the category of associative rngs with morphisms being rng morphisms, and by non full subcategory of unital rings with morphisms being the morphisms in RNG which respect multiplicative unities. 2.3. Let T, T be an A rng. By a left T module we mean a left A module N with a left A linear morphism N T T A N N, such that N T T A idN N T idT A N T . For left T modules M, N, we call a left A linear morphism f M N a T linear morphism, ifff tm tf m for all t T. The category of left T modules and left T linear morphisms is denoted by TM. The category MT of right T modules is defined analogously. Let T A and T A be rngs. We call an A, A bimodule N a T, T bimodule, iff N,

Chunk: N T is a left T module and N, N T is a right T module, such that N T N T A idT N T idT A N T . For T, T bimodules M, N, we call an A, A bilinear morphism f M N T, T bilinear, provided f is left T linear and right T linear. The category of T, T bimodules is denoted by TMT . In particular, for any A rng T, a left right T module M has a canonical structure of a unitary right left S module, where S End TM op S End MT and moreover, with this structure M becomes a T, S bimodule an S, T bimodule . Remark 2.4. Similarly, one can define rngs over arbitrary not necessarily unital ground rngs and rng morphisms between them. Moreover, one can define bi modules over such rngs and bi linear morphisms between them. 3 Notation. Let T be an A rng. We write TU UT to denote that U is a left right T module. For a left right T module TU, we consider the set U HomT U, T U Hom T U, T of all left right T linear morphisms from U to T with the canonical right left T module structure. Generators and cogenerators Definition 2.5. Let T be an A rng. For a left T module TU consider the following sub classes of TM Gen TU Cogen TU Pres TU Copres TU A left T module in Gen TU respectively Cogen TU , Pres TU , Copres TU is said to be U generated respectively U cogenerated, U presented, U copresented . Moreover, we say that TU is a generator respectively cogenerator, presentor, copresentor , iff Gen TU TM respectively Cogen TU TM, Pres TU TM, Copres TU TM . Dual pairings In what follows we recall the definition and properties of dual pairings introduced in AG TL2001, Definition 2.3. and studied further in Abu2005 . 2.6. Let T be an A rng. A dual left T pairing V, TW consists of a left T module W and a right T module V with a right T linear morphism Pl V W equivalently a left T linear morphism Pl W V . For dual left pairings V, TW , P V , T W , a morphism of dual left pairings , V , W V, W consists of a triple , V, TW V , T W , where V V and W W are T linear and T T is a morphism of rngs, such that considering the induced maps , T V W T and , T V W T we v , w T v, w T for all v V and w W . The dual left pairings with the morphisms defined above build a category, which we denote by Pl. With Pl T Pl we denote the full subcategory of dual T pairings. The category Pr of dual right pairings and its full subcategory Pr T Pr of dual right T pairings are defined analogously. 4 Remark 2.7. The reader should be warned that in general for a non commutative rng T and a dual left T pairing V, TW , the following map induced by the right T linear morphism Pl V W , T V W T, v, Pl v w is not necessarily T balanced, and so does not induce in general a map V T W T. In fact, for all v V, w W and t T we , Pl vt w Pl v t w Pl v w v, v, Pl v tw t Pl v w , . 2.8. Let T be an A rng, N, W be left T modules and identify NW with the set of all mappings from W to N. Considering N with the discrete topology and NW with

Chunk: P S Q T , S Q T P S are compatible, in the sense , , q T and , p S p, p, p P, q, q Q, then we call M a Morita context. If T, S in a Morita datum context M are unital, then we call M a unital Morita datum context . 3.5. Let T A , S B , P, Q, , T, , S and M T A , S B , P , Q , , T , , S be Morita contexts. Extending Ami1971, Page 275 , we mean by a mor phism of Morita contexts from M to M a four fold set of maps , , , T A , S B , P, Q T A , S B , P , Q , where T A T A , S B S B are rng morphisms, P P is T, S bilinear and Q Q is S, T bilinear, such that p, p , q T and q, q , p S p P, q Q. By MC we denote the category of Morita contexts with morphisms defined as above, and by non full subcategory of unital Morita contexts. 8 Example 3.6. If R is commutative, then any Morita semi context R, R, P, Q, , R yields a Morita context R, R, P, Q, , R, , R , where , R Q R P P R Q , R R. 3.7. We call a Morita semi context T, S, P, Q, , T semi derived derived , iffS End TP op and . We call a Morita datum, or a Morita context, T, S, P, Q, , T, , S semi derived derived , TP op, or PS TP op and , or PS and . Remark 3.8. Following Cae1998, 1.2. however, dropping the condition that the bilinear map , T P S Q T is surjective , Morita semi contexts T, S, P, Q, T in our sense were called dual pairs in Ver2006 . However, we think the terminology we are using is more informative and avoids confusion with other notions of dual pairings in the literature e.g. the ones studied by the first author in Abu2005 . The reason for this specific terminology i.e. Morita semi contexts is that every Morita context contains two Morita semi contexts as clear from the definition and that any Morita semi context can be extended to a not necessarily unital Morita context in a natural way as explained below. Elementary rngs In what follows we demonstrate how to build new Morita semi contexts from a given Morita semi context. These constructions are inspired by the notion of elementary rngs in Cae1998, 1.2. and Ver2006, Remark 3.8. Lemma 3.9. Let mT T A , S B , P, Q, , T MSC. 1. The T, T bimodule T P S Q has a structure of a T rng A rng with multipli cation p S q T p S q p, S q p, p P, q, q Q, such that , T T T is a morphism of A rngs, P is a T, S bimodule and Q is an S, T bimodule, where p S q ep p, p S q , . Moreover, we have morphisms of T rngs A rngs T End PS , p S q 7 ep 7 p, T End SQ op, p S q 7 eq 7 , , T A , S B , P, Q, idT MSC and we have a morphism of Morita semi contexts , T, idS, , idP, idQ T, S, P, Q, idT T, S, P, Q, , T . 9 2.

Queries:
1. What are the conditions for two Morita contexts to be compatible?
2. What is the definition of a unital Morita datum context?
3. What is the category of Morita contexts and its subcategory of unital Morita contexts?

The chunk refers to "Morita contexts" and the compatibility conditions between them. Specifically, it mentions that T and S in a Morita datum context M are compatible in a certain way. The second point refers to the definition of a unital Morita datum context, which is also defined in the chunk. Lastly, the chunk refers to the category of Morita contexts and its subcategory of unital Morita contexts. As such, the three search queries are crafted around these points. They aim to understand the compatibility conditions of two Morita contexts, the definition of a unital Morita datum context, and the distinction between the category of Morita contexts and its subcategory of unital Morita contexts.

Moreover, we have morphisms of S rngs B rngs S End TP op, q T p 7 ep 7 ep, , S End QT , q T p 7 eq 7 , , and M T A , S B , P, Q, , T, idS is a Morita context. Remarks 3.10. 1. Given S B , T A , Q, P, , S MSC, the S, S bimodule S Q T P becomes an S rng with multiplication q T p S q T p q, T p p, p P, q, q Q and the T, T bimodule T P S Q becomes a T rng with multiplication p S q T p S q , p S S q p , p S q p, p P, q, q Q. Analogous results to those in Lemma 3.9 can be obtained for the S rng S and the T rng T. 2. Given a Morita semi context T, S, P, Q, , T several equivalent conditions for the T rng T P S Q to be unital and the modules TP, QT to be firm can be found in Ver2006, Theorem 3.3. . Analogous results can be formulated for the S rng Q T P and the S modules PS, SQ corresponding to any S, T, Q, P, , S MSC. Proposition 3.11. 1. Let T, S, P, Q, , T UMSC and assume the A rng T P S Q to be unital. If , T T T respects unities and mT is injective , then , T is surjective T , T T as A rings . 2. Let S, T, Q, P, , S UMSC and assume the B rng S Q S P to be unital. If , S S S respects unities and mS is injective , then , S is surjective S , S S as B rings . 3. Let T, S, P, Q, , T, , S UMC and assume the rngs T P S Q, T, S Q S P to be unital. If , T P S Q T and , S S S respect unities, then T , T T as A ring, S , S S as B rings and we have equivalences of categories TM SM and MT MS . 10 Proof. Assume T is unital with 1 pi S qi. If , T respects unities, then we have Xn pi, 1T, and so for any t T we get Xn pi, Xn tpi, , T . One can prove 2 analogously. As for 3 , it is well known that a unital Morita context with surjective connecting bimodule morphisms is strict e.g. Fai1981, 12.7. , hence T , T T, S , S S. The equivalences of categories TM TM SM SM and MT MT MS MS follow then by classical Morita Theory e.g. Fai1981, Chapter 12 . Definition 3.12. Let T be an A rng, VT a right T module and consider for every left T module TL the annihilator ann L VT . Following AF1974, Exercises 19 , we say VT is L faithful, iffann L VT 0 and to be completely faithful, iffVT is L faithful for every left T module SL. Similarly, we can define completely faithful left T modules. Under suitable conditions, the following result characterizes the Morita data, which are Morita contexts Proposition 3.13. Let T, S, P, Q, , T, , S be a Morita datum. 1. If M MC, then S id S and T id T as rngs. 2. Assume TP is Q faithful and

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0075v3 hep ph 20 Apr 2007 Strong decays of charmed baryons Chong Chen, Xiao Lin Chen, Xiang Liu, Wei Zhen Deng, and Shi Lin Zhu Department of physics, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China Dated February 21, 2013 There has been important experimental progress in the sector of heavy baryons in the past several years. We study the strong decays of the S wave, P wave, D wave and radially excited charmed baryons using the 3P0 model. After comparing the calculated decay pattern and total width with the available data, we discuss the possible internal structure and quantum numbers of those charmed baryons observed recently. PACS numbers 13.30.Eg, 12.39.Jh I. INTRODUCTION Babar and Belle collaborations observed sev eral excited charmed baryons c 2880, 2940 , c 2980, 3077 ,0 and c 0 last year , which inspired several investigations of these states in literature . We collect the experimental information of these recently observed hadrons in Table I. Their quantum numbers have not been determined except c . In order to understand their struc tures using the present experimental information, we study the strong decay pattern of the excited charmed baryons systematically in this work. In the past decades, there has been some research work on heavy baryons . The quantum numbers and decay widths of S wave and some P wave charmed baryons are known . We first systematically analyze their strong decays in the frame work of the 3P0 strong decay model. Accordingly one can extract the parameters and estimate the accuracy of the 3P0 model when it s applied in the charmed baryon system. Then we go one step further and extend the same formalism to study the decay patterns of these new charmed baryons c 2880, 2940 , 2980, 3077 ,0 un der different assignments of their quantum numbers. Af ter comparing the theoretical results with the available experimental data, we can learn their favorable quantum numbers and assignments in the quark model.

With the newly observed particles or the predicted particles given by CDF collaboration , we revisit the decay patterns of these recently observed excited charmed baryons under different assignment assignments for their quantum numbers. The parameters and probabilities for these decays in the 3P0 model are presented in detail . We find the calculated decay patterns of the S wave , P wave , D wave and radially excited charmed baryons are in consistent with available experimental data . We also analyze their possible internal structure and quantum numbers by comparing the calculated total width and decay pattern with experimental data.

Chunk: mass frame. 1 BC is a statistical factor which is needed if B and C are identical particles. IV. THE STRONG DECAYS OF CHARMED BARYON According to the 3P0 model, the decay occurs through the recombination of the five quarks from the initial charmed baryon and the created quark pair. So there are three ways of regrouping A q1, q2, c3 P q4, q5 B q2, q4, c3 C q1, q5 , A q1, q2, c3 P q4, q5 B q1, q4, c3 C q2, q5 , A q1, q2, c3 P q4, q5 B q1, q2, q4 C c3, q5 where qi and c3 denote the light quark and charm quark respectively. When the excited charmed baryon decays into a charmed baryon plus a light meson as shown in Eq. and , the total decay amplitude reads M MJA MJB p 8EAEBEC X M A X MLA X M B X MLB X m1,m3,m4,m 1,4,3 B 2,5 C 4,5 0 1,2,3 A I MLA,m MLB ,MLC p , where the pre factor 2 in front of arises from the fact that the amplitude from the Eq. is the same as that from Eq. . The overlap integral in the momentum space is I MLA,m MLB ,MLC p 3 PB PC Z d3p1d3p2 B l B, m B, l B, m B C LC MLC Ym 1 p4 p5 2 A l A, m A, l A, m A . Since all hadrons in the final states are S wave in this work, eq. can be further expressed as I MLA,m MLB ,MLC p 3 PB PC l A, m A, l A, m A, m , where we have used the harmonic oscillator wave func tions for both the meson and baryon. The expressions of l A, m A, l A, m A, m for the decays of S wave, P wave and D wave charmed baryons are collected in the Appendix. We also move the lengthy expressions of mo 5 mentum space integration of S wave, P wave and D wave charmed baryons to the Appendix. V. NUMERICAL RESULTS The decay widths of charmed baryons from the 3P0 model involve several parameters the strength of quark pair creation from vacuum , the R value in the harmonic oscillator wave function of meson and the , in the baryon wave functions. We follow the convention of Ref. and take 13.4, which is considered as a universal parameter in the 3P0 model. The R value of and K mesons is 2.1 GeV 1 while it s .3 GeV 1 for the D meson . 0.5 GeV for the proton and . For S wave charmed baryons, the parameters and in the harmonic oscillator wave functions can be fixed to reproduce the mass splitting through the contact term in the potential model . Their values are 0.6 GeV and 0.6 GeV. For P wave and D wave charmed baryons, and are expected to lie in the range 0.5 0.7 GeV. In the following, our numerical results are obtained with the typical values 0.6 GeV. The strong decay widths of the S wave charmed baryons , ,0 c , , ,0 c and ,0 c are listed in Table II. Accordingly the decay widths of S wave bottomed baryons are presented in Table III. Be cause b, b and b have not been observed so far, their masses are taken from the theoretical estimate in Ref. , which are m .7 MeV, m .1 MeV. The quantum number and internal structure of the following P wave charmed baryons c , c , ,0 c and ,0 c are relatively known exper imentally . Their strong decay modes and widths from the 3P0 model are collected in Table IV. The quan tum number of c is still unknown . Thus under different P wave assignments of c , we present the strong decay

The error in rc does not include an uncertainty from assuming factorization for SU breaking in T C . While this assumption should hold well for T , it may not be a good approximation for C which as we have mentioned is comparable in magnitude to T and carries a strong phase relative to it. Thus one should allow a 10 theoretical error when using factorization for relating B K and B T C amplitudes, so that .20 0.01 exp 0.02 th . Eliminating c in Eqs. and by retaining terms which are linear in rc, one finds Rc 1 cos EW 2 ACP B K 0 sin 2rc 2 O r3 c . This sum rule implies that at least one of the two terms whose squares occur on the left hand side must be sizable, of the order of .4. The second term, ACP B K 0 sin , is already smaller than 0.1, using the current 2 bounds on and ACP B K 0 . Thus, the first term must provide a dominant contribution. For Rc 1, this implies arccos EW 53.1 3.5 . This range is expanded by including errors in Rc and ACP B K 0 . For instance, an upper bound .1 would imply an inportant upper limit, 70 . Currently one only obtains an upper limit 88 at 90 confidence level.95 This bound is consistent with the value obtained in from B and B , but is not competitive with the latter precision. Conclusion The current constraint obtained from Rc and ACP B K 0 is 88 at 90 confidence level. Further improvement in the measurement of Rc which may, in fact, be very close to one is required in order to achieve a precision in comparable to that obtained in B , .

Gronau matrix elements.86 In this language, the amplitudes for B0 decays into pairs of charged or neutral pions, and pairs of charged or neutral and K, are given by A B0 T P 2P c EW 3 E PA , 2A B0 0 0 C P PEW P c EW 3 E PA , A B0 K T P 2P c EW 3 , 2A B0 K0 0 C P P EW P c EW 3 . The combination E PA, representing exchange and penguin annihilation topolo gies, is expected to be 1 mb suppressed relative to T and C,31,62 as demonstrated by the small branching ratio measured for B0 K K .20 This term will be neglected. Expressing topological amplitudes in terms of CKM factors, SU invariant amplitudes and SU invariant strong phases, one may write T V ubVud T Puc , P 2P c EW 3 V tbVtd Ptc ei , T V ubVus T Puc , P 2P c EW 3 V tbVts Ptc ei , C V ubVud C Puc , P PEW P c EW 3 V tbVtd Ptc ei , C V ubVus C Puc , P P EW P c EW 3 V tbVts Ptc ei . Unitarity of the CKM matrix, V cbVcd s V tbVtd s V ubVud s , has been used to absorb in T and C a penguin term Puc Pu Pc multiplying V ubVud s , while Ptc Pt Pc and Ptc Pt Pc contain two distinct combinations of EWP contributions. Using the identity Im V ubVudVtbV td Im V ubVusVtbV ts , one finds103,104 B0 K B0 B0 K0 0 B0 0 0 , where is the CP rate difference defined in . Quoting products of branching ratios and asymmetries from Tables I and II, Eq. reads 1.88 0. .96 0.37 . This SU relation works well and requires no SU breaking. An SU breaking factor fK f in T but not in P, or in both T and P, are currently excluded at a level of 1.0 , or 1.75 . More precise CP asymmetry measurements in B0 K and B0 are required for determining the pattern of SU breaking in tree and penguin amplitudes. Using the prediction of the B K asymmetry sum rule, Eq. predicts ACP B0 0 0 1.07 0.38 . The error is dominated by current errors in CP asymmetries for B K0 and B K 0, and to a less extent by the error in 0 0 . SU breaking in January 4, 2014 0 41 WSPC INSTRUCTION FILE CP review CP violation in beauty decays 17 amplitudes could modify this prediction by a factor f fK if this factor applies to C, and less likely by f fK 2. A large positive CP asymmetry, favored in all three cases, will affect future applications of the isospin analysis in B . It implies that while the B isospin triangle is roughly equal sided, the B triangle is squashed. A twofold ambiguity in the value of disappears in the limit of a flat B triangle.24 Conclusion The isospin sum rule for B K decay rates holds well, while

Chunk: B decays to corresponding charge conjugate final states are therefore given by we omit inessential common kinematic factors , B A 2 , B A 2 , B A 2 , B A 2 . January 4, 2014 0 41 WSPC INSTRUCTION FILE CP review 20 M. Gronau The amplitudes B and A are related to B and A by a change in sign of all weak phases, whereas strong phases are left unchanged. For each pair of processes one defines four asymmetries an isospin dependent CP conserving asymmetry, AI 0 0 0 0 , two CP violating asymmetries for B and B0, A CP , C A0 CP 0 0 0 0 , and the time dependent asymmetry S in B0 decays, 1 2 , CP B A B Ae 2i , In the Standard Model, the isoscalar amplitude B contains a dominant penguin contribution, BP , with a CKM factor V cbVcs. The residual isoscalar amplitude, B B BP , and the amplitude A, consist each of contributions smaller than BP by about an order of magnitude.29,30,31,32,86 These contributions include terms with a much smaller CKM factor V ubVus, and a higher order electroweak penguin amplitude with CKM factor V tbVts. Thus, one expects B BP , A BP . Consequently, the asymmetries AI, A ,0 CP and S are expected to be small, of or der 2 A B and 2 B BP . In contrast, potentially large contributions to B and A from NP, comparable to BP , would most likely lead to large asymmetries of order one. An unlikely exception is the case when both B BP and A BP are purely imaginary, or almost purely imaginary. This would require very special cir cumstances such as fine tuning in specific models. Excluding cancellations between NP and SM contributions in both CP conserving and CP violating asymmetries, tests for the hierarchy become tests for the smallness of corresponding potential NP contributions to B and A. There exists ample experimental information showing that asymmetries A CP are small in processes related by isospin reflection to the decay modes in Table III. Upper limits on the magnitudes of most asymmetries are at a level of ten or fifteen percent e.g., A CP K 0.034 0.044, A CP K 0.031 0.026 , while others may be as large as twenty or thirty percent A CP K 0 0.31 0.11 0.10 . Similar values have been measured for isospin asymmetries AI e.g., AI K 0.037 0.077, AI K 0.001 0.033, AI K 0 0.16 0.10 .49 Since these two types of asymmetries are of order 2 B BP and 2 A BP , this confirms the hierarchy , which can be assumed to hold also in the presence of NP. January 4, 2014 0 41 WSPC INSTRUCTION FILE CP review CP violation in beauty decays 21 We will take by convention the dominant penguin amplitude BP to have a zero weak phase and a zero strong phase, referring all other strong phases to it. Writing , B , and expanding the four asymmetries to leading order in B BP or A BP , one has Im A A BP Im B B BP , A A BP , A A A BP Re B B BP , A0 A A BP Re B B BP . The four asymmetries provide the following information The 1 contributions in CP asymmetries are separated by taking sums and differences, A A CP A0 CP Re B B BP , A A CP A0 CP Re A A BP . ReA BP and Re A BP may be separated by using information from A . S is governed by an imaginary part of a combination of 1 terms which cannot be separated in B decays. Such a separation is possible in Bs decays to pairs of isospin reflected decays, e.g. Bs K K ,

Chunk: KSKS or Bs K K , K 0 K 0, where 2 in the definition of S is now replaced by the small phase of Bs Bs mixing. One may take one step further under the assumption that strong phases as sociated with NP amplitudes are small relative to those of the SM and can be neglected.110 This assumption, which must be confronted by data, is reasonable because rescattering from a leading b sc c amplitude is likely the main source of strong phases, while rescattering from a smaller b sq q NP amplitude is then a second order effect. In the convention , where the strong phase of BP is set equal to zero, B and A have the same CP conserving strong phase , and involve CP violating phases B and A, respectively, B ei ei B , A ei ei A . Since the four asymmetries are first order in small ratios of amplitudes, one may take BP in their expression to be given by the square root of or 0, thereby neglecting second order terms. These four observables can then be shown to January 4, 2014 0 41 WSPC INSTRUCTION FILE CP review 22 M. Gronau determine A , A and B sin B.49 The combination B cos B adds coherently to BP and cannot be fixed independently. The amplitudes B and A consist of process dependent SM and potential NP contributions. Assuming that the former are calculable, either using methods based on QCD factorization or by fitting within flavor SU these and other B decay rates and asymmetries, the four asymmetries determine the magnitude and CP violating phase of a 0 NP amplitude. In certain cases, e.g., B K or B KS, stringent upper bounds on SM contributions to B and A may suffice if some of the four measured asymmetries are larger than permitted by these bounds. In the pair B K 0, B0 K0 0, the four measured asymmetries using the predicted value are .087 0.038, A 0.047 0.025, A 0.094 0.025, .35 0.21. Some reduction of errors is required for a useful implementation of this method. Conclusion There exists ample experimental evidence in pairs of isospin reflected b s penguin dominated decays that potential NP amplitudes must be small. Assuming that these amplitudes involve negligible strong phases, and assuming that small SM non penguin contributions are calculable or can be strictly bounded, one may determine the magnitude and CP violating phase of a NP , and the imaginary part of a NP . 6.5. Null or nearly null tests We have not discussed null tests of the CKM framework.111 Evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model may show up as small nonzero asymmetries in pro cesses where they are predicted to be extremely small in the CKM framework. A well known example is B 0, where the CP asymmetry is expected to be a small fraction of a percent including EWP amplitudes.34,35 We have only discussed exclusive hadronic B decays, where QCD calculations involve hadronic uncertain ties. A more robust calculation exists for the direct CP asymmetry in inclusive radiative decays B Xs , found to be smaller than one percent.112 The current upper limit on this asymmetry is at least an order of magnitude larger.113 Time dependent asymmetries in radiative decays B0 KS 0 , for a KS 0 invariant mass in the K region and for a larger invariant mass range including this region, are interesting because they test the photon helicity, predicted to be dominantly right handed in B0 decays and left handed in B0 decays.105,114 The asymmetry, suppressed by ms mb, is expected to be several percent in the SM, and can be very large in extensions where spin flip is allowed in b s . While dimensional arguments seem to indicate a possible larger asymmetry in the SM, of order QCD mb 10 ,115 calculations using perturbative

Chunk: choice of observ ables permits a determination of or 2 . 33 The same analysis applies in B decays to pairs of longitudinally polarized mesons. In case that an observable related to the subdominant penguin amplitude is not measured with sufficient precision, it may be replaced in the analysis by a CKM enhanced SU related observable, in which a large theoretical uncertainty is translated to a small January 4, 2014 0 41 WSPC INSTRUCTION FILE CP review 4 M. Gronau error in . The precision of this method is increased by including contributions of higher order electroweak penguin amplitudes, which are related by isospin to tree amplitudes.34,35 With sufficient statistics one should also take into account isospin breaking corrections of order md mu QCD 0.02,36,37 and an effect caused by the meson width.38 A similar analysis proposed for extracting in B K 39,40 requires using flavor SU instead of isospin for relating electroweak penguin con tributions and tree amplitudes.35,41 While flavor SU is usually assumed to be broken by corrections of order ms md QCD 0.3, in this particular case a rather precise recipe for SU breaking is provided by QCD factorization, reducing the theoretical uncertainty in to only a few degrees.42 Charmless B decays, which are sensitive to physics beyond the SM 28, provide a rich laboratory for studying various signatures of NP. A large variety of theories have been studied in this context, including supersymmetric models, models involving tree level flavor changing Z or Z couplings, models with anomalous three gauge boson couplings and other models involving an enhanced chromomagnetic dipole operator.43,44 The following effects have been studied and will be discussed in Section 6 in a model independent manner Within the SM, the three values of extracted from B , B K and B DK are equal. As we will explain, these three values are expected to be different in extensions of the SM involving new low energy four fermion operators behaving as and as K . Other signatures of anomalously large K are violations of isospin sum rules, holding in the SM for both decay rates and CP asymmetries in these decays.45,46,47 Time dependent asymmetries in B0 0KS, B0 KS and B0 KS and in other b s penguin dominated decays may differ substantially from the asymmetry sin 2 sin mt, predicted approximately in the SM.26,43,48 Significant deviations are expected in models involving anomalous S 1 operators behaving as 1. An interesting question, which may provide a clue to the underlying New Physics once deviations from SM predictions are observed, is how to diagnose the value of I in NP operators contributing to S 1 charmless B decays. We will discuss an answer to this question which has been proposed recently.49 3. Determining in B DK In this section we will discuss in some length a rather rich and very precise method for determining in processes of the form B D K , which uses both charged and neutral B mesons and a large variety of final states. It is based on a broad idea that any coherent admixture of a state involving a D0 from b cu s and a state with D0 from b uc s can decay to a common final state.24,25 The interference between the two channels, B D 0K , D0 fD and B D 0K , D0 January 4, 2014 0 41 WSPC INSTRUCTION FILE CP review CP violation in beauty decays 5 fD, involves the weak phase difference , which may be determined with a high theoretical precision using a suitable choice of measurements. Effects of D0 D0 mixing are negligible.50 While some of these processes are statistically limited, combining them together is expected to reduce the experimental error in . In addition to quasi two body B decays, the D or D in the final state may be accompanied by any multi body final state with quantum numbers

Chunk: of a kaon.25 Each process in this large class of neutral and charged B decays is characterized by two pairs of parameters, describing complex ratios of amplitudes for D0 and D0 for the two steps of the decay chain we use a convention rB, rf 0, 0 B, , A B D 0K A B D 0K rBei B , A D0 fD A D0 fD rfei f . In three body decays of B and D mesons, such as B DK and D K , the two pairs of parameters rB, B and rf, f are actually functions of two corresponding Dalitz variables describing the kinematics of the above three body decays. The sensitivity of determining depends on rB and rf because this determination relies on an interference of D0 and D0 amplitudes. For D decay modes with rf 1 see discussion below the sensitivity increases with the magnitude of rB. For each of the eight sub classes of processes, B ,0 D K ,0, one may study a variety of final states in neutral D decays. The states fD may be divided into four families, distinguished qualitatively by their parameters rf, f defined in Eq. ,25,51 K K , KS 0, etc. , , . K K , K K , etc. . K , K 0, etc. rf tan2 c. KS rf, f vary across the Dalitz plane. In the first family, CP odd states occur in Cabibbo favored D0 and D0 decays, while CP even states occur in singly Cabibbo suppressed decays. The second family of states occurs in singly Cabibbo suppressed decays, the third family occurs in Cabibbo favored D0 decays and in doubly Cabibbo suppressed D0 decays, while the last state is formally a Cabibbo favored mode for both D0 and D0. The parameters rB and B in B D K depend on whether the B meson is charged or neutral, and may differ for K vs K ,55 and for D vs D , where a neutral D can be observed in D D 0 or D D .56 The ratio rB involves a CKM factor VubVcs VcbVus 0.4 in both B and B0 decays, and a color suppression factor in B decays, while in B0 decays both b cu s and b uc s amplitudes are color suppressed. A rough estimate of the color suppression factor in these decays may be obtained from the color suppression measured in corresponding CKM favored decays, B D , D , D , D , where the suppression is found to be in the range 0.3 0.5.57 Thus, one expects rB B0 0.4, rB B 0.3 January 4, 2014 0 41 WSPC INSTRUCTION FILE CP review 6 M. Gronau 0.5 rB B0 in all the processes B ,0 D K ,0. We note that three body B decays, such as B D0K 0, are not color suppressed, making these processes advantageous by their potentially large value of rB which varies in phase space.58,59 The above comparison of rB B and rB B0 may be quantified more precisely by expressing the four ratios rB B0 rB B in B D K in terms of recip rocal ratios of known magnitudes of amplitudes 60 rB B0 D K 0 rB B D K s B D 0K B0 D 0K 0 . This follows from an approximation, A B0 D 0K 0 A B D 0K , where the B0 and B processes are related to each other by replacing a spectator d quark by a u quark. While formally Eq. is not an isospin prediction, it may be obtained using an isospin triangle relation,61 A B0 D 0K 0 A B D 0K A B D K 0 , and neglecting the second amplitude on the right hand side which is pure annihilation .62 This amplitude is expected to be suppressed by a factor of four or

Further information on these quantities may be obtained by applying isospin sym metry to all B decays. In order to carry out an isospin analysis,33 one uses the fact that the three physical B decay amplitudes and the three B decay amplitudes, January 4, 2014 0 41 WSPC INSTRUCTION FILE CP review 10 M. Gronau depending each on two isospin amplitudes, obey triangle relations of the form, A B0 2 A B0 0 0 A B 0 0 . Furthermore, the penguin amplitude is pure hence the , A B 0 e2i A B 0 . Defin ing sin 2 eff S 1 C2 1 2, the difference eff is then determined by an angle between corresponding sides of the two isospin triangles sharing a com mon base, A B 0 A B 0 . A sign ambiguity in eff is resolved by two model independent features which are confirmed experimentally, P T 1, 2. This implies eff.78 Table I. Branching ratios and CP asymmetries in B , B .

An impressive experimentally progress has been achieved in the past two years in extracting a precise value for eff, 110.6 3.6 3.2 . However, the er ror on eff using the isospin triangles is still large. An upper bound, given by CP averaged rates and a direct CP asymmetry in B0 ,79,80 cos 2 eff 1 2 0 00 2 0 0 q 1 C2 , leads to eff 31 at 1 . Adding in quadrature the error in effand the uncertainty in eff, this implies 95 16 or 64 16 by . A similar central value but a smaller error, 97 11 , has been reported recently by the Belle Collaboration.81 The possibility that a penguin amplitude in B0 may lead to a large CP asymmetry S for values of near 90 where sin 2 0 was anticipated fifteen years ago.82 The bound on eff may be improved considerably by measuring a nonzero direct CP asymmetry in B0 0 0. This asymmetry can be shown to be large and positive see Eq. in Sec. 5.2 , implying a large rate for B0 but a small rate for B0. Namely, the triangle is expected to be squashed, while the B triangle is roughly equal sided. An alternative way of treating the penguin amplitude in B0 is by combining within flavor SU the decay rate and asymmetries in this process with January 4, 2014 0 41 WSPC INSTRUCTION FILE CP review CP violation in beauty decays 11 rates and asymmetries in B0 K0 or B0 0,101 where the K in B0 K0 is light (u, d, or s) quarks. This approach has been applied to B0 and B0 0 decay modes, using both global and event shape variables, obtaining the CP violation parameter 17 , which is a linear combination of angles and sides of isospin triangles relating B0 , B0 , and B0 K decay modes.234 ,14 The central value of Re is positive, but the error is large enough so that .

Chunk: to vary by 0.22 around one. A current update of this rather conservative analysis obtains 83 73 4 10 8 , where the first error is experimental, while the second one is due to an uncertainty in SU breaking. A discussion of SU breaking factors relating B0 and B0 K is included in Section 5.2. 4.2. B Angular analyses of the pions in decays have shown that B0 is dominated almost 100 by longitudinal polarization 20. This simplifies the isospin analysis of CP asymmetries in these decays to becoming similar to B0 . The advantage of B over B is the relative small value of 0 0 in comparison with and 0 see Table I , indicating a smaller P T in B P T 0.3 8 than in B0 P T 0.5 77 . Eq. leads to an upper bound on eff in B , eff 17 at 1 . The asymmetries for longitudinal s given in Table I imply 91.7 5.3 5.2 . Thus, one finds 83 10 or 76 10 by adding errors in quadrature. A stronger bound on P T in B0 , leading to a more precise value of , may be obtained by relating this process to B K 0 within flavor SU . 84 One uses the branching ratio and fraction of longitudinal rate measured for this process 20, K 0 9.2 1.5 10 6, fL K 0 0.48 0.08, to normalize the penguin amplitude in B0 . Including a conservative uncertainty from SU breaking and smaller amplitudes, one finds a value 71.4 5.8 8.8 4.7 1.7 , where the first error is experimental and the second one theoretical. The current small theoretical error in requires including isospin breaking effects in studies based on isospin symmetry.

Chunk: K0 0 0.97 0.07 . The largest deviation from one, observed in the ratio R at 2 , is insufficient for claiming unambiguous evidence for a non penguin contribution. An upper limit, .965 at 90 confidence level, would imply 79 using sin2 R,88 which neglects however color suppressed EWP contributions.89 As we will argue now, these contributions and color suppressed tree amplitudes are actually not suppressed as naively expected.

Such an interference occurs also in B K 0 where no asymmetry has been observed. An assumption that other contributions to the lat ter asymmetry are negligible has raised some questions about the validity of the CKM framework. In fact, a color suppressed tree amplitude C , also occurring in B K 0,86 resolves this puzzle if this amplitude is comparable in magnitude to T . Indeed, several studies have shown that this is the case,90,91,92,93,94 also im plying that color suppressed and color favored EWP amplitudes are of comparable magnitudes.35 For consistency between the two CP asymmetries in B0 K and B K 0, the strong phase difference between C and T must be negative and cannot be very small.95 This seems to stand in contrast to QCD calculations using a factorization theorem.29,31,94 The small asymmetry ACP B K 0 implies bounds on the sine of the strong phase difference c between T C and P . The cosine of this phase affects Rc 1 involving the decay rates for B K0 and B K0 .

Chunk: is Universal Effect . One calls a force Differetial if it acts differently on different substances. It is called Universal if it is quantitatively the same for all the substances . If we heat a rod of initial length l0 from initial temperature T0 to tempetature T then its length is given as 1 T T0 where the coefficient for thermal expansion is different for different materials. Hence this is a Differential Force. Now the correction factor due to the influence of gravitation on the length of the rod is 1 C m r cos2 Here the rod is placed at a distance r from sun whose mass is m and is the angle of the rod with respect to the the line sun to rod. C is a universal constant in CGS unit .7 x 10 29 . As this acts in the same manner for any material of mass m, gravity is a Universal Force as per the above definition. Reichenbach also gives a general definition of the Universal Forces 3,p 12 as affecting all the materials in the same manner and there are no insulating walls against it. We saw above that gravity is such a force, Indeed gravity is a Universal Force par excellance. It affects all matter in the same manner. The equality of the gravitational and inertial masses is what ensures this physically. If the gravitational and inertial masses were not found to be equal, then one would not have been able to visualize of the paths of freely falling mass points as geodesics in the four dimentional space time. In that case different geodesics would have resulted from different materials of mass points . Therefore the universal effect of gravitation on different kinds of measur ing instruments is to define a single geometry for all of them. Viewed this way, one may say that gravity is geometerized. It is not theory of gravitation that becomes geometry, but it is geometry that becomes the experience of the 3 gravitational field 3, p 256 . Why does the planet follow the curved path? Not because it is acted upon by a force but because the curved space time manifold leaves it with no other choice! So as per Einstein s theory of relativity, one does not speak of a change produced by the gravitational field in the measuring instruments, but regard the measuring instruments as free from any deforming forces. Gravity being a Universal Force, in the Einstein s Theory of Relativity, it basically disappears and is replaced by geometry. In fact Reichenbach 3, p 22 shows how one can give a consistent defi nition of a rigid rod the same rigid rods which are needed in relativity to measure all lengths. Rigid rods are solid bodies which are not affected by Differential Forces, or concerning which the influence of Differential Forces has been eliminated by corrections Universal Forces are disregarded. We do not neglect Universal Forces. We set them to zero by definition. Without such a rule a rigid body cannot be defined. In fact this rule also helps in defining a closed system as well. All this was formalized in terms of a theorem by Reichenbach 3, p 33 THEOREM Given the geometry G0 to which the measuring instruments conform, we can imagine a Universal Force F which affects the instruments in such a way that the actual geometry is an arbitrary geometry G, while the ob served deviation from G is due to universal deformation of the measuring instruments. G0 . As per Reichenbach s prin ciple one prefers the theory wherein we put . If we accept Reichenbach principle of putting the Universal Force of gravity to zero, then the arbitrari ness in the choice of the measuring procedure is avoided and the question of the geometrical structure of the physical space has a unique answer deter mined by physical measurement.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0078v1 gr qc 1 Apr 2007 Linear perturbations of matched spacetimes the gauge problem and background symmetries Marc Mars , Filipe C. Mena and Ra ul Vera Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Salamanca, Plaza de la Merced s n, 37008 Salamanca, Spain Departamento de Matem atica, Universidade do Minho, Campus de Gualtar, 4710 Braga, Portugal Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, 24 29 St Giles , Oxford OX1 3LB, UK Fisika Teorikoaren Saila, Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, Apt. 644, Bilbao 48080, Basque Country, Spain June 18, 2013 Abstract We present a critical review about the study of linear perturbations of matched spacetimes including gauge problems. We analyse the freedom introduced in the perturbed matching by the presence of background symmetries and revisit the par ticular case of spherically symmetry in n dimensions. This analysis includes settings with boundary layers such as brane world models and shell cosmologies. PACS numbers 0420, 0240 1 Introduction An important aspect in any geometric gravitational theory is the analysis of how to match two spacetimes. This is true in particular for General Relativity and its perturbation theory. Despite the relevance and maturity of the matching theory one often finds papers where the matching conditions are not properly used. Most of the difficulties arise from the fact that the matching conditions are imposed in specific coordinate systems in a manner which is not completely coordinate independent. More specifically, matching two spacetimes requires identifying the boundaries pointwise, and sometimes this identification is done implicitly by fixing spacetime coordinates, without paying enough attention to the fact that solving the matching involves finding an identification of the boundary and that this should not be fixed a priori. In perturbation theory this problem also arises, and it gets complicated by the fact that the fields to be matched as the perturbed metric are gauge dependent. So, in addition to a priori choices of identifications of the boundary, there is also the problem 1 that particular gauges are often used. It may be argued that the matching theory must be gauge independent and therefore it can be performed in any gauge. This is true, but only when due care is taken to ensure that the choice of gauge does not restrict, a priori, the perturbed identification of the boundaries. A complete description of the linearized matching conditions has been achieved only recently by Carter and Battye and independently by Mukohyama . To second order, the matching conditions have been recently found in . Despite these papers, we believe that some confusion still lingers in the field, in particular with respect to the existing gauge invariant formulations. The aim of this paper is to try to clarify these issues. In order to do that, we will critically discuss some of the approaches proposed in the literature trying to make clear which are the implicit assumptions made and to what extent are they justified. The first papers discussing the perturbed matching theory are, as far as we know, the classic papers by Gerlach and Sengupta . However, as explained below, their description of the perturbed matching theory contains imprecisions, and we will therefore start discussing their approach pointing out the difficulties they encounter. A first attempt to justify the claims in is due to Mart n Garc a and Gundlach , who propose a different but nevertheless closely related set of linearized matching conditions. Pointing out the implicit assumption made by these authors will also help us to try to explain the subtleties inherent to the perturbed matching theory. In the linearized matching conditions are described for arbitrary backgrounds, perturbations and matching hypersurfaces, and then applied to the case of two background spacetimes with a high degree of symmetry, namely those which admit a maximal group of isometries acting on codimension two spacelike submanifolds e.g. spherically symmetric spacetimes . In order to simplify the matching conditions, Mukohyama derives a set of matching conditions for

Chunk: so called doubly gauge invariants. However, a gap arises in his final conclusions as the presented set of conditions for doubly gauge invariant quantities for the linearized matching of spacetimes are only shown to be necessary conditions. Analysing sufficiency touches directly on the issue we are trying to emphasize in this paper, so we devote one section to clarify this point, where we show how these conditions are, stricktly speaking, not sufficient. Since the matching conditions in terms of doubly gauge invariants are widely used in the literature, we consider important to close this gap. Moreover, the constructions of gauge invariant quantities using spherical harmonic decompositons leaves out the 1 sectors. We will discuss this issue and its consequences. The paper is organized as follows. We start by summarising the perturbed matching conditions in Section 2, where we also describe the gauge freedom involved. Then, the procedures used in the classic papers together with the justifications and further developments in are reviewed in Section 3. Section 4 focuses on the consequences of the existence of symmetries in the background configuration, which will have relevance in our final discussion. Section 5 has three subsections. The first one is devoted to present briefly the procedure and results discussed in particularised to the case of spherically symmetric backgrounds. In the second subsection we analyse the sufficiency of the doubly gauge invariant matching conditions in . The last subsection is devoted to the study of the freedom left in the perturbation of the matching hypersurface once the metric perturbations have been fixed at both sides. We finish with an appendix where explicit expressions for the discontinuities of the perturbed second fundamental forms in 2 the spherical case are given. Some of these expressions are used in the main text. 2 Linearized matching In this section we describe the gauge freedom involved in the linearised spacetime matching and summarise the perturbed matching conditions. 2.1 Gauge freedom The purpose of the matching theory is to construct a new spacetime out of two spacetimes M with boundary by finding a suitable diffeomorphism between the boundaries which allows for their pointwise identification. In particular, the matched spacetime cannot be thought to exist beforehand. Another aspect to bear in mind is that the matching conditions involve exclusively tensors on the identified boundary and hence any coordi nate system in M is equally valid. This is well known but it is still source of confusion sometimes. In perturbed matching theory, not only the metrics are perturbed but also the match ing hypersurfaces may be deformed. Furthermore, as for the metric, the deviation of the matching hypersurface is also a gauge dependent quantity. This can be best understood by viewing perturbations as derivatives at 0 of a one parameter family of space times M , g with boundary . It is convenient to embed M within a larger manifold without boundary V to clarify the discussion. A priori, the manifolds M , g are completely distinct so it makes no direct sense to talk about derivatives. It is necessary to identify first the different manifolds so that a single point p refers to one point on each of the manifolds. Obviously, there are infinite ways to identify the manifolds, all of them equally valid a priori. This freedom leads to the gauge dependence of the perturbed met ric and of any other geometrically defined tensor . The identification above may, or may not, map the boundaries among themselves. A priori, a point in 0 may be mapped, for 0, to a point on , to a point interior to M or to a point exterior to M within the extension V which is not part of the manifold. How can we then take derivatives with respect to at those later points? Since only derivatives at 0 are needed, re stricting to infinitesimal values of entails no loss of generality. Then, if

Chunk: condi tions need to be intrinsic to the matching hypersurfaces. However, Gerlach and Sengupta themselves note that conditions are not gauge2 invariant. Since the main interest in refers to spherically symmetric backgrounds, this ambiguity is fixed in that case by finding suitable gauge invariant combinations of the linearized matching conditions, which turn out to give a correct set of necessary perturbed matching conditions in spherical symmetry. It should be stressed however, that the authors consider these gauge invariant subset to be sufficient also, with no further justification. We know from the discussion in Sect. 2.1 above that cannot be correct as it leads to a set of gauge dependent conditions. Since, on the other hand the proposal may look plausible, it is of interest to point out where, and in which sense, it fails to be correct. The first source of problems comes from assuming that the matched spacetime is given beforehand. Indeed, q and K are spacetime tensors and they can only exist and be continuous once the matched spacetime is constructed. But this is precisely the purpose of the matching conditions, so the conditions become circular. Another aspect of the same problem is that one can only talk about continuity once the pointwise identification of the boundaries is chosen. But a level set of a function defines only a set of points and not the way those points must be identified. A third instance of the same issue is that tensor components must be expressed in some basis, e.g. a common coordinate system covering both sides of . But again this cannot be assumed a priori. It needs to be constructed. Let us however mention that once the pointwise identification of the boundaries is chosen, the use of spacetime tensors is allowed provided they are finally projected onto the hypersurface. In that sense, and when properly used, using spacetime indices may simplify some calculations notably see Carter and Battye, where this notation is used to derive the perturbed matching conditions . Besides this aspect which already affects the background matching the perturbed equations suffer from one extra problem. The perturbations q p and K p at a point p in the background can be defined by taking derivatives at fixed p and 0 of the corresponding tensors defined by g and f . For each value of , the matching conditions impose the continuity of q and K everywhere with the caveat already mentioned regarding the identification of the boundaries . However, continuity of q and K at p would only follow if derivatives of continuous functions with respect to an external parameter were necessarily continuous in our case, the derivative with respect to , which is not true in general. A trivial example is given by the function u , x x , whith x R. For each this function is continuous. However, the derivative with respect to does not even exist at , 0. This reflects the fact that subtracting continuous tensors at a fixed spacetime point p leads to objects that need not be continuous. This is in fact the main problem of as linearized matching conditions. An immediate question arises Why is the gauge invariant subset of matching condi tions found in for spherically symmetric backgrounds correct? In order to understand this, let us rewrite using the formalism of section 2.2. First of all, since n n will contain, at least, one free n , we have q q q q q g . 2Throughout this section gauge will refer to spacetime gauge. Hypersurface gauges will only appear briefly towards the end of the section. 6 Moreover, a simple calculation gives n n S n and q g n n g n n n n . These, together with standard properties of the projector, lead to q q K a q n q q n q q S n , where a n n

However, when the gauges are chosen so that Z 0, then f 0 on because the matching hypersurface is unperturbed as seen from the background. Consequently f n on , which implies n hn for some function h. Imposing n to be unit for all fixes 2g n n . Inserting into the matching conditions become q q g q q g , o 2g n n K q q S n o 2g n n K q q S n , which agree with with the exception that refers to spacetime tensors and are defined on . Since Gerlach and Sengupta derive a subset of gauge invariant matching conditions out of in the spherically symmetric case and their conditions are correct in one gauge, it follows that the invariant subset is correct in any gauge. This is the reason why the results in involving spherically symmetric backgrounds turn out to be fine. Substantial progress in the linearized matching problem was made by Mart n Garc a and Gundlach . These authors pointed out the lack of justification in for the choice of as matching conditions. It was also argued that for spacetimes with boundary it only makes sense to define perturbations by using gauges where the perturbed matching hypersurface is mapped onto the background matching hypersurface. Perturbations in this gauge, called surface gauge not to be confused with hypersurface gauge are denoted by , and its defining property is . The idea was to write down the matching conditions in this gauge and then transform into any other gauge if necessary. As noticed by the authors, the surface gauge is not unique since there are still three degrees of freedom left, which correspond to the three directions tangent to . A relevant observation made in was that the continuity of tensorial perturbations may depend on the index position in the tensors. The authors argue that the tensors truly intrinsic to the hypersurfaces are q , K with indices upstairs and propose the following perturbed matching conditions q q , K K , which are demonstrated to become exactly . This shows the equivalence of both pro posals in the surface gauge, as explicitly stated in . This justifies partially the validity of both approaches in the surface gauge. However, the justification is not complete because of the issue we discuss next. Indeed, conditions still carry one implicit assumption that needs to be clarified. As already stressed the perturbed matching conditions have two inherent and independent degrees of gauge freedom. The approach by Mart n Garc a and Gundlach involves only spacetime objects, and therefore can only notice the spacetime gauge freedom. This leads 7 to an incorrect statement in , as it is not true that the linearized matching conditions read in any surface gauge. Conditions will only be valid when the spacetime gauge maps pairs of background points identified, via the background matching to pairs of points on the perturbed boundaries which are also identified through the matching. Notice that not all surface gauges have this property. In explicit terms, this means that the vectors Z must i only have tangential components so that we are in surface gauge and ii have the same components when written in terms of an intrinsic basis of 0. In less precise, but more intuitive terms, condition ii states that Z and Z are the same vector, i.e. that the gauges in both regions are chosen such that the displacement of one fixed point of the background hypersurface is identical in both regions the displaced point, of course, stays on the unperturbed hypersurface, due to the choice of surface gauge . Observe finally that if Q 0 and T T , then the linearized matching conditions truly reduce to conditions , once the latter are projected on . This shows the

Chunk: related to not solving for superfluous information. In fact, a set of equations where also Q and Q have disappeared would be even more convenient from this point of view, provided one is not interested in knowing how the hypersurfaces are deformed in the specific spacetime gauge being used. Since the use of doubly gauge invariant matching conditions is used extensively, let us recall its main ingredients in order to discuss if they really are equivalent to the full set of linearized matching equations and in which sense. To that aim Mukohyama , decomposes the perturbation tensors q ij and K ij in terms of scalar Y , vector VA and tensor harmonics TAB on the sphere, as3 q ijd id 0 00Y d 2 Y T Y ABd Ad B X T 0V T A L 0V L A d d A X T T T AB LT T LT AB LL T LL AB d Ad B, K ijd id 0 00Y d 2 Y T Y ABd Ad B X T 0V T A L 0V L A d d A X T T T AB LT T LT AB LL T LL AB d Ad B, where all the scalar coefficients depend only on . Each coefficient in the decomposition has indices l and m which have been dropped for notational simplicity.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0079v1 math.OA 2 Apr 2007 Operator Algebras Associated with Unitary Commutation Relations Stephen C. Power Lancaster University Department of Mathematics and Statistics Lancaster, United Kingdom LA1 4YF E mail s.power lancaster.ac.uk Baruch Solel Technion Department of Mathematics Haifa 32000, Israel E mail mabaruch techunix.technion.ac.il June 15, 2013 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 47L55, 47L30, 47L75, 46L05. SCP is supported by EPSRC grant EP E002625 1 BS is supported by the Fund for the Promotion of Research at the Technion and by EPSRC grant EP E002625 1 1 Abstract We define nonselfadjoint operator algebras with generators Le1, . . . , Len, Lf1, . . . , Lfm subject to the unitary commutation rela tions of the form ,l ui,j,k,lLflLek where ui,j,k,l is an nm nm unitary matrix. These algebras, which generalise the analytic Toeplitz algebras of rank 2 graphs with a single vertex, are classified up to isometric isomorphism in terms of the matrix u. 1 Introduction The unilateral shift on complex separable Hilbert space generates two funda mental operator algebras, namely the norm closed unital algebra and the weak operator topology closed algebra. The former is naturally isomorphic to the disc algebra of holomorphic functions on the unit disc, continuous to the boundary, while the latter is isomorphic to H . The freely noncommuting multivariable generalisations of these algebras arise from the freely noncom muting shifts Le1, . . . , Len given by the left creation operators on the Fock space 0 Cn k. Here the generated operator algebras, denoted An and Ln for the norm and weak topologies, are known as the noncommu tative disc algebra and the freesemigroup algebra. They have been studied extensively with respect to operator algebra structure, representation theory and the multivariable operator theory of row contractions. See for example , . Higher rank generalisations of these algebras arise when one considers several families of freely noncommuting generators between which there are commutation relations. In the present paper we consider a very general form of such relations, namely ,l ui,j,k,lLflLek where Le1, . . ., Len and Lf1, . . . , Lfm are freely noncommuting and ui,j,k,l is an nm nm unitary matrix. The associated operator algebras are denoted Au and Lu and we classify them up to various forms of isomorphism in terms 2 of the unitary matrices u. Such unitary relations arose originally in the con text of the general dilation theorem proven in Solel , for two row contractions T1 Tn and S1 Sm satisfying the unitary commutation relations. For 1, we have with 1 and Au is the subalgebra of the rotation C algebra for the relations vu. When u is a permutation unitary matrix arising from a permutation in Snm then the relations are those associated with a single vertex rank 2 graph in the sense of Kumjian and Pask, and the algebras in this case have been considered in Kribs and Power and Power . In particular, in it was shown that there are 9 operator algebras A arising from the 24 permutations in case 2. In contrast, we see below in Section 6 that for general 2 by 2 unitaries u there are uncountably many isomorphism classes of the unitary relation algebras Au expressed in terms of a nine fold real parametrisation of isomorphism types. The algebras A are easily defined they are determined by the left regular representation of the semigroup F whose generators are e1, . . ., en, f1, . . . , fm subject to the relations i, j k, l . On the other hand the unitary relation algebras Au are generated by creation operators on a Z2 graded Fock space P k,l C2, with inner product given by the grading operator 3

Chunk: X the operators 1 ei and 1 fj , we see that is analytic. The same arguments apply to 1. The facts in the following proposition obtained in in the case of permutation matrices. Proposition 5.8 Let Au Av be an algebraic isomorphism and let u v be the associated map between the character spaces. Suppose 0, 0 0, 0 . Then we have the following. and we shall assume that and interchanging E and F and changing u to u if necessary . There are unitary matrices U n n and V m m such that z, w Uz, V w for z, w u. If z, w V w, Uz . If is an isometric isomorphism, then is a bigraded isomorphism. Or, if , it may be a graded exchange isomorphism . Proof. The proof of Proposition 6.3 in giving and in the permutation case is based essentially on Schwarz s lemma for holomorphic map from the unit disc. It applies without change to the case of unitary matrices. 25 For we may assume and . From we have for each Lei LUei X where X is a sum of higher order terms. Since Lei is a contraction and LUei is an isometry it follows, as in the proof of Voiculescu s theorem, that . Similarly, Lfj LV fj and it follows that is bigraded. Since every graded isomorphism satisfies 0, 0 0, 0 , we conclude the following. Corollary 5.9 Every graded isometric isomorphism is bigraded if n m and otherwise is either bigraded or is a graded exchange isomorphism. Theorem 5.10 The following statements are equivalent for unitary matrices u, v in Mn C Mm C . i There is an isometric isomorphism Au Av. ii There is a graded isometric isomorphism from Au Av. iii The matrices u, v are product unitary equivalent or in case the matrices u, v are product unitary equivalent, where v i,j , k,l v l,k , j,i . iv There is an isometric w continuous isomorphism Lu Lv. Proof. Given in i , let z, w 0, 0 . By Proposition 5.6 z, w lies in the interior of 0 v. By Theorem 4.8 there is a completely isometric automor phism of Av such that 0, 0 z, w and, therefore, 1 0, 0 0, 0 . By Proposition 5.8, 1 is a graded isometric isomorphism and ii holds. Lemma 5.2 shows that ii implies iii and Lemma 5.5 that iii implies i . Finally, iii implies iv follows from Lemma 5.5, and iv implies ii is entirely similar to i implies ii . Remark 5.11 The argument at the beginning of the proof of Theorem 5.10 shows that, whenever Au and Av are isomorphic, we . Theorem 5.12 For n m the isometric automorphisms of Au are of the form A,B z,w where z, w 0 u and A B A B . In case , in addition, those of the form A,B z,w where A B A B . 26 6 Special cases 6.1 The case 2 Even in the low dimensions 2 there are many isomorphism classes and special cases. Note that the product unitary equivalence class orbit O u of the 4 4 unitary matrix u takes the form O u , and so the product unitary equivalence classes are parametrised by the set of orbits, U4 C Ad SU2 C SU2 C . This set admits a 10 fold parametrisa tion, since, as is easily checked, U4 C and SU2 C SU2 C are real algebraic varieties of dimension 16 and 6 respectively. It follows that the isometric iso morphism types of the algebras Au admit a 10 fold real parametrisation, with coincidences only for pairs O u , O v with v We now look at some special cases in more detail. Let u I . Case I z, w B2 B2, we

Chunk: have z, w u if and only if the vector z1w1, z1w2, z2w1, z2w2 t lies in Ker u I . Thus, in case I, u is as small as possible and is equal to min B2 B2 . It follows from Lemma 3.4 that, in this case, 0 . By Proposition 5.8 every isometric automorphism of Au is graded and the isometric automorphisms of Au are given by pairs A, B of unitary matrices such that A B either commutes with u or intertwines u and u. Case II 1 it still follows from Lemma 3.4 that 0 u to be larger than min. In fact, if the non zero vector a, b, c, d t spanning Ker u I satisfies ad bc then min but 27 if a b c d is of rank one and can be written as z1, z2 t w1, w2 . Thus, z, w Vu and u contains some z, w with non zero z and w. Since 0 , it is still true that isometric isomorphisms and auto morphisms of these algebras are graded. Case III 2 it is possible that 0 u will contain non zero vectors z, w but, as Lemma 3.4 shows, it does not contain a vector with both z 0 and w 0. All other possibilities may occur. For example write u1, u2 and u3 for the three diagonal matrices 1, 1, 1, 1 , 1, 1, 1, 1 and 1, 1, 1, 1 . Using the definition of the core, we easily see that 0 , 0 0 . Thus, the only isometric automorphisms of Au1 are graded, the isomet ric automorphisms of Au2 are formed by composing graded automorphisms with automorphisms of the type described in Proposition 4.7 with 0, 0 and w1, 0 . Similarly, for the automorphisms of Au3, we use Proposi tion 4.6. Case IV . Every 4 4 unitary matrix u with dim Ker u I 3 is determined by a unit eigenvector x and its different from 1 eigenvalue. So that x, , 1 and 1. Suppose u and v are product unitary equivalent that is A B A B for unitary matrices A, B, and write x, for the unit eigenvector and eigen value of u. Of course, x is determined only up to a multiple by a scalar 28 of absolute value 1 . Then A B x is a unit eigenvector of v with eigenvalue . For unit vectors x, y in C4 we write x y if there are unitary 2 2 matrices A, B with A B x. For the statement of the next lemma recall that the entries of the vectors x and y in C4 are indexed by . Lemma 6.1 For a vector , write c x for the 2 2 matrix c x x 1,1 x 1,2 x 2,1 x 2,2 . Then x y if and only if there are unitary matrices A, B such that c x Ac y B. In this case, we shall write c x c y . Proof. Suppose A B x for some unitary matrices ai,j and bi,j . Then c y i, i,j P A B i,j , k,l x k,l P k,l ai,kbj,lc x k, Ac x B i,j. Using the polar decomposition c x U c x and diagonalizing c x V a 0 0 d V , we find that c x a 0 0 d c y where a, 0, 0, d and a, d 0. Then a, d the eigenvalues of c x are uniquely determined once we choose them such that a d and, if , then a2 so that 0 a 1 2 and a determines d . In this way, we associate to each unitary matrix u as above a pair a, with 0 a 1 2, 1 and 1. Using Lemma 6.1 and the

Chunk: ranges. Thus it defines a representation k of En on F k H with k Lei w kLeiwk . Note that we are using Lei for the creation operators both on H and on F E, F, u . This should cause no confusion . We also write for the representation P k k of En on F F H where 0 is the representation of En on H . Let X be the column space Cm En . This is a C module over En. As a vector space it is the direct sum of m copies of En. The right module action of En on X is given by ai aib and the En valued inner product . For every 1 i n, we write Si for the operator in L X defined by Si aj m X j,k u i,j , k,l Lekaj m . 33 Note that X j,k u i,j , k,l Lekaj m , X j ,k u i,j , k ,l Lek bj m X j,j ,k,k ,l u i,j , k,l a jL ekLek bj u i,j , k ,l X j,j uu i,j , i,j a jbj X j a . Thus Si is an isometry. A similar computation shows that these isometries have orthogonal ranges and, thus, this family defines a homomorphism En L X , with Lei Si, 1 i n, making X a C correspondence over En in the sense of and . Once we have a correspondence we can form X X and, more generally, X k. Recall that to define X X one defines the sesquilinear y on the algebraic tensor product and then lets X X be the Hausdorffcompletion. The right action of En on X X is x y y a and the left action is given by the map 2. 2 a x y a x y. The definition of X k is similar and the left action map is denoted k For En and 0 is defined by left multiplication . Also write for P k k, the left action of En on F X . One can then define the Hilbert space X k EnH by defining the sesquilin ear x, y X k and applying the Hausdorff completion. Now define the map v X En H F H by setting v ai h X i fi aih. It is straightforward to check that this map is a well defined Hilbert space isomorphism. By induction, we also define maps vk X k En H F k H by vk 1 aj z X j fj vk k aj IH z 34 for z X k En H and v0 is the identity map from En En H which is isomorphic to H and F 0 . Assume that vk is a Hilbert space isomorphism of X k En H onto F k H and compute, for aj , bj X and z, z X k H, X j,j X z, k a jbj IH z . Thus, by induction, each map vk is a Hilbert space isomorphism and, sum ming up, we get a Hilbert space isomorphism v X k vk F X En H F F H. Lemma 7.1 v is a Hilbert space isomorphism and intertwines the actions of En. That is, v a IH a v for a En. Proof. We show that, for every p 0 and a En, we have vp p a IH p a vp. The proof will proceed by induction on p. For . For 1 i n, aj X and z X p H, we have vp 1 p 1 Lei IH aj z vp 1 Lei aj z P l,k,j u i,j , k,l fl vp p Lekaj IH z . Using the induction hypothesis, this is equal to X l,k,j u i,j , k,l fl p Lek p aj ,k,j

This proves for p 1 and the generators of En. Since both p 1 and vp 1 p 1 IH v p 1 are homomorphisms, holds for p 1 and every a En, completing the induction step. Thus, holds for every p and this implies the statement of the lemma. Write l for the vector aj in X such that 0 if l j. The tensor algebra T X is generated by the operators T l where T l is the creation operator on F X associated with l and the C algebra En . The latter algebra is generated as a C algebra by the operators Li where is the set of generators of En. We have Lemma 7.2 For every 1 i n and 1 j m and k 0, i w vk Li IH Lei w vk. ii w vk 1 T j IH Lfj w vk. Proof. Part i follows from and part ii from with j in place of aj . Recalling that w v is a unitary operator mapping F X H onto F E, F, u , we get Theorem 7.3 The algebra Au is unitarily isomorphic to the norm closed subalgebra of the tensor algebra T X that is generated by . The norm closed subalgebra of B F E, F, u that is generated by Lei, L ei, Lfj 1 i n, 1 j m is unitarily isomorphic to the tensor algebra T X and contains Au . The norm closed subalgebra of B F E, F, u that is generated by Lei, L fj, Lfj 1 i n, 1 j m is unitarily isomorphic to a tensor algebra T Y and contains Au . 36 Proof. Parts and follow from Lemma 7.2. For part , note that one can interchange the roles of E and F. More precisely, one defines the C module Y over Em to be Em and the left action of Em on Y by Y Lfl bk n P j,k u i,j , k,l Lfjbk n . This makes Y into a C correspondence over Em and the rest of the proof proceeds along similar lines as above. Suppose . Then X is the correspondence associated with the automorphism of En given by mapping Ti to Pn ,jTj note that u, in this case, is an n n matrix . The tensor algebra T X is the analytic crossed product En Z and Au is unitarily isomorphic to the subalgebra of this analytic crossed product that can be written An Z . One can also embed Au in T Y as in Corollary 7.3 . Here Em is simply the classical Toeplitz algebra T and T with Y Tz bk P k ui,kTzbk i where Tz is the generator of T . Remark 7.4 Since the automorphisms z,w and A,B of Au are both uni tarily implemented, they can be extended to T X . It is easy to check that they map T X into itself and, thus, are automorphisms of T X . Hence, at least when n m, every automorphism of Au can be extended to an auto morphism of the tensor algebra T X that contains it see Theorem 5.12 .

Thus z, w u. For the other direction, fix first z, w u with 1. It follows from the definition of u and from that z, w defines a linear and multiplicative map on the algebra C F u such that Lei is mapped into zi and Lfj wj. Abusing notation slightly, we write x for Lx for every x E k F l. Also, for i1, . . . , ik and j1, . . . , jl , we write eifj for ei1 eik fj1 fjl. These elements form an orthonormal basis for E k F l and we now set w X i,j X k,l eifj eifj F X . If pi 0 and p1 . . . ! p1! pn! terms ei1 eik with ei1 eik zp1 1 zp2 2 zpk k .

Thus w , L ew e w e P eifj e w 2. Similarly, w , L fw f w f P eifj f w 2 for f F. Thus if we write w w then x for every x E k F l for every k, l . This shows that is contractive and is w continuous. We can, therefore, extend it to an element of M Lu , also denoted . The analysis above shows that the image of the map 7 z, w u defined above on M Au contains Vu Bn Bm . Since M Au is compact and the map is w continuous, its image contains and, thus, is equal to u. This completes the proof of . To complete the proof of , we need to show that, if z, w u and the corresponding character extends to a w continuous character on Lu, then 1. For this, write L for the w closed subalgebra of Lu generated by Le e E . Let P be the projection of F E, F, u onto F E C E E E . Then PTP, is a w continuous isomorphism of L onto PLuP. The latter algebra is unitarily equivalent to the algebra Ln studied in . A w continuous character of Lu gives rise, therefore, to a w continuous character on Ln. It follows from 2, Theorem 2.3 that z Bn. Similarly, one shows that w Bm. To state the next result, we first write u i,j for the n m matrix whose k, l entry is u i,j , k,l . Thus, the i, j row of u provides the n rows of u i,j . We then compute X k,l u i,j , k,l X l u i,j , k,l wl u i,j w . Write Ei,j for the n m matrix whose i, j entry is 1 and all other entries are 0 so and write C i,j for the matrix u i,j Ei,j. Then the computation above yields the following. Lemma 3.2 With C i,j defined as above, we have z, w Cn Cm 0, for all i, j . 8 Definition 3.3 The core of u is the subset given by 0 u z, w Bn Bm C i,j , Ct i,j , j . Fix z, w 0 u. We have u i,j ,jw for all i, j. Thus, for every k, X l u i,j , k,l i,kwj where i,k is 1 if

Chunk: and, for a1, a2, . . . , an, in C we have P k,l u i,j , k,l . Hence, if we let w i be the vector in Cmn defined by w i k,l k,iwl, we get u w i w i . Similarly, for z, we have X k u i,j , k,l j,lzi and for scalars b1, . . . , bm we have P k,l u i,j , k,l . Thus, writing z j for the vector defined by z j k,l l,jzk, we have u z j z j . The vector w i in i w where is the standard basis of Cn, and, similarly, z j z j. We therefore obtain Lemma 3.4 which will be useful in Section 6. We note also the following companion formula. Suppose z, w 0 u. Then, as we noted above, u z j z j and, thus, u z j z j . Writing this explicitly, we have, for all i, j, l, X k u k,l , i,j j,l zi. . Lemma 3.4 Let z, w be a vector in the core 0 u. Then span z j , w i 1 i n, 1 j m Ker u I . In particular, i If the core contains a vector z, w with z 0, then dim Ker u I m. ii If the core contains a vector z, w with w 0 then dim Ker u I n. 9 iii If the core contains a vector z, w with z 0 and w 0, then dim Ker u I m n 1. We now characterise the core in an algebraic manner in terms of repre sentations into the algebra T2 of upper triangular 2 2 matrices. We remark that nest representations such as these have proven useful in the algebraic structure theory of nonself adjoint algebra ? , . Let C F u T2 with T 1,1 T 1,2 T 0 2,1 T Then 1,1 and 2,2 are characters and 1,2 is a linear functional that satisfies 1,2 TS 1,1 T 1,2 S 1,2 T 2,2 S for T, S C F u . We now restrict to the case where 1, 2,2. By Proposition 3.1 , both are associated with a point z, w in Vu. It follows from that 1,2 is determined by its values on Lei and Lfj. Setting 1,2 Lei and 1,2 Lfj , we associate with each homomorphism as discussed above a quadruple z, w, , where z, w Vu and, for every i, j, zi j ,l u i,j , k,l wl k lzk . The last equation follows from . Using we can write the last equation as zi j . That is, , Ct i,j z 0. The following lemma now follows from the definition of the core. Lemma 3.5 A point z, w u lies in the core 0 u if and only if every , Cn Cm defines a homomorphism C F u T2 such that Lei zi i 0 zi and Lfj wj j 0 wj for all i, j. 10 4 Automorphisms of Ln and Lu We first derive the unitary automorphisms of Ln and An associated with U 1, n . These were obtained by Voiculescu in the setting of the Cuntz Toeplitz algebra. However the automorphisms restrict to an action of U 1, n on the free semigroup algebra. The result is rather fundamental, being a higher dimensional version of the familiar M obius automorphism group on H . For the reader s convenience we provide complete proofs.

This completes the proof of the corollary. Proposition 4.6 Suppose z, w 0 u Bn Bm . Then there is a auto morphism z of Au that is unitarily implemented and such that, for every X Au, 0,w 1 z X z,w X where z,w is the character associated with z, w by Proposition 3.1. Proof. Let U be the unitary operator implementing . We can view F n, m, u as the sum F n, m, u X k F k F E where F E C E E E . We now let V be the unitary operator whose restriction to F k F E is Ik U where Ik is the identity operator on F k F E and whose restriction to F k . Next, we define V , w to be the unitary operator implementing , where = . We now check that these are auto morphisms. Since Ik and I k are auto morphisms, it follows that V, u ,u V ,v is an auto morphism for all u, v. We now check that V , u,w (X . ) = (X . . ) V , u,w . Note that V , u V,w acts as the identity operator on F k F E and on F k . Thus, we can restrict the operation of V , u V,w to F u F E and F ,w F E .

Chunk: hypothesis, this is equal to P k,l u i,j , k,l Lfl Lek Ik U . Using , this is Lei Lfj Ik U Lei Ik U Lfj . Since F k 1 F E is spanned by elements of the form Lfj as above the equality follows. From the relations of Lemma 4.4 it follows that the map z X V XV defines a unitary endomorphism of Au. Since is an automorphism of An it follows that z gives the desired automorphism. Clearly, in Proposition 4.6, we can interchange z and w to get the follow ing, where z, z w. Proposition 4.7 Suppose z, w 0 u Bn Bm . Then there is a unitary automorphism z,w of Lu which is a homeomorphism with respect to the w topologies and which restricts to an automorphism of Au. Moreover, for every X Lu, 0,0 1 z,w X z,w X where z,w is the character associated with z, w as in Proposition 3.1. An automorphism of Au, defines a map on the character space of Au, namely 7 1. Thus using Proposition 3.1 we have a homeomorphism of u. Also, since u Bn Bm is the interior of u, maps u Bn Bm onto itself. Similarly, if is an automorphism of Lu which is a homeomorphism with respect to the w topologies, then is a homeomorphism of u Bn Bm . In the following theorem we identify the relative interior of the core as the orbit of 0, 0 under the group of maps associated with automorphisms . Theorem 4.8 For z, w Bn Bm the following conditions are equivalent. z, w 0 u. 19 There exists a completely isometric automorphism of Lu that is a homeomorphism with respect to the w topologies and restricts to an automorphism of Au, such that 0, 0 z, w . There exists an algebraic automorphism of Au such that 0, 0 z, w . Proof. The proof that implies follows from Proposition 4.7. Clearly implies . It is left to show that implies . Given a point z, w u, we saw in Lemma 3.5 that, for every , satisfying there is a homomorphism z,w, , C F u T2. For z, w 0, 0 equation holds for every pair , . Since 0,0, , vanishes offa finite dimensional subspace, it is a bounded homomorphism. In fact, for every , , 0,0, , 1 . Given and z, w as in , for every , Cn Cm, 0,0, , 1 is a homomorphism on C F u and, thus, it is of the form z,w, , for some unique , satisfying . Write , , and note that this defines a continuous map. To prove the continuity, suppose n, n , and write n for 0,0, n, n and for 0,0, , . Then using the estimate on the norm of 0,0, , there is some M such that n M for all n and M. For every Y C F u , n Y Y . Now fix X Au and o 0. There is some Y C F u such that X Y o and there is some N such that for n N n Y Y o . Thus, for such n, n X X 2M 1 o .

If z, w is not in 0 u, then the set of all , satisfying is a subspace of Cn Cm of dimension strictly smaller than n m and, as is shown above, it contains the continuous image under the injective map of Cn Cm. This is impossible. 5 Isomorphic algebras In this section we shall find conditions for algebras Au and Av to be isomet rically isomorphic.

Chunk: generally dif fers very little among galaxies e.g., Harris 2001 Jorda n et al. 2006 . If this picture is basically correct, it implies that, even though MTO may appear nearly universal when considering the global mass functions of entire GC systems, in fact the GCMFs of subsamples of clusters with similar ages but dif ferent densities should have different turnovers. In 2, we show working for definiteness and relatively easy observ ability with the half mass density, h that this is the case for globulars in the Milky Way. We fit the observed dN d log M for GCs in bins of different h with models assuming that the initial distribution increased as a 2 power law at low masses and the mass loss rates of individual clusters can be estimated from their half mass densities by the rule ev 1 2 h . In 3 we discuss the validity of this prescription for ev, which is certainly approximate but captures the main physical dependence of relaxation driven mass loss. In par ticular, we show that the alternative mass loss laws ev 1 2 t and ev 3 4 t where t and t are the mean volume and surface densities inside cluster tidal radii lead to models for the GCMF that are essentially indistinguishable from those based on ev 1 2 h . The normalization of ev required to fit the observed GCMF implies cluster lifetimes that are within a factor of 2 perhaps slightly on the low side, if the ini tial power law exponent at low masses was 2 of typical values in theories and simulations of two body relaxation in tidally limited GCs. We also show in 2 that when the observed densities of in dividual clusters are used in our models to predict GCMFs in different bins of Galactocentric radius rgc , they fit the 6 Throughout this paper, we use initial to mean at a relatively early time in the development of long lived clusters, after they have dispersed any rem nants of their natal gas clouds, survived the bulk of stellar evolution mass loss, and come into virial equilibrium in the tidal field of a galaxy. much weaker variation of dN d log M and MTO as functions of rgc, which is well known in the Milky Way and other large galaxies see Harris 2001 Harris, Harris, McLaughlin 1998 Barmby, Huchra, Brodie 2001 Vesperini et al. 2003 Jorda n et al. 2007 . Similarly, applying our models to the GCs in two bins of central concentration, with only the mea sured h of the clusters in each subsample as input, suffices to account for previously noted differences between the mass functions of low and high concentration Galactic globulars Smith Burkert 2002 . The most fundamental feature of the GCMF therefore appears to be its dependence on cluster den sity, which can be understood at least qualitatively and even quantitatively, to within a factor of 2 in terms of evaporation dominated cluster disruption. There is a widespread perception that if the GCMF evolved slowly from a rising power law at low masses, then a weak or null variation of MTO with rgc can be achieved only in GC systems with strongly radially anisotropic velocity distribu tions, which are not observed see especially Vesperini et al. 2003 . This apparent inconsistency has been cited to bol ster some recent attempts to identify a mechanism by which a universal peak at MTO 105M might have been im printed on the GCMF at the time of cluster formation, or very shortly afterwards, and little affected by the subsequent destruction of lower mass GCs e.g., Vesperini Zepf 2003 Parmentier Gilmore 2007 . However, given the real suc cesses of an evaporation dominated evolutionary scenario for the origin of MTO, as summarized above and added to below, it would be premature to reject the idea in favor of

Chunk: , where is a primitive coproduct. The last two r matrices and satisfy the non homogeneous modified CYBE and they can be easily obtained from the solutions of the complex algebra o 4, C sl 2, C sl 2, C which describes the complexification of o 3, 1 . Indeed, let us introduce 4 the complex basis of Lorentz algebra o 3, 1 sl 2 C sl 2, C described by two commuting sets of complex generators h h , E1 1 2 e e , h h , E2 1 2 e e , which satisfy the relations compare with Hk, Ek Ek , Ek , Ek 2Hk , 2 . The operation describing the real structure acts on the generators Hk, and Ek , 2 as follows H , E 1 E2 , H , E 2 E1 . The classical r matrix r3, , and r4, , in terms of the complex basis , take the form 1 r 1 , r 3 2 E1 E1 2 E2 E2 , r 3 4 H2 H1 , and 4 r 4 , r 4 2 E1 E1 E2 E2 2H1 H2 , r 4 4 E1 E2 For the sake of convenience we introduce parameter6 in r 4. It should be noted that r 3, r 3 and r 4, r 4 are themselves classical r matrices. We see that the r matrix r 3 is simply a sum of two standard r matrices of sl 2 C , satisfying the anti Hermitian condition . Analogously, it is not hard to see that the r matrix r4 corresponds to a Belavin Drinfeld triple for the Lie algebra sl 2 C sl 2, C . Indeed, applying the Cartan automorphism E2 E2 , H2 H2 we see that this is really correct see also . We firstly describe quantum deformation corresponding to the classical r matrix r3 . Since the r matrix r 3 is Abelian and it is subordinated to r 3 therefore the algebra o 3, 1 is firstly quantized in the direction r 3 and then an Abelian twist corresponding to the r matrix r 3 is applied. We introduce the complex notations z . It should be noted that and are real, and and are pure imaginary. From structure of the classical r matrix r 3 it follows that a quantum deformation Ur 1 o 3, 1 is a combination of two q analogs of U sl 2 C with the parameter qz and qz , where qz exp z . Thus Ur 3 o 3, 1 Uqz sl 2 C Uqz sl 2 C and the standard generators q H1 z , E1 and q H2 z , E2 satisfy 6We can reduce this parameter to 1 2 by automorphism of o 4, C . 5 the following non vanishing defining relations qH1 z E1 q 1 z E1 qH1 z , E1 , E1 q2H1 z q 2H1 z qz q 1 z , qH2 z E2 q 1 z E2 qH2 z , E2 , E2 q2H2 z q 2H2 z qz q 1 z . In this case the co product r 1 and antipode Sr 1 for the generators q H1 z , E1 and q H2 z , E2 can be given by the formulas r 1 q H1 z q H1 z q H1 z , r 1 E1 E1 qH1 z q H1 z E1 , r 1 q H2 z q H2 z q H2 z , r 1 E2 E2 qH2 z q H2 z E2 , Sr 1 q H1 z q H1 z , Sr 1 E1 q 1 z E1 , Sr 1 q H2 z q H2 z , Sr 1 E2 q 1 z E2 .

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0082v1 cond mat.other 1 Apr 2007 Typeset with jpsj2. .1. , Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113 0033 We investigate dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finite background in the BEC , based on an integrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinear Schr odinger equation with a self focusing nonlineality. We apply the inverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. The resulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under vanishing boundary conditions. One soliton solutions are derived in an explicit manner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into two kinds, domain wall DW type and phase shift PS type. The DW type implies the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS type implies the polar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two soliton collisions. In particular, the spin mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a collision involving the DW type. The results are consistent with those of the previous studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and dark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness of the multiple matter wave solitons in the spinor BECs.

Phys. Soc. Jpn. Full Paper 1. Introduction In 2002, matter wave bright solitons in quasi one dimensional 1D Bose Einstein conden sates BECs were observed experimentally.1,2 Bright solitons propagate in most cases with much larger amplitudes than dark solitons,3,4 and are expected to have the potential for various applications such as coherent transport and atom interferometry. Soliton propagation in BEC can be described by the Gross Pitaevskii GP equation. The GP equation, called the nonlinear Schr odinger NLS equation in nonlinear science, is integrable and has soliton solu tions in a one dimensional and uniform system. Recent experimental and theoretical advances about matter wave bright solitons are reviewed, for instance, in ref. 5. The experimental creation of matter wave solitons has been so far achieved only for single component BEC. It is, nevertheless, very interesting to consider soliton propagation in BEC with internal degrees of freedom, so called, spinor BEC. When BEC of ultracold alkali atoms is trapped exclusively by optical means, the hyperfine spin of atoms remains liberated. The spinor BEC was realized in such a way.6 8 Internal degrees of freedom endow solitons with a multiplicity. The multiple solitons will show a rich variety of dynamics. Here, we focus on the boson system in the , exemplified by 23Na, 39K and 87Rb. The multi component GP equation for , which is mathematically equivalent to the matrix NLS equation. An integrable model with a self focusing nonlineality enables one to perform exact analysis via the inverse scatter ing method ISM for the matrix NLS equation.9 In particular, bright soliton solutions under vanishing boundary conditions VBC are obtained, whose properties are investigated in refs. 10 and 11. Recently, the ISM for the matrix NLS equation under nonvanishing boundary con ditions NVBC is formulated.12 Dark solitons in the .13 Although the ISM under NVBC is dedicated mainly to the self defocusing case, we note that this technique is also applicable to an integrable model with a self focusing nonlineality, which makes us available to bright soliton solutions with a finite background. In this paper, the detail of matter wave bright solitons in the quasi 1D , based on an integrable model. We consider matter wave spinor bright solitons traveling on a finite background of the condensate. We write down explicitly new soliton solutions, and verify that the obtained soliton solutions have the similar properties compared to those without a background. In the usual experimental setups, a strong confinement is typically applied to the condensates in the transverse direction.14 Therefore, the one dimensional condensate model is expected to be a good approximation in a long wavelength limit. Our results are applicable to the study of bright solitons for the one dimensional dynamics of BEC, in this case, the self focusing model. Although we consider the self focusing case in this paper, we would like to mention that our results are also applicable for the self defocusing case, where the inverse scattering transform and soliton solutions have been obtained by other groups.15 16

Chunk: Q becomes Q e i x,t 0 UUT 0Q , x . Q UUT is the so called Cholesky decomposition. The arbitrary boundary conditions Q other than eq. are thus realized via the SU transformation. On the other hand, the behavior in the limit x varies depending on whether det 0 or not, which will be discussed later for the one soliton case. There is another important concept about an integrable model. Due to the integrability, the model has the infinite conservation laws, which restrict the dynamics of the system in an essential way. Several conserved quantities, related to the physical quantities of the system, are listed below Total number n x, t , n x, t tr Q Q tr Q Q . Total spin F x, t , f x, t tr Q Q . Total momentum p x, t , p x, t i tr Q Qx tr Q Q ,x . Total energy e x, t , e x, t c tr Q xQx Q QQ Q tr Q ,xQ ,x Q Q Q Q . Here, x, y, z T are the Pauli matrices. To avoid the divergence of integrals, we should subtract the contribution of the background from the physical quantities, except the total spin, to which the background does not contribute explicitly. These subtractions are emphasized by the bars on the conserved densities and quantities. The local spin density fx, fy, fz T is covariant under the SU transformation , whereas the other densities such as n x, t , 6 18 J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. Full Paper p x, t and e x, t are invariant. The total macroscopic spin is directed to face to an arbitrary direction by the global spin rotation. The SU symmetry of the system causes the energy degenerated states of solitons for this spin rotation. 4. One Soliton Solutions In this section, one soliton solutions of the integrable spinor model are investigated in detail. We can derive the explicit form of one soliton solutions by setting in the formula . The calculation is complicated but straightforward.

Chunk: asymptotically two one solitons. The classification of one soliton solutions based on the values of the determinants of polarization matrices, discussed in the previous section, is thus valid for two soliton solutions. The derivation of the explicit form is more complicated than that in the case for one soliton solutions. For the derivative NLS equation under NVBC, explicit two soliton solutions and shifts of soliton positions due to collisions between solitons have been analytically obtained, in the case of purely imaginary eigenvalues, where complexity of calculation is considerably reduced.20 This strategy, however, does not stand in our NLS equation under NVBC. The reason is understood from eq. . In the spinor model, purely imaginary eigenvalues give two solitons with the same velocity 2k, and they do not collide with each other. Accordingly, we can not investigate the properties of collisions for purely imaginary discrete eigenvalues. No one has studied explicit multi soliton solutions of the NLS equation under NVBC, even in the single component case, because of the computational complexity. Here, we graphically show the characteristic behaviors of two soliton collisions in the spinor model, by use of the exact solutions given by the ISM. Referring to them, we carry out the qualitative discussions. Although the presented graphs are depicted for the specific parameters, much the same behaviors are observed for arbitrarily selected parameters. 13 18 J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. Full Paper Figure 2 illustrates the behavior of a mutual collision between two PS types, where det 1 0 and det 3 0. One can see that, in all three components, Both solitons re tain their shapes before and after the collision, which is the common property with solitons in the single component case. In this sense, PS PS soliton collision is essentially equivalent to two soliton collision of the single component NLS equation. Figure 3 illustrates the behavior of a mutual collision between DW type and PS type, where det 3 0. The behavior of collisions between DW type and PS type is qualitatively alien from that between two PS types. One observes that, in PS type, much of the population initially inhabiting the hyperfine substate , 1 is transferred into the hyperfine substate , due to the collision. In contrast, in DW type, such spin transfer does not occur, and the domain wall shape is preserved against the collision. This phenomenon can be interpreted as follows. DW type, with nonzero spin, can affect the internal spin state of PS type, whereas PS type, which is expected to have zero spin in total, does not affect the internal spin state of DW type. This kind of spin transfer phenomenon, called the spin switching, has been first predicted for the case of VBC.11 Due to the conservation laws, the total number, the total spin and so on are invariant throughout the collision process. Population mixing among internal degrees of freedom is permitted, as far as the conservation laws are not violated. The spin switching is one of the dynamical processes which make the spinor solitons more interesting. Finally, for a mutual collision between two DW types, where det , the shapes of both solitons are expected to be deformed by the collision since each soliton carries nonzero total spin. In fact, drastic population mixing is seen in Fig. 4, which shows an example of this kind of collisions. One finds that domain walls repel at the collision region, rather than collide. a b c Fig. 2.

Chunk: this is a sum over Everything. However, in terms of the observable quanti ties, like spacetime geometry, this distribution turns out to be nontrivially peaked around a particular set of uni verses. Semiclassically this distribution is given by the EQG density matrix and the saddle point instantons of the above type . From the normalization of the density matrix in the physical Hilbert space the statistical sum follows as the path integral Z dq q, i q q, q q Z periodic D q, p, N e i R dt p q N H , where the integration runs over periodic in time histo ries of t . Here q, i q is the mea sure which distinguishes the physical inner product in the space of solutions of the Wheeler DeWitt equations 1 2 from that of the space of square integrable functions, R dq 1 2. This measure includes the delta function of unitary gauge conditions and an operator factor built with the aid of the relevant ghost determinant . On the other hand, in terms of the physical phase space variables the Faddeev Popov path integral equals Z D q, p, N e i R dt p q N H Z Dqphys Dpphys ei R dt pphys qphys Hphys t Trphys T e i R dt Hphys t , where T denotes the chronological ordering. Here the physical Hamiltonian Hphys t and its operator realiza tion Hphys t are nonvanishing only in unitary gauges ex plicitly depending on time , t q, p, t 0. In static gauges, t 0, they identically vanish, because in spa tially closed cosmology the full Hamiltonian reduces to the combination of constraints. The path integral is gauge independent on shell and coincides with that in the static gauge. Therefore, from Eqs. with , the sta tistical sum of our microcanonical ensemble equals e Trphys sum over Everything. This ultimate equipartition, not modulated by any non trivial density of states, is a result of general covariance and closed nature of the Universe lacking any freely speci fiable constants of motion. The volume integral of entire 3 physical phase space, whose structure and topology is not known, is very nontrivial. However, below we show that semiclassically it is determined by EQG methods and supported by instantons of spanning a bounded range of the cosmological constant. Integration over momenta in yields a Lagrangian path integral with a relevant measure and action e Z D q, N eiSL q, N . Integration runs over periodic fields not indicated ex plicitly but assumed everywhere below even despite the Lorentzian signature of the underlying spacetime. Sim ilarly to the procedure of leading to in the Euclidean case, we decompose q, N into a min isuperspace aL t , NL t and the matter L x vari ables, the subscript L indicating their Lorentzian na ture. With a relevant decomposition of the measure D q, N D aL, NL D L x , the microcanonical sum takes the form e Z D aL, NL ei L aL, NL , ei L aL, NL Z D L x eiSL aL, NL L x , where L aL, NL is a Lorentzian effective action. The stationary point of is a solution of the effective equa tion L NL t 0. In the gauge it, a aL t , i R dt aL t . However, with these identifications C turns out to be purely imaginary in view of the complex nature of the free energy F i R dt aL . Therefore, no periodic solu tions exist in spacetime with a real Lorentzian metric. On the contrary, such solutions exist in the Euclidean spacetime. Alternatively, the latter can be obtained with the time variable unchanged , aL t a , but with the Wick rotated lapse function , iSL aL, NL L SE a, N . In the gauge these solutions

Queries:
1. What is the relationship between the statistical sum and the density matrix in the context of the observable quantities in EQG?
2. How is the measure in the path integral differentiated between physical inner product and space of square integrable functions in EQG?
3. How does the full Hamiltonian reduction affect the path integral in static gauge?


Answer:
1. The statistical sum is derived from the normalization of the density matrix in the physical Hilbert space, which describes the distribution of universes in terms of observable quantities like spacetime geometry.
2. The measure in thepath integral distinguishes between the physical inner product in the space of solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equations and that of the space of square integrable functions, by involving a delta function of unitary gauge conditions and an operator factor built with the aid of the relevant ghost determinant.
3. The full Hamiltonian is non-vanishing only in unitary gauges, which depend on time and explicitly reduce the Hamiltonian in static gauges. The path integral is gauge-independent on-shell, and coincides with that in the static gauge. In static gauges, due to the full Hamiltonian reduction, the path integral vanishes

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0084v2 cond mat.soft 9 May 2007 Formation of density singularities in ideal hydrodynamics of freely cooling inelastic gases a family of exact solutions Itzhak Fouxon, Baruch Meerson, Michael Assaf, and Eli Livne Racah Institute of Physics, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 91904, Israel Dated February 18, 2013 We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of clustering of par ticles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider large scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We em ploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non stationary analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups signal formation of close packed clusters of particles. As the density blow up time tc is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law tc t 2. The velocity gradient blows up as tc t 1 while the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp rather than a shock discontinuity at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario the gas pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an ordinary shock, at which the hydrody namic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the exact solutions with respect to small one dimensional perturbations by solving the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally, independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions. PACS numbers 45.70.Qj, 47.40. x I. INTRODUCTION Structure formation in many body systems is one of central problems of non equilibrium physics. A most spectacular phenomena of structure formation is clus tering of matter. Here an initially structureless, al most homogeneous distribution of particles of matter self assembles into clusters. Such an evolution cannot proceed indefinitely in a gas where interactions between the particles are i short range and ii Hamiltonian. There are two important classes of gases where one of these two properties is violated, and clustering can oc cur. In the first one long range forces, such as gravity, are present. Clustering provides here a natural mech anism of star formation1 and of the large scale struc ture of the Universe2. The second class of systems are dissipative systems where interactions between the par ticles, at the level of an effective description, are non Hamiltonian. One well known example is optically thin gases and plasmas that cool by their own radiation, and dense condensations develop3,4,5. In this paper we con sider a more basic non Hamiltonian many body system a gas of inelastically colliding macroscopic particles, or granular gas. Here particles lose energy to their internal degrees of freedom. The granular gas is the low density limit of granular flows6,7. In its simplest version, the granular gas model deals with a dilute assembly of identical hard spheres with diameter and unit mass who lose energy at in stantaneous binary collisions in such a way that the nor mal component of the relative velocity of particles is re duced by a constant factor 0 the coefficient of normal restitution upon each collision. Granular gases exhibit a plethora of structure forming instabilities, in cluding the clustering instability of a freely cooling ho mogeneous inelastic gas8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. This instability brings about the generation of a macroscopic flow and formation of dense clusters of particles. The natural language for a theoretical description of macroscopic flows of a granular gas is the Navier Stokes granular hydrodynamics6,7. Although the criteria

Chunk: progresses, the two symmetric density peaks move toward the origin, reaching it pre cisely at the time of singularity. The pressure still has a maximum at , while in view of Eqs. the time of singularity is still cosh a. Instead of looking for the maxima of m , it is convenient to look for the min ima of the inverse density which, by virtue of Eq. , can be written as 0 m, t 1 cos m q 1 tanh2 a cos2 m 2 t 1 1 tanh2 a cos2 m 1 4 t 2 cos m . Differentiating this function with respect to m one can verify that at cosh a the minimum is indeed at . Finally, at acr the density blows up sym metrically at two Eulerian points x m0, tc 0, where 1 arccos p 2 3 coth a 0. Using the first of Eq. we find tc 33 4 2 1 2 tanh a.

The insets in a and d zoom on the density and temperature profiles, respectively, at .45 and clearly show the pres ence of two symmetric peaks at x 0 developing density blowups simultaneously. The units are the same as in Figs. 1 and 2. D. Solutions with mass distributed over a finite interval of x If m, 0 does not vanish at m 2 , or vanishes slower than linearly there, then the integral in Eq. converges, and the total gas mass is distributed over a finite interval of x. It follows from Eq. that the velocity which vanishes at 0 and has a negative gradient everywhere takes finite values at the ends of the interval over which the mass is distributed. As a result, the x interval, occupied by the gas, shrinks in the course of evolution. Assuming for simplicity that m, 0 is an even function of m, we find from Eqs. and that the interval L t , L t , occupied by the gas, shrinks with time as L t L 2 t Z 2 0 s A cos m m , 0 dm At2 and reaches its minimum at . This minimum is al ways positive except in the degenerate case of m, 0 0 cos m , when the whole gas collapses into the point . It turns out that, in this degenerate case, the solution is self similar in the Eule rian coordinates x and t and separable in the Lagrangian coordinates m and t. It can be shown that all self similar solutions with a finite energy have an infinite density at some locations already at . Such initial conditions do not correspond to a dilute gas, so they will not be considered here. 9 A generic example of the solution on a finite Eule rian interval is provided by the uniform initial density m, 0 0. In the Eulerian coordinates this choice corresponds to the constant initial density, x, 0 0, at the interval l 2, l 2 . The solutions be come p m, t 0T0 cos m , m, t 0 1 t p cos m

Chunk: density blows up at the ori gin . As a result, the pressure versus x has a local maximum at , and the value of the maximum stays constant in time p , t 2A.

At x, tc p 0, tc 1 1 2 5x lb2 2 5 , x l 2 5 1 . 11 In the generic case, where the maximum of m, 0 cos m is not at zero, so that m0 0, the singularity develops at a point which is not special for the pressure. Here the Taylor expansion of Eq. yields p m m0 2 m m0 sin m0 O 2 m m0 2 . In this case we find p xc, tc p xc, tc 1 tan m0 5 x xc lb2 1 5 , that holds at x xc l 1 5 1. Note that the local x dependence of the pressure at , or velocity gradient. First, the pressure remains finite at . Second, even though the pressure gradient diverges at , the divergence stems from a small correction term to a constant pres sure, see Eq. and . As we discuss later, this difference in behavior is crucial for understanding the physical nature of the singularity. Now let us investigate the local structure of the flow immediately before the singularity at tc t tc. The leading terms of the double Taylor expansion of the in verse density u m, t u m, 0 1 t m 2 in a vicinity of tc that is, at m m0 1 and 1 are the following u m, t u m0, 0 2 2b 2 m m0 2 b2 4 m m0 4 we recall .

Now, x m, t xc t R m m0 u m , t dm can be written as x m, t xc t 1 t tc 5 2 m m0 p 1 t tc , where y R y 0 U y dy . Evaluating this integral, we arrive at the self similar form in the Eulerian coordinates u x, t u x0, 0 1 t tc 2 1 bF 2 x xc t l 1 t tc 5 2 2 , where the function F z is defined implicitly by the fifth order polynomial equation b2F 5 z 5 2bF 3 z 3 F z z that has a unique real solution. Equation holds at x that satisfy the strong inequality 1 t tc 1 2 F x xc t l 1 t tc 5 2 1 , corresponding to the condition m m0 1 in Eq. . The asymptotes of F z are F z z , z2 1 , 5z b2 1 5 , z2 5 1 . The applicability condition is determined by the z 1 asymptote of F z and simplifies to x xc t l 1 5 1 . The same condition guarantees the validity of the power law density profile at . Therefore, near the singularity the density has the fol lowing self similar form x, t x0, 0 1 1 t tc 2 R x xc t l 1 t tc 5 2 , where R z 1 1 bF 2 z 2. In the region correspond ing to z 1 one has R z 1. That is, x, t develops a plateau in a narrow region near xc t that we will call the inner region.

Chunk: At intermediate distances, or in the outer region, x xc t l 1 t tc 5 2 2 5 1, x xc t l 1 5 1 , the time independent power law builds up. At x xc t l 1 5 1. The development of the singular profile of the velocity gradient can be inferred by going back to Eq. v tc t 1 bF 2 z , x xc t l 1 t tc 5 2 . Thus xv develops a plateau tc t cf. Eq. in the inner region, while the power law described by Eq. sets in the outer region in the same way as the density power law. The development of the pressure profile as t approaches tc is different in the case of 0. In the former case we have p x, t p 0, t 1 1 t tc 2 F 2 x l 1 t tc 5 2 , that holds at x l 2 5 1. In the inner region, x l 1 t tc 5 2 2 1, p x, t p 0, t 1 1 1 t tc 4 x2 2l2 , 12 while in the outer region the time independent profile sets it. In the generic case of m0 0 we obtain, for x xc t l 1 5 1, p x, t p xc t , t 1 tan m0 p 1 t tc F x xc t l 1 t tc 5 2 . In the inner region this yields p x, t p xc t , t 1 tan m0 x xc t l 1 t tc 2 , whereas the time independent profile sets in the outer region. We observe that in the inner region, x xc t l 1 5 1, the pressure is approximately con stant. This suggests that the sound waves are the fastest physical process near the singularity. Before we consider the hierarchy of time scales in more detail, let us reiter ate that the finite time singularity described here is quite different from the free flow singularity24 where the den sity blows up as tc t 1, the plateau of the inner region shrinks with time as tc t 3 2, the power law tail in the outer region is x2 3, and where the Lagrangian veloc ity, rather than the Lagrangian acceleration, is constant in time. G. Time scale separation and isobaric scenario In general, there are three time scales that characterize the dynamics described by the nonlinear IGHD equations and the sound travel time tsound L T, the cooling time tcooling 1 T , and the inertial time tinertial L v. Here , T , and v are typical values of the fields, while t is the characteristic spatial scale of the flow. The evolution of the hydrodynamic fields can produce time scale separation a strong inequality between the time scales. Moreover, the hierarchy of the time scales can be different in different regions of space. Let us evaluate the time scales for our exact solutions . Here there are only two independent time scales the sound travel and the cooling time scales. This stems from the fact that the compressional heating and the inelastic cooling balance each other in the equation for the pressure, so that tinertial tcooling.

Using the inverse function t0 m , we demand the second and third conditions in Eq. , f m t0 m p A cos m s 1 u0 m 1 , 2 Z m 0 f m p A cos m dm 2A t0 m sin m v0 s 4Au0 m cos m 1 . on the interval 2 . Using Eqs. and , we can express f m via u0 m f m Z m 0 s u0 m cos m 1 cos m dm s 1 u0 m 1 . Note that this relation does not include the parameter A. We now substitute Eq. into Eq. and arrive at a closed equation for u0 m 2 2 Z m 0 dm cos m Z m 0 dm s u0 m 1 cos m 2 Z m 0 dm s 1 u0 m cos m 1 2 sin m Z m 0 s u0 m 1 cos m dm v0 A s 4u0 m cos m 1 . This cumbersome equation is a linear integral equation for the function p u0 m , and it is soluble analytically. Changing the order of integration in the first term of the equation, we rewrite the first term as 2 2 Z m 0 dm s u0 m 1 cos m Z m m cos m dm 2 sin m Z m 0 dm s u0 m 1 cos m 2 Z m 0 dm sin m s u0 m 1 cos m .

The density, velocity, pressure and temperature are rescaled to 0, v0, 0v2 0 and v2 0, respectively, and 2. The density blows up at the piston, , at the rescaled time tcv0 2 3. The rescaled Lagrangian coordinate of the shock at the blowup time is 1.08031 . . .. the shock. The final form of the solution in the down stream region, 0 t , is p m, t 1 0v2 0 cos m 2 , m, t 0 1 cos m m 1 m t t 2 , v m, t v0 Z m 0 dz cos z h z p 1 z i v0 t t sin m . This solution is shown in Fig. 6. Note that, at fixed 0 and v0, the characteristic spatial and temporal scales of the solution behave as 1 . For this solution, the gas density blows up in a finite time at the point m where the function m 1 m has its minimum. One can easily see that, for 2, this function is mono tone increasing with m. As a consequence, the density blows up at the piston that is, at , and this happens at 1 t . At this time, the shock front location m mf t is described by the relation m 1 which yields .08031 . . . for 2 in 2d and 0.87915 . . . for 5 3 in 3d . That is, by the time , the shock has traveled only a finite distance both in the m , and in the x space from the piston. It is obvious, therefore, that our solution allows an arbitrary modification of the density profile 0 x at sufficiently large x that are unreachable for the shock. This clearly shows that initial states with an arbitrary large mass of gas can develop a finite time density blowup. V. NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS We confirmed the exact solutions, presented in Figs. 1 4 and 6, by solving numerically the IGHD equations and in the Lagrangian coordinates. In each case we used the initial and boundary conditions, provided by the exact solutions themselves. We employed the classical artificial viscosity, staggered grid scheme of von Neumann and Richtmyer31. The number of cells grid points used varied between 1000 and 2000 and showed numerical convergence until close to the singularity. As the solution developed a density blowup, the simulation had to be terminated at a very high but finite maximum density usually at about 107 0, where 0 is the initial density. We also enforced the simulations to stop when the density jump between two adjacent cells exceeded a prescribed value, usually 50 percent. When such jumps develop near the singularity, the accuracy of the simu lation degrades and can be restored only by a rezoning algorithm that was not employed. One example of the numerical solution is shown in Fig. 1 alongside with the analytical solution, and very good agreement is observed. Very good agreement was also obtained for the solutions shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 6 not shown . The numerical solutions inevitably add some effective noise to the sys tem because of the spatial and temporal discretization and round offerrors. The fact that the analytical so lutions are accurately reproduced numerically confirms their stability with respect to small one dimensional per turbations. We also performed extensive numerical simulations with Eqs. and for a variety of initial and bound ary conditions that did not correspond to any of

Let me ensure that I have captured your query correctly. Here is my understanding of the topic:

The text primarily discusses the intricacies and challenges related to the dynamics of granular gases. It points out that non-stationary flows of granular gases present a tough problem for continuum models of granular flows. The text mentions that such flows are a severe test for these models, as they can cause finite time singularities, such as the predicted density blowup in freely cooling granular gases at zero gravity and at finite gravity. The non-stationary flows are characterized by the continuous development of the shear mode, corresponding to the growth of a macroscopic solenoidal flow, and the clustering mode, which leads to the formation of clusters of particles. The clustering mode enters a fully developed nonlinear regime once the perturbations reach a certain scale. The paper proposely addresses the challenge by exploring new

Chunk: the same time the gas density at the origin continues growing and ultimately blows up. The density growth in a vicinity of the origin is presented in panel b . Panel c focuses on the density and pres sure history at the origin. While the density blows up at , the pressure hardly varies there so the isobaric sce nario holds. The inset of panel c verifies that, close to tc, the density blowup proceeds as tc t 2. Panels d and e add more tests of the spatial and temporal scal ing behavior near the singularity. Panel d shows a plot of the rescaled density x, t tc t 2 versus the rescaled coordinate x tc t 5 2. The collapse of the curves at different times proves the local self similarity note that the gas density at the origin varies, for these times, by four orders of magnitude . Finally, panel e verifies the presence of the inner and outer regions, described by our theory, see subsection III F. The density plateau, whose size shrinks as tc t 5 2, represents the inner region, while in the outer region a time independent density pro file forms with a power law behavior x 4 5 as pre dicted by our exact solutions. The same universal features of the singularity were also observed when starting from small amplitude sinusoidal density or velocity perturbations around a homogeneous state. VI. NON IDEAL EFFECTS NEAR THE SINGULARITY Having found the exact nonlinear solutions of the IGHD equations and , we are in the position to test the assumptions behind these equations and establish the domain of validity of the solutions as accurate leading order descriptions in the presence of non ideal effects. First, the validity of the Navier Stokes hydrodynamics, Eqs. , demands that the Knudsen number lfree L remain much smaller than unity. The smallest hydrody 17 namic length scale of the solution can be estimated as L t l 1 t tc 5 2, see subsections III F and III G. The mean free path lfree 1 d 1 1 t tc 2 0 d 1 . As l 1 0 and 1 r d 1, we obtain lfree L 1 r p 1 t tc . At . However, as t approaches tc, the Knudsen number grows indefinitely which invalidates the hydrody namics. We shall see, however, that one of the assump tions of the IGHD breaks down even earlier. Now consider the ratio of the viscous stress term to the pressure gradient term in the momentum equation . This ratio can be estimated as 0 T xv T 0 mv T. We first estimate all the ratios in the inner region, see subsection III F. As both mv and T van ish linearly as t tc, their ratio depends on time only weakly, and can be estimated by its value at . As mv m, 0 T see subsection III A , we find 0 x T xv x T 1 r , that is the viscous stress is always negligible in our solu tions as long as 1 r 1. The same estimate up to the sign holds for the ratio of the viscous heating term to the compressional heating term in Eq. 0 1 T xv 2 1 T xv 1 r 1 . In contrast to the viscous terms, the heat conduction term in Eq. , which is initially small in our solutions, does become important near the singularity. We estimate the ratio of the heat conduction term to the inelastic cooling term as follows 0 x T xT T 3 2 0 2L2 1 r 1 t tc . The same estimate is obtained for the ratio of the heat conduction term to the compressional heating term. This ratio becomes of order unity at 1 t tc 1 r 1. At this time lfree L

Chunk: of a freely cooling gas of inelastically collid ing disks in a long and narrow channel18. The MD sim ulations supported the free flow blow up scenario until the time when the gas density approached the hexagonal close packing value, and the further density growth was arrested. As we have recently found22, the free flow asymptotics does not hold all the way to the density blowup. Very close, in time and in space, to the attempted free flow singularity, the compressional heating starts to act and temporarily stabilizes the gas temperature at a small but finite value. As a result, the gas pressure again be comes important it breaks the purely inertial dynamics and, though unable to stop the density blowup, dramat ically changes the local blowup properties. It turns out that, after a brief crossover, the further dynamics obey a new blowup scenario, not limited to the long wavelength limit22. The new scenario has the following features. As the blow up time tc is approached, the maximum den sity exhibits a power law tc t 2. The velocity gradient blows up as tc t 1, whereas the veloc ity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp, rather than a shock discontinuity, at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the singularity, but the pressure there remains finite. This blowup, which obeys the above asymptotic laws near the singularity, emerges universally, that is for generic initial and boundary conditions. Note that, in the long wavelength limit, the crossover from the free flow regime to the finite pressure regime does not happen when the initial gas density is not very small. In this case excluded particle volume effects interfere in the dynamics, and arrest the density growth, before the crossover has a chance to occur, as indeed was observed in Ref.18. These findings are based on extensive numerical sim ulations numerical solutions of the hydrodynamic equa tions for a host of initial and boundary conditions and a family of exact analytical solutions of the hydrodynamic equations, without and with shocks, briefly announced in Ref.22. In the present work we give a detailed account of the exact solutions and investigate their structure close to the singularity. We verify the exact solutions numer ically. We show that the singularity follows the isobaric scenario the gas pressure is approximately uniform in space and constant in time in a close vicinity of the de veloping singularity. Finally, we evaluate the validity of the exact solutions close to the singularity by estimating the role of additional physical processes the viscosity, heat conduction and excluded particle volume effects. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II we introduce the equations of ideal granular hydrodynamics IGHD and discuss their general prop erties. In Section III we employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a family of exact solutions of the IGHD equa tions, consider some particular cases of the solutions and investigate global and local properties of the solutions. In Section IV we adapt the exact solutions to describe a different setting, where a piston moves into a granular gas at rest, and a density blowup, developing at the piston, coexists with an ordinary shock wave propagating into the gas. Besides demonstrating the presence of the two 3 different types of singularities in the same system, this so lution allows an arbitrary initial density profile at large distances, showing that the density blowup is a local pro cess. Section V presents the results of numerical solutions of the IGHD equations that confirm stability of the exact solutions with respect to small one dimensional pertur bations and establish universality of the density blowup for different initial conditions. In Section VI we discuss the role of non ideal effects, neglected in our solutions, close to the singularity. In Section VII we summarize our results and discuss their bearing on cluster formation.

Chunk: Let us introduce Lagrangian coordinates. The coordi nates x m, t of the fluid particles obey the equation x m, t x m, t , t , where m is a continuous label a Lagrangian coordinate of particles. The defining property of the exact solutions that we are going to present is independence of the par ticle accelerations 2 t x m, t of time the fluid particle coordinates x m, t satisfy the equation x m, t x m, 0 v m, 0 t a m, 0 t2 2 , where v m, 0 and a m, 0 are the initial velocities and accelerations of the fluid particles, respectively. As we will see later, the total mass of gas is finite for our solu tions. As a result, the pressure must vanish at the bound aries, implying existence of a point with a zero pressure gradient and, therefore, a zero particle acceleration in between. A fluid particle that has a zero acceleration that is conserved in our solutions moves with a con stant velocity, and we choose to work in such a frame of reference where this particle is at rest, so that the condi tions v , t 0 and xp , t 0 are obeyed. It is convenient to choose the Lagrangian coordinate m to be the mass coordinate29 m x, t Z x 0 x , t dx that is the mass content between the Eulerian points 0 and x. The inverse transformation x m, t is x m, t Z m 0 dm m , t . In the Lagrangian coordinates Eqs. and look simpler t 1 v m, v , p p v m p3 2 1 2 . Let us calculate the Lagrangian acceleration 2x m, t m, t m , 5 where we have used Eqs. and . For the solu tions obeying Eq. , the Lagrangian pressure gradient mp m, t should be independent of time. Since the pres sure p m, t is time independent and zero at the gas boundaries, it can depend only on m. Then Eqs. and yield 2p 2p, where 2. In view of the zero acceleration at the origin, mp 0, t 0, Eq. yields m , where A is constant. The resulting family of solutions is p m, t 2A cos m , m, t m, 0 1 t p A m, 0 cos m 2 , v m, t 2 Z m 0 s A cos m m , 0 dm 2A t sin m , where we have used the condition v , t 0. This family of solutions describes a compression flow the ve locity gradient is negative everywhere , as the compres sional heating is balanced, in Eq. , by the inelastic cooling. The solutions include an arbitrary non negative function m, 0 the initial gas density. The arbitrary constant , together with m, 0 , determines the time dependent Mach number of the flow, appears due to the rescaling symmetry of the equations and corre sponds to the constant in Eq. . One can check that the constant in Eq. corresponds to the freedom of multiplying m, 0 and A by . As the pressure p must be non negative, and vanish at the finite or infinite boundaries of the freely moving gas, the solutions can hold only on a finite interval 2 , 2 we assume that the gas region is single connected, and the interval includes . Therefore, the total mass of the gas in these solutions is finite and fixed by parameters and R x, 0 2 . Once the solutions in the Lagrangian coor dinates are known, we can return to the Eulerian coor dinates by using, at any time t, Eq. . Depending on the particular choice of the initial density, there are two possible types of solutions . First, the fixed mass of

Chunk: the gas can be distributed, at , over either an infinite, or a finite x interval. This is deter mined by the behavior of m, 0 near 2 . For example, let m, 0 2 m 1 a near 2 . Then it follows from Eq. that the gas occupies an infinite correspondingly, a finite interval of positive x if a 0 correspondingly, . The velocity can be either finite, or infinite at the gas boundaries. For example, for the same behavior of the initial density m, 2 m 1 a near 2 one ob tains a finite correspondingly, infinite gas velocity at 2 for correspondingly, a 2 . Now let us consider what types of initial conditions evolve according to Eqs. and discuss the density blowup that is brought by this evolution. B. Initial conditions and density blowup for the exact solutions A particular member of our family of exact solutions is determined by a specific choice of the con stant m, 0 0, de fined on the interval 2 , 2 . In the Eulerian coordinates one can specify an arbitrary initial density profile x, 0 that has a fixed total mass Z x, 0 . Once x, 0 and A are specified, one needs to choose the origin so that the gas masses to the left and to the right of the origin are the same and equal to 2 . Then the initial gas pressure in the Eulerian coordinates is p x, 0 2A cos Z x 0 x , 0 dx . Now, using Eq. , we calculate the velocity gradient in the Eulerian coordinate at v x, 0 m, 0 v m, 0 p A m, 0 cos m . which, in view of the condition v , t 0, yields v x, 0 Z x 0 p 2 x , 0 p x , 0 dx with p x, 0 from Eq. . Equations and show that, once x, 0 is a smooth function of x, then the initial pressure and velocity are smooth functions as well. Let us now proceed to the properties of the solutions. As we already noted, these solutions describe a motion of fluid particles with a time independent acceleration, see Eq. . This time independent acceleration is a m, 0 p m, 0 A sin m . The evolution described by Eqs. brings about a singularity of this initially smooth flow m, t blows up in a finite time, while the rest of the flow variables the pressure and velocity remain finite. The density blow up occurs at the Lagrangian point m0 where m, 0 cos m reaches its maximum m0, 0 cos m0 max m, 0 cos m . Interestingly, the point m0 corresponds, in view of Eq. , to the point of the absolute negative mini mum of the velocity gradient in the Eulerian coordinates, 6 just as in the case of the free flow that is, zero pressure singularity24. The singularity occurs when the Jacobian of the Lagrangian transformation of the fluid particles vanishes for the first time mx , tc 0. For the time tc and the Eulerian coordinate of the singularity x0 we find p A m0, 0 cos m0 , m0, tc Z m0 0 dm m , tc . At the fixed Lagrangian point of singularity m0 the density blows up as m0, t m0, 0 1 t tc 2 . In the Eulerian coordinates the blowup develops, in gen eral, in a moving point x m0, t , t x m0, 0 , 0 1 t tc 2 . The velocity gradient at the singularity point x m0, t diverges. The divergence law can be easily found in the Langrangian coordinates, by using the continuity equa tion and Eqs. and v x, t x m0,t m, t v m, t m t ln m, t 2 tc t . Finally,

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0085v2 hep th 9 Apr 2007 DAMTP 2007 30 A Universality in PP Waves Partha Mukhopadhyay Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics University of Cambridge Wilberforce Road, Cambridge CB3 0WA, UK E mail P.Mukhopadhyay damtp.cam.ac.uk Abstract We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in space time expanded around pp wave backgrounds. According to this property the space time lagrangian den sity evaluated on a restricted set of field configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the pp waves, even off shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on shell pp waves and ar gue that universality requires the existence of a universal sector of world sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to the pp wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results can also be reproduced using the world sheet confor mal field theory. We also study such pp waves in non polynomial closed string field theory CSFT . In particular, we argue that for an off shell pp wave ansatz with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this simplification it is expected that the off shell pp waves can be identified on the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp wave field configurations, an iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses can be generalised to the common Neveu Schwarz sector of superstrings. 1 Contents 1 Introduction and Summary 2 2 A Universality in PP Waves 7 3 Universality on World Sheet 10 3.1 Constant Dilaton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 3.2 Non Constant Dilaton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 3.3 Generalisation to NSR Superstrings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17 4 PP Waves in Closed String Field Theory 19 4.1 Effective Field Theory . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 4.2 Closed String Field Theory . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21 A A Proof of Universality 27 B Closure of Universal Sector under Field Redefinition 30 C Correlators in Constant Dilaton 30 D Correlators in Non Constant Dilaton 33 E Field Redefinition and Gauge Transformation 36 1 Introduction and Summary In a previous work we argued that string theory in the maximally supersymmetric type IIB plane wave background with constant five form Ramond Ramond RR flux RR plane wave possesses a universality property. According to this property there exists a universal sector of string configurations for which the classical space time action evaluated around the RR plane wave takes the same value as in flat space. The argument leading to this property involved showing that the relevant light cone world sheet theory has certain properties that are required to hold in order for the universal sector to exist. By looking at the other examples of pp waves where string theory has been studied in light cone gauge, this universality

Chunk: by 1 and 1, k respectively in . 15 Generalising this to an n 2 point vertex one gets f p, k, k i pu ku n X i u 24 p k n X k i f p, k, k i X 2 N N! Z N Y a l a ! pu ku n X i u N X a 24 p k n X k i , where it is understood that each of the momenta appearing in the argument of the fac tor f p, k, k i has zero covariant v component. Notice also that the above equation is schematic in the sense that depending on the vertex f can carry space time indices. For the two point vertex considered above f is a scalar as the gravitons are contracted be tween each other. But there are terms where the gravitons are contracted with momenta. In such cases f will carry the necessary indices. Since the vertex is computed from a CFT correlator we conclude from the expression that a generic matter correlator that appears in the computation of Spp US with a non constant dilaton is given by, I h OouteikuU i k. X 0, 0 i n Y i u U i k i . X zi, zi ! OineipuU i p. X 0, 0 pp u X 2 N N! Z N Y a l a ! I Ooutei ku PN a U i k. X 0, 0 n Y i u U i k i . X zi, zi ! OineipuU i p. X 0, 0 flat 0 , for Oout , Oin , Oi OUS , i . where I is the inversion map I z 1 z. The correlator on the left side is computed in CFTpp, where the background contains a non constant dilaton u . The correlators on the right side are computed in CFTflat with the dilaton set to zero. Notice that the right hand side can be computed in any other relevant background with 0 as the computation is done in the universal sector. To check a simple consistency condition if the left hand side is computed in a background with constant dilaton u c, then one sets k c k on the right side. The result turns out to be e 2c times the same correlator computed with u 0, which is expected. Notice also that eq. is 16 claimed only for the universal sector generically the result will be complicated if we sprinkle around non universal operators inside the correlator. The derivation of the result using path integral has been presented in appendix D. Notice that the above argument is based on the universality of U u, x in the sense of eqs. 3.11, 3.12 and we have not explicitly addressed the potential background dependence of the CSFT quadratic term through the energy momentum tensor as we did in the case of constant dilaton. In presence of a non trivial dilaton u , the energy momentum tensor receives a correction of the following form in addition to that in eq. over its flat space expression T pp U 2 U , 2U U Z dl l2 l eilU , This operator belongs to OUS and is independent of V . Therefore by the same argument as given below eq. , a matter correlator involving T pp and an arbitrary number of operators inside OUS is zero in flat space with constant dilaton. Then using eq. we conclude, pp u 0 , where Qpp is the dilaton contribution to the BRST operator Qpp which is linear in T pp . This shows that there is no dependence of the CSFT action on the background dilaton inside the universal sector that might be introduced through the BRST operator. This is consistent with the fact that U u, x is independent of the background dilaton, as

Chunk: transformations. The off shell ansatz in is not gauge invariant and therefore has been written by fixing some of the gauge symmetries. Some 20 amount of residual gauge symmetry is still present which preserve the above ansatz. This has been discussed in appendix E. All the corrections in are not identically zero for the generic ansatz . The equations of motion reduce to the following form , , 1 2 2 K u IAI 1 4 FIJF IJ HIJHIJ 2 2 u 1 C2 F, H 0 , where FIJ and HIJ have been defined in eqs. and respectively. The last equation generically receives corrections to all orders. All such corrections, collectively given by the term C2 F, H , are quadratic in FIJ and or HIJ, but contain arbitrary higher powers of transverse derivatives . In a special case where both FIJ and HIJ are independent of the transverse coordinates u , u , all such corrections drop off. Notice that the last equation in is invariant under adding a purely u dependent function to K u, x K u, x K u, x f u . The fact that the equations are at most quadratic in fields will be crucial in our following discussion on CSFT. 4.2 Closed String Field Theory As mentioned earlier, here we shall formulate the problem of identifying the off shell pp wave configuration in CSFT. We denote the set of dynamical fields of CSFT by , where massive is the set of infinite number of massive fields. After integrating out the full set massive one arrives at a low energy effective field theory containing only g , b , D and certain additional non dynamical fields that can be eliminated away algebraically. See for the details of the procedure. The field redefinition that relates these dynamical fields and that of EFT takes the following form h v, u, x h v, u, x f h h , b , D , b v, u, x b v, u, x f b h , b , D , D v, u, x D v, u, x f D h , b , D , 21 where in the last equation derivative of the dilaton has been considered in order to make the equation insensitive to a constant shift which was also left unfixed while writing down the EFT action in . It was shown in that at the linearised level the field redefinition takes the form of the above equations with all the f fields set to zero. Therefore all such fields are necessarily at higher orders in the hatted fields. Notice that we have also used the well known fact that the dilaton always appears with derivatives in these fields. We have argued in appendix E that for a generic off shell pp wave background the only non vanishing f function is the component f h uu h , b , D which takes the following form f h uu , , , u K2 AI, BI, u , where K2 AI, BI, u is an undetermined scalar on the transverse space which is second order in the fields AI, BI and but may contain transverse derivatives of arbitrarily high order. Notice that such transverse derivatives can not act on . Therefore, by the similar argument as in appendix E, the dilaton dependence is restricted only to the following type of additive terms u u , u IAI and u IBI, where arbitrarily high powers of transverse laplacian are allowed to act on IAI and or IBI. This implies, , , , , where the dilaton is identified up to an additive constant. Given these equations we shall now onwards work with the variables huu, AI, BI and on the CSFT side. One would therefore expect the CSFT equations of motion to include the first two equations in in the same form and

Chunk: euv u, x , euI u, x , eIJ u, x , u, x . A.2 The lagrangian density in , once computed by restricting the fluctuations to the universal sector, takes the following form u,x U u, x , A.3 where U u, x is a sum of terms of the following generic form U u, x q G u, x G 1 1G 2 2 G n n 1 1 2 2 n n , u, x G 1 1G 2 2 G n n 1 1 2 2 n n , A.4 where G u, x det G and G u, x det G IJ. In general the quantity inside the square bracket contains the following three types of objects 1. derivatives some of which may act on the background inverse metric pre factors, 2. background fields in 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 3. fluctuations in A.2 . To establish or eq. we shall now argue that U u, x is universal among all the pp wave backgrounds with the same transverse space metric G IJ u, x and background dilaton u, x . It is clear from equations A.4 that this will be true if the following quantity is universal, U u, x G 1 1G 2 2 G n n 1 1 2 2 n n . A.5 In order to establish universality of U u, x we first tensorially reduce to the transverse space to get a set of tensors in the transverse space, n Mv,Mu IJK o , A.6 where Mv and Mu are the number of covariant v and u indices in respectively. Since none of the fields appearing in the expression of Mv,Mu IJK depends on v, all the Mv number of v indices are coming purely from fields and not from derivatives. Moreover since all the fields both the backgrounds and fluctuations are in the universal sector we must have Mu Mv on the right hand side of A.6 . But Mv,Mu IJK with u, x in eq. A.5 simply because the only non zero components of the background inverse metric are G Guv , Gvv , GvI , G IJ . A.7 Therefore we must have , A.8 in all terms on the right hand side of eq. A.5 . This is precisely the kind of contraction that erases the pp wave structure of the metric background so that effectively it becomes, Geff dx dx 2dudv G IJ u, x dxIdxJ , A.9 28 which is simply the flat Minkowski space when G IJ u, x IJ. The above argument shows that the functions K u, x and AI u, x in the background metric do not appear in U u, x . We shall now show that the functions BI u, x in the background flux also do not appear in U u, x . In order to do so we first notice that the facts that does not contain any derivative with respect to v, contains fields only in the universal sector together with eq. A.8 imply that every individual field appearing in contains equal number of covariant u and v indices. For any gauge invariant background flux which is null, such as the one in , such components are zero. Therefore the functions BI u, x do not appear in U u, x . Notice that the transverse derivatives14 of the background dilaton u, x do appear in . Because of this and the exponential pre factor in eq. A.3 we need to have the same dilaton profile for all those pp wave backgrounds for which the universality of the space time action is supposed to hold. We can now generalise the above argument to incorporate an arbitrary covariant action in space time. In this case any generic term in the lagrangian density, once computed on the universal sector after expanding around a generic pp wave background,

Chunk: the bosonic sector in C.5 satisfies the condition MB MB . Therefore whenever a term like DIJ U, X U I J appears in the correlation function it always increases the number of 32 U derivatives than that of V derivatives. The result is zero due to the fact that in flat space this numbers should match in order to get a non zero result. Let us now discuss the cases when MF MF . We begin with MF MF . In this case the result is zero, matching with the flat space result, simply because there are not enough number of v v operators to contract with all the u u operators. When MF MF the fermionic interaction terms could become important as the extra number of v u operators can now be contracted with these terms. But since in this case we must have MB MB , and all the bosonic operators in the fermionic interaction terms are in the universal sector, the result is zero, again matching with the flat space result, as there are not enough number of V derivatives to contract all the existing U derivatives. This establishes that the correlators in C.5 are same as that evaluated in flat background. D Correlators in Non Constant Dilaton The analysis in the previous section does not go through when the CFT background contains non constant dilaton as in this case one needs to be more careful about how to treat the Fradkin Tseytlin term that couples the dilaton through the world sheet curvature. In this appendix we shall discuss this issue and establish eq. . We start with the pre gauge fixed path integral, Dg Vdiff W eyl e S , D.1 where the sigma model action is, Z d2 g g G X io g B X ! X X SF T , SF Z d2 g R X , D.2 where o . Choosing the conformal gauge gab e2 ab , D.3 and introducing the diffeomorphism ghosts one arrives at , where b, c ghost path integral and e S is the matter part of our interest. The matter action in conformal gauge turns out to be, , D.4 33 where Spp corresponds to the lagrangian density in . Once the condition of Weyl invariance is satisfied by choosing the background to be on shell the conformal factor can, in principle, be eliminated from the path integral relevant to the computation of any correlation function. However the effect of the Fradkin Tseytlin term16, SF Z d2 a a X , 1 Z d2z X , D.5 has to be computed with an appropriate choice of . Nevertheless the final result should be independent of this choice. Here our goal is to study the effect of this term on a correlation function involving operators inside the universal sector in an exact pp wave background with nontrivial dilaton u . Below we first recall what happens for the constant dilaton and then we generalise the method to incorporate non constant dilaton profile of our interest. As it is well known, for constant dilaton c, D.5 can be computed explicitly by choosing a particular coordinate system on the sphere. For example A 1 z z 2 dzd A 1 w w 2 dwd w , , D.6 where A is a constant determining the radius of the sphere and z, z is the local coordinate system around the in state at whereas w, w patches around the out state at . These coordinate systems correspond to choosing ln A ln 1 z z ln A ln w w 1 w w . D.7 Converting the integration in eq. D.5 into a line integral in w, w system one gets, SF I C dw 1 w 1 w w , D.8 where C is a circle around the point . This gives SF , which is the correct

Chunk: are at most quadratic and those in eqs. E.11 are at most linear in the massless fields. Let us begin with TGT. The residual gauge transformation is parameterised by res res res , where res has been given above eq. E.3 . Since res has to be linear in res and at least linear in the massless fields, there is no way to construct this. Also the field redefinition relating buI and buI is trivial in this case. Therefore the first equation in E.10 reduces to, res u , u . E.12 However, for GCT the residual transformation parameter res res res u, v, I , where res is given above eq. E.5 , can take the following form u u, x u u, x L I u u, x I u , , I , E.13 where LuI is linear in AI and or BI but may contain arbitrarily high powers of trans verse laplacian.

This shows that the transformations in E.14 are at most quadratic in massless fields. Therefore to verify this in CSFT one needs to compute the right hand side of E.8 up to at most . However, it was pointed out in that a certain trivial symmetry of the CSFT action needs to be considered in addition to the pure gauge transformation in E.8 in order to realise TGT and GCT of the EFT completely at higher order. Therefore the transformations in E.14 may not be obtained entirely from E.8 . It would be interesting to understand this explicitly through CSFT computations. 40

Chunk: pp wave backgrounds with same transverse space metric G IJ u, x and background scalars, then, L US u, x L US u, x . In particular, if corresponds to a flat transverse space with all the background scalars set to zero or a non zero constant for the dilaton , then L US u, x will take the same value as in flat space Lflat US u, x . We shall now specify what the universal sector US u, x is. First tensorially reduce a generic element v, u, x of the set v, u, x to the transverse space. It will be decomposed into a set of fields Mv,Mu IJK v, u, x , where Mv and Mu are the numbers of covariant v and u indices respectively. Then US u, x is given by the set of all possible fields Mv,Mu IJK u, x , independent of v, such that Mu Mv. US u, x n Mv,Mu IJK u, x Mu Mv o . Notice that the deformations of flat background that correspond to pp wave backgrounds 2.1, 2.2 themselves are contained in the universal sector. We prove the universality theorem or eq. for the tensorial fields in appendix A. Notice that while defining US in we did not commit to any specific form of the space time action. This automatically raises the question whether the universal sector is invariant under field redefinition or not. If we have two sets of space time fields v, u, x and v, u, x related by a field redefinition, then a generic element in v, u, x can be written as, v, u, x f v, u, x , where the right hand side represents a generic field redefinition involving fields inside v, u, x and their derivatives. The question is if we restrict the fields on the right hand side to be inside the universal sector US u, x then whether the field on the left hand 9 side is necessarily inside US u, x or not. We have argued in appendix B that the answer is indeed yes. We shall end this section with some comments about the symmetries. Certainly the isometries of the transverse space are preserved by the universal sector. But the Lorentz transformation generated by Luv, which is not a symmetry of any of the pp wave back grounds, appears to be a symmetry of the universal sector see also when the trans verse space metric is independent of u. This transformation scales u and v equally in the opposite way and therefore scales the functions K u, x and AI u, x while preserving the pp wave structure of the background. But since the universal sector is insensitive to such components of the metric the transformation remains a symmetry within this sector7. The Lorentz transformation generated by LvI does not preserve the pp wave structure, though it takes the universal sector to itself. The transformation generated by LuI preserves the pp wave structure, but it takes the universal sector to outside. 3 Universality on World Sheet Our discussion in the previous section has been general and applicable to any covariant field theory in space time expanded around a pp wave background. In this section we shall study the universality property in the context of string theory from the world sheet point of view. In order to do so we shall consider exact pp waves that are given by the ansatz in 2.1, 2.2 with the further restriction that the transverse space is flat and the background dilaton is independent of transverse directions G IJ u, x IJ , u . For the analysis in this section the transverse space will play the role of a spectator and therefore any G IJ u, x which corresponds to an on shell background can be incorporated. We restrict it to flat space merely to simplify our presentation.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0086v2 math.PR 17 Jun 2008 The Annals of Applied Probability 2008, Vol. 18, No. 3, 1026 1058 DOI 10.1214 07 AAP481 c Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2008 CLUSTERING IN A STOCHASTIC MODEL OF ONE DIMENSIONAL GAS By Vladislav V. Vysotsky1 St. Petersburg State University We give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model of one dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of n identical particles that are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds. Particles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When particles collide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass and speed are defined by the laws of conservation. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of Kn t as n , where Kn t denotes the number of clusters at time t in the system with n initial particles. Our main result is a functional limit theorem for Kn t . Its proof is based on the discovered localization property of the aggregation process, which states that the behavior of each particle is essentially defined by the motion of neighbor particles. 1. Introduction. 1.1. Description of the model. We give a quantitative analysis of clus tering in a stochastic model of one dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of n point particles, each one of mass 1 n. These particles are ran domly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds. Particles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When two or more particles collide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass and speed are defined by the laws of mass and momentum conservation. Between collisions, particles move according to the laws of Newtonian mechanics. We suppose that the force of mutual attraction does not depend on dis tance and equals the product of masses. This assumption is natural for Received March 2007 revised September 2007. 1Supported in part by the Grants NSh 4222.2006.1 and DFG RFBR 436 RUS 113 773 0 1 R . AMS 2000 subject classifications.

This reprint differs from the original in pagination and typographic detail. 1 2 V. V. VYSOTSKY one dimensional models because, by the Gauss law applied to flux of the gravitational field, gravitation is proportional to the distance to the power one minus dimension of the space. At any moment, the acceleration of a particle is thus equal to difference of masses located to the right and to the left of the particle. Random initial positions of particles are usually described see by the following natural models in the uniform model, n particles are independently and uniformly spread on in the Poisson model, particles are located at points 1 nS1, 1 nS2,..., 1 nSn, where Si is a standard exponential random walk. In other words, particles are located at points of first n jumps of a Poisson process with intensity n. These two models are the most natural and interesting let us call them the main models of initial positions. However, we will see that behavior of the Poisson model is essentially defined by independence of initial dis tances between particles rather than by the particular type of the distances distribution. Therefore, it is of a great mathematical interest to general ize the Poisson model by introducing the i.d. model, where i.d. stands for independent distances, as follows. Particles are initially located at 1 nS1, 1 nS2,..., 1 nSn, where Si is a positive random walk whose nonnegative i.i.d. increments Xi satisfy the normalization condition . Note that if we proceed in our model by a kind of duality and consider 1n Sk, k=1,2,...,n Sni,n X i nS k , then we obtain the uniform model. In our paper we will investigate both models. Thus, the main i.d. model is a continuous analogue of the dis tribution of positions of particles in the uniform and Poisson models of initial positions in the gas model. We will use a standard notation (Xn)n n1 Z . If we denote by X k n X1 nX2...Xkn+1 nXk+1 n+1, then by the definition of a random walk, X k n X,k+1 n+1 is uniformly distributed on the interval between X1 n and X n+1 and independent of X i n for i i; k. Therefore, the increments of logarithms 11 log(Xn) are independent and identically distributed, iid. Note that if we do not use the property of normalization, i.e., 1nX k n n1 E Log(X1 n), that would be a random walk with drift. We suppose in this paper that (Xn)

In fact, using the formula for we have r Z r 0 Z s u 2 du u2 t2 1g t dt du ds.

Chunk: of incidence Fig.2 . For the samples used the value of the angle was chosen experimentally for achieving of the maximal value of the luminescence it worth to mention that this value differed from 0 and was about 400 . Easier the effect was excited in the unprocessed samples. In Fig.5 one can see the luminescence of the crystals situated at the distance of about 1 centimeter from the crystal which was irradiated. Fig.7 Visible luminiscence of the opal crystals in the case of the irradiating one of them the irradiated crystal can be seen by bright red light on the left picture it was the crystal in the center, on the right picture it was the crystal on the left . Left picture corresponds to the case where crystals are infiltrated by acetone. Right picture corresponds to the case of the opal crystals without infiltration. In the case of the large laser energy several times more the threshold or if the crystal was irradiated by several laser pulses the opal can be destroyed and the parts of the crystal produce the luminiscence with the spectral and temporal properties described above Fig.8 . Fig.8 Opal crystal is destroyed and 3 large pieces and several little pieces are going on to produce the luminescence. In order to clarify the role of the Cu plate surface on the energy transport between the crystals the next experiment was realized the pure opal matrix posed on the Cu plate was irradiated by the ruby laser pulse and demonstrated strong luminescence lasting few seconds with the properties described above Fig.9 Fig.9 Luminiscence of the single opal matrix Next step was covering the surface of the Cu plate with the liquid experiments were made with water, aceton or ethanol . The thickness of the frozen liquid on the plate surface was about 1 mm. The transverse size of the frozen liquid was about 1 cm. After illuminating of the crystal by the ruby laser pulse the luminiscence of the crystal appears the bright blue luminiscence of the frozen species of the liquid used appears. The temporal characteristics of the luminiscence in crystal and in the frozen liquid are approximatly the same the luminiscence duration is about several seconds . The luminiscence of the frozen liquid goes on in spite on the putting the screen between the crystal and the liquid. It shows that the luminiscence of the liquid is not a reflection of the light which is emmited by the crystal. Fig.10 shows the luminiscence of the crystal and the frozen liquid in this case it was water . The pictures were made with the interval of 1 second between each other. Analogous behaviour is demonstrated by aceton and ethanol. The luminiscence of the area covered with frozen liquid takes place even if this area is at the distance of several cantimeters from the irradiated crystal.The explanation of the blue luminiscence of the frozen liquid can be done in several ways and for clarifying the reasons of this luminescence appearance it is necessary to produce additional experiments. The intensity of the laser in the experiments is about 0.12 Gw cm2, and the large enhancement of this field due to Mie resonance simultaniously with the interference effect caused by the structure of the opal matrix can lead to the extremely large field enhancement which can play an important role in this effect.

In this paper we reported about some new features of the photonic flame effect.

Chunk: ux y uy . Without loss of generality, we further consider a case with equal channels which are subject to mutually independent random disturbances that do not depend on u. In such cases, the central limit theorem of probability theory, as well as the maximum entropy principle, suggest that we express the SF of a particular channel by the Gaussian function g x ux, 1 2 exp x ux 2 2 The parameters ux, represent the mean value and standard deviation of signal x at the cal ibration and can be statistically estimated from given data. The joint SF is then determined by the product z u g x ux, g y uy, . When reporting experimental results, experimentalists most often only specify mean val ues and standard deviations of variables during calibration. The maximum entropy principle 4 tells us that, in such cases, the Gaussian function is the best choice for SF . B. Nonparametric estimation of PDF pertaining to experimental data When we perform a single measurement, we get a sample x1, y1 that represents the mean value of z during measurement and, therefore, we express the PDF as z z1 x x1 y y1 . When we repeat the measurements N times, we get a set of samples , by which we model the joint PDF by the statistical average f z 1 N N X z zi that represents the kernel estimator. Properties of the particular components x, y are described by the marginal PDFs f x , f y . They are obtained from the joint PDF by integration with respect to one com ponent, for example f x Z Sy f z 1 x xi . For modeling natural laws, the most important is the conditional PDF of the variable y at a given value of x, defined as f y x f z f x PN z zi PN x xj C. Estimation of a physical law Distributions of joint experimental data, for example that shown in Fig. 1, often resemble a ridge along some hypothetical line yo x , which we want to extract from the given data in an optimal way. For this purpose, we select from a set of joint data only those that pertain to some selected x. These joint data generally exhibit various values of y which we try to represent by a single value called the predictor of the variable y from a given value x. We consider as an optimal predictor of the hypothetical yo the value yp at which the mean square prediction error is minimal E yp y 2 x min yp . 5 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 X Y PDF FIG. 1 The joint PDF f z utilized to demonstrate the properties of the conditional average estimator.

Chunk: a property of an intelligence. Therefore, the estimator yp x could be treated as a basis for the development of a machine intelligence based on modeling of natural laws. The 6 conditional average given in Eq. 7 in fact corresponds to a normalized radial basis function neural network which is equivalent to a multilayer perceptron the basic paradigm used in the theory of artificial neural networks . III. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MODEL A. Predictor quality A predictor maps the stochastic variable x to a new stochastic variable yp that gener ally differs from the variable y. When the variables x, y are related by some hypothetical physical law yo x and the measurement noise is small, the first and second statistical mo ments E y yp , E y yp 2 of the prediction error are also small. The second moment is E y yp 2 Var y Var yp 2Cov y, yp m y m yp 2, where E, m, Var, Cov denote statistical average, mean value, variance and covariance respectively. In the case of statistically independent variables y and yp with equal mean values, the last two terms are zero and we get E y yp 2 Var y Var yp . With respect to this relation, we define the predictor quality relatively by the formula y yp 2 Var y Var yp 2Cov y, yp Var y Var yp m y m yp 2 Var y Var yp The quality is 1 if the prediction is exact , while it is 0 if y and yp are statistically independent and have equal mean values. The quality Q may be negative if m y m yp . For the predictor defined by the conditional average yp x R y f y x dy, we analytically obtain the equalities m y m yp and Cov y, yp Var yp , which yield yp Var y Var yp . From the definition of the conditional average, it follows 0 Var yp Var y and therefore 0 Q 1. This inequality need not be fulfilled exactly if CA is statistically estimated from a finite number of samples. With an increasing N, we generally expect that the CA statistically estimated by Eq. increasingly better represents the governing physical law and, consequently, that the corre sponding predictor quality Q on average increases to a certain limit value. As mentioned 7 previously, an unlimited increase in the number of experiments is experimentally impossible and, consequently, there arises the question how to determine a proper number No of data that will yield a judicious estimation of the governing law. B. Redundancy and predictor cost function To answer the last question, we have analyzed various experimental cases which have shown us that, with an increasing number of experimental samples, the value of predictor quality generally stabilizes when the distance between data points becomes similar to the width of the scattering function. Therefore, it is not reasonable to surpass significantly the corresponding number of data. This can be achieved if a ratio of and a proper measure of distance between neighbor data points is considered. For this purpose, we introduce over the mean value of minimum square distance between data points min . . . N, . . .N, , and define a measure of redundancy of data by the relative variable 2 2 Since 2 is comprised of two terms denoting contributions from x and y components, a factor 2 is utilized in the nominator. The fraction 2 2 2 represents an average increase of redundancy that is assigned to the acquisition of a new data point. In order to take into account acquisition of N data points, factor N is further used. With respect to this, we introduce the predictor cost function by the sum 2N 2 2 E y yp 2 Var y Var yp . The constant 1 is inserted in the first

V. DISCUSSION Our method of estimation of natural laws from given data can be simply generalized to multivariate cases by substituting corresponding vectors for the variables x, y. Such modeling has already been applied in a variety of examples stemming from physical , technical , economic and medical environments . Particularly in economic and medical environments, phenomena are often characterized by many variables that could be either informative or disturbing. Due to the complexity of such cases, there usually exists little or no information about a possible function that could describe the governing law. In relation to this, researchers are faced with the problem of how to define complexity and to reduce it by extracting informative variables from a given set . Alongside mutual information, the predictor quality could also be applied for this purpose. For instance, it has been recently shown in the field of medicine how an analysis of predictor quality can provide for an ordering of variables and the extraction of a set that yields an optimal predictor of the disease healing process . Such an analysis makes feasible further progress towards the origins of the treated disease. The value of the proper number No, as defined by the minimum of predictor cost function, 14 could be interpreted as a measure of the complexity of an adequate predictor model. It is important that this measure depends only on the accuracy of observation and properties of the phenomenon represented by given experimental data. In relation to the example demonstrated here, there emerges an important conclusion about the description of natural phenomena by physical laws in the form x . As long as such a law is considered as the only basis for the description of the phenomenon, it is not sufficient for a complete description, since no information is provided about the properties of the sample space of joint data. Consider a well known example the law V that relates the mass m, the volume V and the density of an object. This law does not include the restriction m 0, and is in this aspect not complete. Similar, but much more complex, examples are met when treating chaotic phenomena and their strange attractors . For example, the law applied here is a special case of the law n n 1 n , with a being a constant. Depending on the value of a and the starting value 1, the series exhibits at large values of parameter n either a discrete or a continuous sample space. Moreover, in the continuous case, the sample space can be comprised of disconnected intervals which could hardly be predicted analytically. Similar, but still more cumbersome, is the situation if we consider chaotic processes with continuous

Chunk: parameters. Consequently, a governing law x appears incomplete for description of the phenomenon. The most outstanding deficiency is that it does not include information about the structure of the sample space corresponding to the observed phenomenon. This deficiency does not appear if we consider as a basis for modeling the probability density function and estimate it nonparametrically, directly from measured joint data. The extraction of a law that describes a relation between variables can then be generally performed by using the conditional average estimator. However, applications of simple parametrical laws, like V , are of tremendous importance for analytical sciences and we do not expect that the proposed nonparametric models could substitute for them, although they are convenient for direct applications. Consequently, the question arises of how to find a univocal link between both paradigms of modeling. 15 VI. CONCLUSIONS Our approach indicates that the objectively introduced kernel estimator provides for a nonparametric statistical modeling of a quantitatively explored phenomenon. Since no a priori information about the form of the governing physical law is required, the modeling can be automatically performed by a computer in a measurement system. The proposed predictor cost function C provides for estimating the proper number No of data needed for the modeling. Properties of the predictor cost function resemble those of information cost function , but its estimation is much more simple. The properties of the extracted model of the governing law can be quantitatively described by the predictor quality Q and redundancy R of data from which the governing law is extracted. This law represents the distribution of the variable y at a given value x by a single predicted value yp x . Such a compressed representation generally corresponds to creation of information about the explored phenomenon . This is in contrast to the loss of information caused by stochastic disturbances in signal transmission channels . If the extraction of information from observations is considered as a basis of natural intelligence , then a system capable of estimating a physical law from measured data autonomously must be treated as an intelligent unit. Such an interpretation provides a common basis for a unified treatment of experimental sciences and natural or artificial intelligence .

What are the Applications of Algorithms used for Trading in Risk Dimensions TRD in ROPS?

In the case of the ROPS methodology, it is primarily centered around the concept of developing options in reference to financial options – including aspects such as Greeks. The method was initially designed for a large-scale US Army project Future Combat Systems (FCS). The primary goal of the ROPS methodology is the establishment of real options for non-financial projects, as discussed in earlier works by Ingber. In order to achieve this goal, the ROPS methodology implements

Chunk: further described in Fig. 1. At the end of the tree at a time T T also can be a parameter , there is a total cost at each node S T , called a final strike in financial language. A final strike might also appear at any node before T due to cancellation of the Project using a particular kind of schedule alternative. Working backwards, options are calculated at time t0. Greeks functional derivatives of the option assess sensitivity to various variables, e.g., like those discussed in previous papers , but here we deliver precise numbers based on as much real world information available.

The ASA distribution can be used to develop finite range asymmetric distributions from which a value can be chosen for a given state of duration or cost. a A random binary distribution is selected for a lower than or higher than mean, using any ratio of probabilities selected by the client. Each side of the mean has its own temperature q. Here an ASA distri bution is given for .1. The range can be scaled to any finite interval and the mean placed within this range. b A uniform random distribution selects a value from 1,1 , and a normalized ASA value is read off for the given state. 3. Data The following data are used to develop Plan CPD. Each Task i has a a Projected allocated cost, Ci b a Projected time schedule, Ti c a CPD with a statistical width of funds spent, SWSi d a distribution with a statistical width of duration, SWTi e a range of durations, RTi f a range of costs, RSi Expert guesses need to be provided for c f for the prototype study. A giv en Plan must be constructed among all Tasks, specified the ordering of Tasks, e.g., obeying any sequential constraints among Tasks. 4. Three Recursive Shell 4.1. Outer Shell There may be several parameters in the Project, e.g., as coefficients of variables in means and variances of different CPD. These are optimized in an outer shell using ASA . This end product, including MULTI MIN states returned by ASA, gives the client flexibility to apply during a full Project . We may wish to minimize Cost T, or CostOverrun CostInitial T, etc. Lester Ingber 4 Real Options for Project Schedules ROPS 4.2. Middle Shell To obtain the Plan CPD, an middle shell of Monte Carlo MC states are generated from recursive calculations. A Weibull or some other asymmetric finite distribution might be used for Task durations. For a giv en state in the outer middle, a MC state has durations and mean cost disbursements defined for each Task. 4.3. Inner Shell At each time, for each Task, the differenced cost Sik t dt Sik t is subjected to a inner shell stochastic variation, e.g., some asymmetric finite distribution. The net costs dSik t for each Project i and Task k are added to define dS t for the Plan. The inner shell cost CPD is re applied many times to get a set of at each time. 5. Real Options 5.1. Plan Options After the Outer MC sampling is completed, there are histograms generated of the Plan s dS t and dS t S t dt at each time t. The histograms are normalized at each time to give P dS, t . At each time t, the data representing P is curve fit to the form of Eq. , where f and g are functions needed to get good fits, e.g., fitting coefficients of parameters ... ...

Chunk: t , which includes the prefactor containing g and the function L which may be viewed as a Pade approximate of these polynomials. Complex constraints as functions of Sik t can be easily incorporated in this approach, e.g., due to regular reviews by funding agencies or executives. These P s are input into PATHTREE to calculate options for a given strategy or Plan. 5.2. Risk Management of Project Options If some measure of risk among Projects is desired, then during the MC calculations developed for the top level Plan, sets of differenced costs for each Project, dSi t and dSi t Si t dt , stored from each of the Project s Tasks. Then, histograms and Project CPDs are developed, similar to the development of the Plan CPD. A copula analysis, coded in TRD for risk management of financial markets, are applied to develop a relative risk analysis among these projects . In such an analysis, the Project marginal CPDs are all transformed to Gaussian spaces, where it makes sense to calculate covariances and correlations. An audit trail back the original Project spaces permits analysis of risk dependent on the tails of the Project CPDs. 6. Generic Applications ROPS can be applied to any complex scheduling of tasks similar to the FCS project. The need for government agencies to plan and monitor such large projects is becoming increasingly difficult and necessary . Many large businesses have similar projects and similar requirements to manage their complex projects. Lester Ingber 5 Real Options for Project Schedules ROPS

Chunk: such that q Q z. Proof. The group Q will be constructed as a direct limit of relatively hyperbolic groups. Step 0 . Set F then G is hyperbolic relative to its subgroup H and F is a suitable subgroup of G by Lemma 2.6. Let N G be the normal closure of the subgroup in G . Evidently N and H . Enumerate all the elements of N , and of G , in such a way that 1. Steps 0 i . Assume the groups G j , , . . . , i, i 0, have been already constructed, so that 1 . for each 1 j i there is an epimorphism j 1 G j 1 G j which is injective on the image of H in G j 1 . Denote F j j 1 F j 1 , N j j 1 N j 1 2 . G j is torsion free and hyperbolic relative to the image of H, and F j G j is a suitable subgroup, , . . . , i 3 . G j H N j , N j G j and H N j M, , . . . , i 4 . the natural image gj of gj in G j belongs to F j , , . . . , i 5 . there exists zj H such that qj G j zj, , . . . , i, where qj is the image of qj in G j . Step i 1 . Let qi 1 G i , gi 1 N i be the images of qi 1 and gi 1 in G i . First we construct the group G i 1 2 , its normal subgroup Ki 1 and its element ti 1 as follows. If for some f G i , f qi 1f , then set G i 1 2 G i , Ki i G i 1 2 and ti . Otherwise, qi 1 is a hyperbolic element of infinite order in G i . Since G i is torsion free, the elementary subgroup EG i qi 1 is cyclic, thus EG i qi 1 for some h H and x N i by 3 , and qi hx m for some m Z. Now, by Lemma 2.2, G i is hyperbolic relative to . Choose y M so that hy 1 and let G i 1 2 be the following HNN extension of G i G i 1 2 G i , ti 1 ti 1 hx t 1 i . The group G i 1 2 is torsion free and hyperbolic relative to H by Lemma 2.5. Let us now verify that the subgroup F i is suitable in G i 1 2 . Indeed, according to Lemma 2.7, there are two hyperbolic elements f1, f2 F i of infinite order in G i such that fl G i hx, fl G i hy, , 2, and f1 G i f2. Then f1 G i 1 2 f2 by Lemma 3.1. It remains to check that fl is a hyperbolic element of G i 1 2 for each , 2. Choose an arbitrary element w H and observe that fl G i w since H is malnormal in G i by Lemma 2.3, a non trivial power of fl is conjugated to an element of H if and only if fl is conjugated to an element of H in G i , but the latter is impossible because fl is hyperbolic in G i . Applying Lemma 3.1 again, we get that fl G i 1 2 w for any w H. Hence f1, f2 F i are hyperbolic elements of infinite order in G i 1 2 . The intersection EG i 1 2 f1 14 ASHOT MINASYAN EG i 1 2 f2 must be

Chunk: be a collection of isolated components of q and g1, . . . , gk be the elements of G represented by Lab p1 , . . . , Lab pk respectively. Then g1, . . . , gk belong to the subgroup G and the word lengths of gi s with respect to satisfy k X gi K L q . Definition. Suppose that m N and is a finite subset of G. Define W , m to be the set of all words W over the alphabet X H that have the following form W x0h0x1h1 . . . xlhlxl 1, where l Z, l 2 if if , hi and xi are considered as single letters and 1 xi X , , . . . , l 1, and for each , . . . , l, there exists i such that hi H i 2 if i i 1 then xi 1 H i for each , . . . , l 1 3 hi , , . . . , l. Choose the finite subset G and the constant .1. Recall that a path q in G, X H is said to be without backtracking if all of its components are isolated. Lemma 6.2. Let q be a path in the Cayley graph G, X H with Lab q W , m and m 5K. Then q is without backtracking. Proof. Assume the contrary to the claim. Then one can choose a path q providing a counterexample of the smallest possible length. Thus if p1, . . . , pl is the consec utive list of all components of q then l 2, p1 and pl must be connected H components, for some , the components p2, . . . , pl 1 must be isolated, and q starts with p1 and ends with pl. Since Lab q W , m we have L q 2l 1. If X letter between p1 and p2 would belong to H contradicting the property 2 from the definition of W , m . Therefore l 3. Since p1 and pl are connected, there exists a path v in G, X H between pl and p1 with Lab v H thus we can assume that L v 1 . Denote by q the subpath of q starting with p1 and ending with pl . Note that L q L q 2 2l 3, and p2, . . . , pl 1 is the list of components of q, all of which are isolated. If one of them were connected to v it would imply that it is connected to p1 contradicting with the minimality of q. Hence the cycle qv possesses 18 ASHOT MINASYAN , which represent elements h1, . . . , hk H. Consequently, applying Lemma 6.1 one obtains that hi , , . . . , k, and k X hi K L o K L q 1 K 2l 2 . By the condition 3 from the definition of W , m one has hi m 5K for each , . . . , k. Hence k 5K k X hi K 2l 2 , or 5 2l 2 k , which contradicts the inequality k l 2. Q.e.d. Definition. Consider an arbitrary cycle q in G, X H , where Lab q and Lab q belong to W , m . Let p be a component of q or q . We will say that p is regular if it is not an isolated component of o. If m 5K, and hence q and q are without backtracking by Lemma 6.2, this means that p is either connected to some component of q respectively q , or to a component of r or r . Lemma 6.3.

Chunk: every component of q or q is regular b if C 2 then each of q and q can have at most 4C components which are not regular. c if l is the number of components of q, then at least l 6C of components of q are connected to components of q and two distinct components of q can not be connected to the same component of q . Similarly for q . Proof. Assume the contrary to a . Then one can choose a cycle q with L r , L r 1, having at least one isolated component on q or q , and such that L q L q is minimal. Clearly the latter condition implies that each component of q or q is an isolated component of o. Therefore q and q together contain k distinct isolated components of o, representing elements h1, . . . , hk H, where k 1 and k L q 1 2 L q 1 2. Applying Lemma 6.1 we obtain hi , , . . . , k, and k X hi K L o K L q L q 2 . Recall that hi m 7K by the property 3 from the definition of W , m . Therefore Pk hi k 7K, implying 7 2 k L q 2 L q 2 1 2 k L q 1 2 L q 1 2 2 6, which yields a contradiction. Let us prove b . Suppose that C 2 and q contains more than 4C isolated components of o. We shall consider two cases Case 1. No component of q is connected to a component of q . Then a com ponent of q or q can be regular only if it is connected to a component of r or r . Since, by Lemma 6.2, q and q are without backtracking, two distinct components of q or q can not be connected to the same component of r or r . Hence q and GROUPS WITH FINITELY MANY CONJUGACY CLASSES 19 q together can contain at most 2C regular components. Thus the cycle o has k isolated components, representing elements h1, . . . , hk H, where k L q 1 2 L q 1 2 2C. By Lemma 6.1, hi for each , . . . , k, and Pk hi K L q L q 2C . Once again we can use the property 3 from the definition of W , m to achieve 7 2 k L q 2 L q 2 2C 2 2 k L q 1 2 L q 1 2 2C 1 3C 2 k L q 1 2 L q 1 2 2C 2 k 6C k 2 1 2 3 , yielding a contradiction. Case 2. The path q has at least one component which is connected to a com ponent of q . Let p1, . . . , pl denote the sequence of all components of q. By part a , if ps and pt, 1 s t l, are connected to components of q , then for any j, s j t, pj is connected to some component of q because q is without back tracking by Lemma 6.2 . We can take s respectively t to be minimal respectively maximal possible. Consequently p1, . . . , ps 1, pt 1, . . . , pl will contain the set of all isolated components of o that belong to q, and none of these components will be connected to a component of q . Without loss of generality we may assume that s 1 4C . Since ps is connected to some component p of q , there exists a path v in G, X H satisfying ps , v p , Lab v H , L v 1. Let q respectively

Therefore we can apply Lemma 6.5 to find two consecutive components of q that are connected to some components of q . Due to the form of the word W a, v2 , one of the formers will have to be an EG v2 component, but q can have only EG v1 or Hi0 components. This yields a contradiction because EG v2 EG v1 and EG v2 Hi0. Hence w1 1 in G1, and the proof is complete. 8. Every group is a group of outer automorphisms of a 2CC group Lemma 8.1. There exists a word R x, y over the two letter alphabet such that every non elementary torsion free word hyperbolic group F1 has a non elemen tary torsion free word hyperbolic quotient F that is generated by two elements a, b F satisfying R a, b F 1, R a 1, b 1 , R b, a , R b 1, a 1 .

Since the symmetrization of R3 also satisfies C 1 8 , the group a, b N is a torsion free 10, Thm. V.10.1 word hyperbolic group because it has a finite presentation for which the Dehn function is linear by 10, Thm. V.4.4 such that R a, b F 1 but R a 1, b 1 b, a b 1, a 1 . 26 ASHOT MINASYAN Indeed, if the word R a, b were trivial in F then, by Greendlinger s Lemma 10, Thm. V.4.4 , it would contain more than a half of a relator from the symmetriza tion of R3 as a subword, which would contradict the fact that R2 enjoys C 1 8 . The group F is non elementary because every torsion free elementary group is cyclic, hence, abelian, but in any abelian group the relation R a 1, b 1 1 implies R a, b 1. Now, the free product F F1 is a torsion free hyperbolic group. Its subgroups F and F1 are non elementary, hence, according to a theorem of Ol shanskii 16, Thm. 2 , there exists a non elementary torsion free word hyperbolic group F and a homomorphism G F such that F F1 F and R a, b 1 in F. Therefore F is a quotient of F1, the images of the elements a, b generate F and enjoy the required relations. We are now ready to prove Theorem 1.5. Proof of Theorem 1.5. The argument will be similar to the one used to prove The orem 5.1. First, set .2 to find a countable torsion free group H and a normal subgroup M H, where H 2CC alternatively, one could start with a free group H and M H such that H M C, and then apply Lemma 4.4 to the pair H , M to obtain H and M with these properties . Consider the word R x, y and the torsion free hyperbolic group F, generated by the elements a, b F which satisfy , given by Lemma 8.1. Denote G 2 H F and let N 2 be the normal closure of in G 2 , F 2 F, R 2 a finite subset of F 2 . By Lemma 2.6, G 2 will be hyperbolic

Source: The text seems to be dealing with the construction and properties of some groups G i, G i 1, and G i 2 3, and the relationships between these groups. It also mentions some other groups and terms such as N, H, Q, F, Aut, and 2CC, which might be concepts from abstract algebra or group theory. It appears the text is trying to prove or construct certain properties or results related to these groups and their structure. So the search queries are focused on defining and understanding the properties of G i, the construction of G i 1, and understanding Q and its relation to N.

In response to the first query, the aim is to define the group G i and explain its properties. The text does not provide a direct definition of G i, but it mentions that the group G i 2 3 is torsion free and hyperbolic relative to H by Lemma 2.5. It then goes on to say that F i is a suitable subgroup of G

Chunk: classical theory of HNN extensions allows to construct different embeddings into infinitely generated groups that have finitely many classes of conjugate elements, and in Section 5 we use Osin s results from regarding quotients of relatively hyperbolic groups to prove Theorem 1.4. Let H be a torsion free countable group and let M H be a non trivial normal subgroup. Then H can be isomorphically embedded into a torsion free group Q, possessing a normal subgroup N Q, such that N and H hence Q N has 2CC x, y Q , x Q y if and only if x Q N y , where Q Q N is the natural homomorphism rank N 2 and rank Q rank H M 2. This theorem implies that if Q n 1 conjugacy classes e.g., if it is finite , then the group Q will have nCC and will not be simple if n 3 . Thus it may be used to build nCC groups in a recursive manner. It also allows to obtain embeddings of countable torsion free groups into nCC groups, which we could not get by using Corollary 1.2. For instance, as we saw in Example 1, the fundamental group of the Klein bottle G1, given by , can not be embedded into a 3CC group M so that t M t 1. However, with 4 conjugacy 4 ASHOT MINASYAN classes this is already possible see Corollary 5.5 in Section 5. The idea is as follows the group G1 can be mapped onto Z 3Z in such a way that the images of the elements t and t 1 are distinct. Let M be the kernel of this homomorphism. One can apply Theorem 1.4 to the pair G1, M to obtain the required embedding of G1 into a group Q. And since Z 3Z has exactly 3 conjugacy classes, the group Q will have 4CC . An application of Theorem 1.4 to the case when 2Z H also provides an affirmative answer to a question of A. Izosov from 9, Q. 11.42 , asking whether there exists a torsion free 3CC group Q that contains a normal subgroup N of index 2. The goal of the second part of this article is to show that every countable group can be realized as a group of outer automorphisms of some finitely generated 2CC group. This problem has some historical background in T. Matumoto proved that every group is a group of outer automorphisms of some group in contrast, there are groups, e.g., Z, that are not full automorphism groups of any group M. Droste, M. Giraudet, R. G obel showed that for every group C there exists a simple group S such that Out S C I. Bumagina and D. Wise in proved that each countable group C is isomorphic to Out N where N is a 2 generated subgroup of a countable C 1 6 group, and if, in addition, C is finitely presented then one can choose N to be residually finite. In Section 6 we establish a few useful statements regarding paths in the Cayley graph of a relatively hyperbolic group G, and apply them in Section 7 to obtain small cancellation quotients of G satisfying certain conditions. Finally, in Section 8 we prove the following Theorem 1.5. Let C be an arbitrary countable group. Then for every non elemen tary torsion free word hyperbolic group F1 there exists a torsion free group N sat isfying the following properties N is a 2 generated quotient of F1 N has 2CC Out N C. The principal difference between this theorem and the result of is that our group N is torsion free and simple. Moreover, if one applies Theorem 1.5 to the case when F1 is a torsion free hyperbolic group with Kazhdan s property T and recalls that every quotient of a group with property T also

Assume that G is a countable torsion free group, n N, n 2, and non empty subsets Xi G , , . . . , n 1, are independent in G.

Let g1, g2, . . . be an enumeration of all non trivial elements of G.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0092v2 hep lat 26 Jul 2007 Energy density for chiral lattice fermions with chemical potential Christof Gattringera and Ludovit Liptakb aInstitut f ur Physik, FB Theoretische Physik, Universit at Graz, Universit atsplatz 5, 8010 Graz, Austria bInstitute of Physics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, D ubravsk a cesta 9, 845 11 Bratislava 45, Slovak Republic We study a recently proposed formulation of overlap fermions at finite density. In particular we compute the energy density as a function of the chemical potential and the temperature. It is shown that overlap fermions with chemical potential approach the correct continuum behavior. PACS numbers 11.15.Ha, 12.38.Gc I. INTRODUCTION Over the last two decades lattice gauge theory was turned into a powerful qualitative tool for analyzing QCD. This progress is in part due to the advances in algorithms and computer technology, but also on the con ceptual side important breakthroughs were made. Most prominent among these is the correct implementation of chiral symmetry on the lattice based on the Ginsparg Wilson equation for the Dirac operator . An application of lattice techniques which has seen a lot of attention in recent years, is the study of QCD at finite temperature. The lattice implementation of the chemical potential , necessary for such an analysis, is not straightforward, however. It is well known , that a naive introduction leads to 2 a2 contributions which diverge in the continuum limit when the lattice spacing a is sent to zero. For more traditional formulations, such as the Wilson or staggered Dirac operators, the problem has been solved by introducing the chemical potential in the same way as the 4 component of the gauge field. A satisfactory implementation of the chemical poten tial should be compatible with chiral symmetry on the lattice based on the Ginsparg Wilson equation. When attempting to introduce the chemical potential into the only solution of the Ginsparg Wilson equation know in closed form, the overlap operator , a potential prob lem quickly surfaces defining the sign function of a non hermitian matrix. In Bloch and Wettig proposed a solution based on an analytic continuation of the sign function into the complex plane. It was shown, that the eigenvalue spectra of this construction match the expec tations from random matrix theory. In this letter we analyze the proposal further and study the energy density of free, massless overlap fermions with chemical potential. The dependence of the energy density on and the temperature T allows for a detailed analysis of the lattice formulation at finite den sity. Of particular interest will be the question whether the analytic continuation of the sign function produces divergent 2 a2 terms. Our study indicates the absence of such contributions and we find that the and T de pendence of the energy density is approached correctly. II. SETUP OF THE CALCULATION The overlap Dirac operator D for fermions with a chemical potential is given as D 1 a 1 5 sign H , H 5 1 aDW . The sign function may be defined through the spectral theorem for matrices. DW denotes the usual Wilson Dirac operator, DW x, x,y 3 X j 2a Uj x x j,y 1 j 2a Uj x j x j,y i 1 4 2a4 U4 x e a4 x 4,y 1 4 2a4 U4 x 4 e a4 x 4,y . For later use we distinguish between the lattice spacing a in spatial direction and the temporal lattice constant a4. Periodic boundary conditions are used in the spatial directions, while in time direction we apply anti periodic boundary conditions. The chemical potential is cou pled in the usual exponential form . For vanishing the Wilson Dirac operator is 5 hermitian, i.e., 5DW . This implies that H is a hermitian matrix. As soon as the chemical po tential is turned on, 5 hermiticity no longer holds, and H is a non hermitian, general matrix. This fact

The ar rows indicate the maximum positions of the Re where the single apparent kink in the band dispersion is usually de fined. b Summary of the doping dependence of the apparent kink energy and the apparent mode energy extracted by as suming a single mode scenario. changed for our doping dependence simulation while, a filter function, 2 2 2 sc with different value of c axis screening frequency sc is applied to the c axis phonons B1g and A1g , to simulate the doping dependent cou pling strength due to the change of the c axis screening effect13,24. We note that although this is a simplifica tion, it represents the general behavior of screening con siderations for phonons involving small in plane momen tum transfers. Full consideration of screening has been given in Ref. 17 and Ref. 24. In addition, a component 0.005 2 eV is added in the imaginary part of the self energy to mimic the quasiparticle life time broadening due to electron electron interaction. As shown in Fig. 2 a , the coupling to multiple phonon modes induces several subkinks in the dispersion. The positions of these subkinks mostly correspond to the en ergies of phonons plus the maximum d wave SC gap, 0, even through there is no gap along the nodal di rection. This is because when calculating the self energy, one needs to integrate the contributions from the entire zone, which makes the electrons in the nodal region feel the presence of the gap. Furthermore, revealed by the ex tracted real part of the self energy, Re dashed curves in Fig. 3 a , the dominant feature in Re for the OP case is induced by 36 meV B1g mode, while for the OD1 and OD2 case, the features of the 55 meV A1g mode and 70 meV breathing mode gradually out weight the con tribution from the B1g mode. This demonstrates that the change of the SC gap magnitude and the increasing screening effect to these phonons because of increased doping alters the relative strength of the subkinks caused by different modes. To simulate the experimental data, we convoluted the spectral functions shown in Fig. 2 a with a typical ARPES instrumental resolution 12.5 meV in energy res olution and 0.012 a in momentum resolution. As illus trated in Fig. 2 b and the extracted Re solid curves in Fig. 3 a , the subkinks are less obvious and become 4 a broadened single kink in the dispersion which is lo cated at roughly the energy of the dominant phonon fea ture determined by the maximum position of the Re the arrows in Fig. 3 a . The doping dependence of the kink position is summarized as the solid symbols in Fig. 3 b . Assuming a single mode scenario, one can obtain the doping dependence of the mode energy by subtracting out the SC gap size. However, we note that this extracted apparent mode energy does not match any of the modes used in the model instead, it is a av erage between the dominant features open symbols in Fig. 3 b . Clearly, since the kink energy is a sum of the superconducting gap and a spectrum of bosonic modes, it should not be taken as a precise measurement of the energy of any particular bosonic mode. This casts doubts to the analysis of the doping dependent properties of the kink in the nodal band dispersion based on the single bosonic mode coupling scenario7,8. More importantly, this illustrates the complex

Chunk: nature of lattice effects in these oxides. C. Interband Scattering Borisenko et al.8,9 observed that the scattering rate of the bonding and antibonding bands along the nodal direction cross each other near the energy of the Van Hove singularity, suggesting a strong inter band scatter ing between the bonding and antibonding bands. They argued that only a mode with odd symmetry, such as spin resonance mode, can mediate such inter band scat tering. The question whether phonons can induce such inter band scattering has also been raised by these au thors. First, we note that recent high energy and momentum resolution ARPES experiments on Bi2212 using low en ergy photons 10 eV have better resolved the bilayer splitting at the nodal point25. However, as shown in Fig. 2 of Ref. 25, the scattering rate of the bonding and anti bonding band does not exhibit a crossover behavior as reported by Borisenko at al.. The inconsistency of the data between the two groups implies that more experi ments and better analysis are needed to verify whether this inter band scattering effect is genuine. Second, empirically, it has been known for over 15 years that interband electron phonon coupling in the cuprates is very large. The evidence comes from the strong reso nance profiles of many Raman active phonons, which dis play large intensity variations26. This is generally under stood as a result of strong interband coupling, whereby phonons can be brought in and out of resonances via tun ing of the incident photon energy27. Since, in general, phonons can also provide momentum to scatter electrons along the c axis, direct inter bi layer scattering can occur which involves mixing of different symmetries of phonons. This can be viewed in a simplified way even if we first neglect direct interband scattering and consider a bilayer system coupled to c axis phonons. For , a simple classification of c axis modes is possible , , 1,2 o k c k, , ck, , 1 2 X k, t k h c k,1, ck,2, h.c. i X k,q, , 1,2, g , k, q n c k q, , ck, , a q a q h.c. o , where is the index for the electronic states of different layers, o 1 k o 2 k , t k describes the hopping of elec trons between two layers, and the index can be either gerade or ungerade active c axis modes, with symmetry classification with respect to the displacement eigenvec tors to the inversion center of the cell, depicted in Fig. 4. After diagonalizing the first two terms by canonical transformation, the electron phonon coupling can be re cast as H g,u e ,q, g g,u k, q nh a g,u q a g,u q i h c k q, , ck, , , c k q, , ck, , , i h.c. o .. We have used the c and c for the even and odd linear combination of c1 and c2, and subscript g and u for the gerade and ungerade mode, respectively. Thus for , where this classification is possible, ger ade phonons induce intra band scattering even chan nel , while the ungerade phonons mediate the inter band scattering process odd channel even without di rect electron phonon coupling across the layers. Yet for c, the classification inverts, where gerade modes become ungerade and vice versa, as illustrated in Fig 4. Thus, even in this simple case, modes at different qz con tribute both to intra and interband scattering, and the net weight of the coupling appearing in the self energy is then largely determined by the specific momentum struc ture g k, q . Since the self energy generally involves sums over qz, and coupling directly of electrons in adjacent lay ers via phonons are non negligible, clearly the inter band scattering phenomena can not be used to argue against

Chunk: results of Zn and Ni doped materials can be understood in the framework of electron phonon coupling. On the other hand, the issues that make it not plausible for the sharp kink being of spin origin, es pecially the spin resonance mode, remain i the nearly constant energy scale as a function of doping in small gap system12 ii the multiple modes12 iii the presence of clear kink in the normal state4,13,16 iv the detailed agreement between B1g phonon based explanation of the mode coupling as a function of momentum11,14, while the spin resonance with tiny spectral weight 2 is un likely to give an explanation for both nodal and antin odal renormalization v the accumulated evidence for lattice polaron effect in underdoped and deeply under doped systems35,36. With these weaknesses of the spin resonance interpretation, lattice effect is a more plausible explanation of the renormalization effects. It remains a possibility that the spin fluctuation and other strong cor relation effects are also very important to determine the 6 electronic structure of cuprates they likely contribute to a smooth renormalization of the band and may be more relevant to the higher binding energy. However, opti cal phonons are the most probable origin for the renor malization effects due to sharp modes near 40 70 meV, which is also supported by the recent finding of STM experiments37,38.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0094v1 astro ph 2 Apr 2007 Timing and Lensing of the Colliding Bullet Clusters barely enough time and gravity to accelerate the bullet HongSheng Zhao University of St Andrews, Scottish University Physics Alliances, KY16 9SS, UK We present semi analytical constraint on the amount of dark matter in the merging bullet galaxy cluster using the classical Local Group timing arguments. We consider particle orbits in potential models which fit the lensing data. Marginally consistent CDM models in Newtonian gravity are found with a total mass 1015M of Cold DM the bullet subhalo can move with , and the bullet X ray gas can move with . These are nearly the maximum speeds that are accelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even without the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of the error bars for the bullet gas speed 5000 5400 km s 1 , and the bullet gas would not be bound by the sub cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with VDM 4500 km s 1 Vgas would invoke unrealistic large amount 1015M of CDM for a cluster containing only 1014M of gas. Our results are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of 4500 km s 1 is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of Angus et al. . However, MONDian model with hot dark matter MHDM 0.6 1015M and CDM model with a halo mass 1 1015M are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data. PACS numbers 98.10. z, 98.62.Dm, 95.35. d submitted to Physical Review D, rapid publications I. POTENTIAL FROM TIMING Timing is a unique technique to establish the case for dark matter halos, first and most throughly explored in the context of the Local Group Kahn Woljter 1959, Fich Tremaine 1991, Peebles 1989, Inga Saha 1998 . In its simplest version the Local Group consists of the Milky Way and M31 as two isolated point masses, which formed close to each other, moved apart due to the Hub ble expansion, and slowed down and moved towards each other upto their present velocity 120 km s 1 and sepa ration about 700 kpc due to their mutual gravity. The age of the universe sets the upper limit on the period of this galaxy pair, hence the total mass of the pair through Kepler s 3rd law assuming Newtonian gravity. Timing also finds a timely application in the pair of merging galaxy clusters 1E0657 56 at redshift .3, which is largely an extra galactic grand analogy of the M31 MW system. The sub cluster, called the bullet , presently penetrates 400 700 kpc through the main clus ter with an apparent speed of 4750 710 550 km s 1 Marke vitch 2006 . The X ray gas of the bullet amounts to 2 1013M collides with the X ray gas of the main clus ter with the total gas up to 1014M and forms a Mach 3 cone in front of the bullet . The two clusters have at least four different centers, which are offset by 400 kpc between the pair of X ray gas centers and by 700 kpc between the pair of star light centers, which coincides with the gravitational lensing centers and dark matter potential centers Clowe et al. 2006 . The penetration speed is unusually high, hard for standard cosmology to explain statistically Hayashi White 2006 , and modi Electronic address hz4 st andrews.ac.uk fied force law has been suggested Farrar Rosen 2006, Angus et al. 2007 . The timing method applies in in MONDian gravity as well as Newtonian. Like lensing, timing is merely a method about constraining potential distribution, and is only indirectly related to the matter distribution. In this Letter we model the bullet clusters as two merging objects , and constrain the potential distribution by requiring the radial velocities of the galaxy bullets and the lensing centers to match.

Chunk: is reasonable. The method is deprojection is essentially similar to the decomoposi tion method of Bradac et al. whose explicit assumption of Einsteinian gravity is however unnecessary. The important thing here is that as far as deproject ing the above potential is concerned, no assumption is needed on the gravity theory as long as light rays fol low geodesics, a feature built in most alternative grav ity theory. Similarly orbits of massive particles are also different geodesics in these theories. The meaning of potential in such theories is that the potential scaled by a factor 2 c2 represents metric perturbations to the flat space time, especially to the g00 cdt 1 2 c2 cdt 2 term, so the Christoffel i 00 Xi , it can be shown 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 Lensing kappa 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 200 400 X kpc FIG. 2 Predicted bullet cluster convergence rescaled for sources at infinity along the line .3X cst connect ing our two potential centroids.

III. ORBITS OF THE COLLIDING CLUSTERS We now use this potential to predict the relative speed of the two clusters. This is possible using the classical timing argument, in the style of Kahn Wolter , Fich Tremaine and Voltonen et al. we postpone most rigourous least action models Pee bles 1989, Schmoldt Saha 1998 for later investiga tions since these require modeling a cosmological con stant and other mass concentrations along the orbital path of the bullet clusters, which have technical issues in non Newtonian gravity. We trace the orbits of the two centroids of the potentials according to the equation of motion d2ri ri . We assign different relative ve locities presently at .3 , and integrate backward in time and require the two centroids of the potential be close together at a time 10 Gyrs ago. The motions are primarily in the sky plane, but we allow for 600 km s relative velocity component in the line of sight. Clearly at earlier times when t is small, the two centroids are well separated compared to their sizes, so they move in the growing Keplerian potential of each other. At lat ter times the centroids came close and move in the cored 4 isothermal potential. We shall consider models with a normal truncation 10 Gyrs. We also consider models with a very large truncation C . In the language of CDM, the truncation means the virial radius of the halo. The present in stantaneous escape speed of the model can be com puted by X, Y, Z, t . We find Vesc 4200 4500 km s 1 in the central region of the shallower potential model with a present truncation 1000 kpc. The escape speed increases to Vesc 5700 km s 1 for models with a present truncation 10000 kpc. Fig. 3 shows the predicted orbits for different present relative velocities dr2 dt dr1 dt . Among models with a normal truncation, we find VDM 2950 km s 1 a model with relative velocity , while models with . Larger halo velocities are only possible in models with very large truncation. If the relative velocity is 4200 km s 4750 km s 1 between two clus ter gravity

Leach Dipartimento di Matematica e Informatica, Universit a di Perugia, 06123 Perugia, Italy Abstract In this note we present three representations of a 248 dimensional Lie algebra, namely the algebra of Lie point symmetries admitted by a system of five trivial ordinary differential equations each of order forty four, that admitted by a system of seven trivial ordinary differential equations each of order twenty eight and that admitted by one trivial ordinary differential equation of order two hundred and forty four. 1 Introduction A system of n ordinary differential equations each of order , u M u s j , t , j, , n, , M 1, has a variable number of Lie point symmetries depending upon the structure of the functions fk. The maximal dimension D of the algebra of admitted Lie point symmetries can be obtained by the formul 2 . Some explicit numbers are given in Table 1. Recently the elaboration of the elements of the Lie algebra, E8, of order 248 has been variously announced in the serious popular media. The au thoritative source is the Atlas of Lie Groups and Representations which is funded by the National Science Foundation through the American Institute of Mathematics . The results of the E8 computation were announced in a talk at MIT by David Vogan on Monday, March 19, 2007, and the details may be found at . The Atlas of Lie Groups and Representations is a project to make available information about representations of semisimple Lie groups over real and p adic fields. Of particular importance is the problem of the unitary dual, ie the classification of all of the ir reducible unitary representations of a given Lie group.

Sparse Code Division Multiple Access CDMA , a variation on the standard CDMA method in which the spreading signature matrix contains only a relatively small number of non zero elements, is presented and analysed using methods of statistical physics. The analysis provides results on the performance of maximum likelihood decoding for sparse spreading codes in the large system limit. We present results for both cases of regular and irregular spreading matrices for the binary additive white Gaussian noise channel BIAWGN with a comparison to the canonical dense random spreading code.

Background The area of multiuser communications is one of great interest from both theoretical and engineering perspectives . Code Division Multiple Access CDMA is a particular method for allowing multiple users to access channel resources in an efficient and robust manner, and plays an important role in the current preferred standards for allocating channel resources in wireless communications. CDMA utilises channel resources highly efficiently by allowing many users to transmit on much of the bandwidth simultaneously, each transmission being encoded with a user specific signature code. Disentangling the information in the channel is possible by using the properties of these codes and much of the focus in CDMA research is on developing efficient codes and decoding methods. In this paper we study a variant of the original method, sparse CDMA, where the spreading matrix contains only a relatively small number of non zero elements as was originally studied and motivated in . While the straightforward application of sparse CDMA techniques to uplink multiple access communication is rather limited, as it is difficult to synchronise the sparse transmissions from the various users, the method can be highly useful for frequency and time hopping. In frequency hopping code division multiple access FH CDMA , one repeatedly switches frequencies during radio transmission, often to minimize the effectiveness of interception or jamming of telecommunications. At any given time step, each user occupies a small finite number of the infinite M ary frequency shift keying MFSK chip carrier pairs with gain G, the total number of chip frequency pairs is MG. Hops between available frequencies can be either random or preplanned and take place after the transmission of data on a narrow frequency band. In time hopping TH CDMA, a pseudo noise sequence defines the transmission moment for the various users, which can be viewed as sparse CDMA when used in an ultra wideband impulse communication system. In this case the sparse time hopping sequences reduces collisions between transmissions. This study follows the seminal paper of Tanaka , and other recent extensions , in utilising the replica analysis for randomly spread CDMA with discrete inputs, which established many of the properties of random densely spread CDMA with respect to several different detectors including Maximum A Posteriori MAP , Marginal Posterior Maximiser MPM and minimum mean square error MMSE . Sparsely spread CDMA differs from the conventional CDMA, based on dense spreading sequences, in that any user only transmits to a small number of chips by comparison to transmission on all chips in the case of dense CDMA . The sparse nature of this model facilitates the use of methods from statistical physics of dilute disordered systems for studying the properties of typical cases. The feasibility of sparse CDMA for transmitting information was recently demonstrated for the case of real Gaussian distributed input symbols by employing a Gaussian effective medium approximation several results have been reported for the case of random transmission patterns. In a separate recent study, based on the belief propagation inference algorithm and a binary input

Sparse Code Division Multiple Access CDMA , a variation on the standard CDMA method in which the spreading signature matrix contains only a relatively small number of non zero elements, is presented and analysed using methods of statistical physics.

Chunk: entropy can be identified when the measured spectral efficiency exceeds the load, and thermodynamic transition points correspond to points of coincident spectral efficiency. Figure 2 demonstrates some general properties of the regular ensemble in which the variable and factor degree connectivities are C 3, respectively. Equations 23a 23c were iterated using population dynamics and the relevant properties were calculated using the obtained solutions the data presented is averaged over 100 runs and error bars, which are typically small, are omitted for brevity. Figure 2 a shows the bit error rate in regular and Poissonian codes, the inset focuses on the range where the sparse regular and dense cases crossover. The sparse codes demonstrate similar trends to the dense case except the irregular code, which show weaker performance in general, and in particular at high PSD. Detailed trends can be seen in figure 2 b that shows the multiuser efficiency. Codes with regular user connectivity show superior performance with respect to the dense case at low PSD. Figure 2 c shows similar trends in the spectral efficiency and mutual information shown in the inset the effect of the disconnected user component is clear in the fact that the irregular code fails to reach capacity at high noise levels. In general it appears the chip connectivity distribution is not critical in changing the trends present, unlike the user connectivity distribution. It was found in these cases and all cases with unique solutions for given PSD , that the algorithm converged to non negative entropy values and to a stability measure fluctuating about a value less than 0, as shown in figure 2 d . These points would indicate the suitability of the RS assumption. This figure has been modified from the published version, the difference being that the Poissonian chip connectivity codes have everywhere weaker performance than the dense and sparse regular code ensemble. Sparsely spread CDMA a statistical mechanics based analysis 16 The outperformance of dense codes by sparse ensembles with regular user connectivity in the low PSD regime is new to our knowledge, although Poissonian chip connectivity is everywhere inferior to both the dense and regular sparse codes. The difference between codes disappears rapidly with increasing connection density at fixed figure 3 . This is inline with our prediction of the regular code being a high performance ensemble in preceeding sections. Figure 3 indicates the effect of increasing density at fixed in the case of the regular code. As density is increased the statistics of the sparse codes approach that of the dense channel in all ensembles tested. For the irregular ensemble performance increases monotonically with density at all PSD. The rapid convergence to the dense case performance was elsewhere observed for partly regular ensembles, and ensembles based on a Gaussian prior input . At all densities for which single solutions were found the RS assumption appeared validated in the stability parameter and entropy. Figure 4 indicates the effect of channel load on performance. We first explain results for codes in which only a single solution was found no solution coexistence . For small values of the load a monotonic increase in the bit error rate, and capacity are observed as is increased with C constant, as shown in figures 4 a and 4 b , respectively. This matches the trend in the dense case, the dense code becoming superior in performance to the sparse codes as PSD increases. We found that for all sparse ensembles there existed regimes with 1.49 for which only a single stable solution existed, although the equivalent dense systems are known to have two stable solutions in some range of PSD . In all single valued regimes we observed positive entropy, and a negative stability parameter. However, in cases of large many features became more pronounced close to the dense case solution coexistence regime notably the cusp in the stability parameter, gap between MI and

Beyond this point different initial conditions give rise to one of two solutions. c The stability parameter was found to be negative for all convergent solutions, indicating the suitability of RS. Where the solution is near ferromagnetic the stability measure becomes quickly very noisy as shown for the 5 3 and 6 3 codes . d As load is increased there is a monotonic increase in capacity. The spectral efficiency for the bad solution exceeds 2 in a small interval equivalent to negative entropy , similar to the behaviour reported for the dense case. Sparsely spread CDMA a statistical mechanics based analysis 20 vertical dotted line. The dashed lines correspond to a similar behaviour observed in the dense case the range of interest is magnified in the inset. A cross over in the entropy of the two distinct solutions, near PSD 11dB, is indicative of a second order phase transition. As in the dense case, only the solution of smallest spectral efficiency is thermodynamically relevant at a given PSD, although the other is likely to be important in decoding dynamics. The trends in the sparse case follow the dense case qualitatively, with the good solution having performance only slightly worse than the corresponding solution in the dense case and vice versa for the bad solution . The entropy of the bad solution becomes negative in a small interval spectral efficiency exceeds 2 although no local instability is observed. The static and dynamic properties of the histograms appear to be well resolved in this region. However, the negative entropy indicates an instability towards either a type of solution not captured within the RS assumption, or towards some metastable configuration. We will not speculate further, the bad solution is in any case thermodynamically subdominant in its low and negative entropy form. Our hypothesis is therefore that the trends in the sparse ensembles match those in the dense ensembles within the coexistence region and RS continues to be valid for each of two distinct positive entropy solutions. The coexistence region for the sparse codes is however smaller than in the corresponding dense ensembles. Since our histogram updates mirror the properties of a belief propagation algorithm on a random graph we can suspect that the bad solution may have implications for the performance of belief propagation decoding in the coexistence region, and that convergence problems will appear near this region. In the user regular codes investigated the bad solution of the sparse ensemble outperforms the bad solution of the dense ensemble, and vice versa for the good solution. Thus regardless of whether sparse decoding performance is good or bad, the dynamical transition point for the dense ensemble would corresponds to a PSD beyond which dense CDMA outperforms sparse CDMA at a particular load. 4.2. Spectral Efficiency Lower Bound Numerical Results Finally we present figure 5, which shows the the mutual information between a single chip and transmitted bits for sparse ensembles of differing chip connectivity in the infinite PSD zero noise limit . This shows that in expectation a chip drawn from the regular ensemble contains more information on the transmitted bits than a chip drawn from any other ensemble including the Poissonian ensemble . The difference between the regular and Poissonian ensembles becomes relatively smaller as L increases. This appears consistent with the replica method results found at high PSD, although regular chip connectivity under performed by comparison with Poisson distributed chip connectivity in the low PSD regime, which was not anticipated by the single chip approximation.

A PSD limit to the expected mutual information between a single chip, and the transmitted bits. Mutual Information is highest for regular chip connectivities, with the Poissonian chip connectivity result also shown, the discrepancy becoming relatively small as L increases. The inset shows the mutual information bit decoded L on a log log plot to demonstrate an asymptotic power law behaviour and show more detail in the cases of small L. 5. Concluding Remarks Our results demonstrate the feasibility of sparse regular codes for use in CDMA. At moderate PSD it seems the performance of sparse regular codes may be very good. With the replica symmetric assumption apparently valid at practical PSD it is likely that fast algorithms based on belief propagation may be very successful in achieving the theoretical results. Furthermore for lower density sparse codes the problem of the coexistence regime, which limits the performance of practical decoding methods, seems to be less pervasive than for dense ensembles in the over saturated regime. A direct evaluation of the properties of belief propagation may prove similar results to those shown here. In the absence of replica symmetry breaking states it is normally true that belief propagation performs very well. However, to make best use of the channel resources it may be preferable to implement high load regimes in cases of high PSD, and so overcoming the algorithmic problems arising from the solution coexistence is a challenge of practical importance in this case. Other practical issues in implementation are certainly significant. Similar to the case of dense CDMA there are considerable problems relating to multipath, fading and power control, in fact it is known that these effects are more disruptive for the sparse codes, especially regular codes. However, certain situations such as broadcasting one to many channels and downlink CDMA, where synchronisation can be assumed, may be practical points for future implementation. There are practical advantages of the sparse case over dense and orthogonal codes in some regimes. The sparse CDMA method is likely to be particularly useful in frequency hopping and time hopping code division multiple access FH and TH CDMA applications where the effect of these practical limitations is less Sparsely spread CDMA a statistical mechanics based analysis 22 emphasised. Extensions based on our method to cases without power control or synchronisation have been attempted and are quite difficult. A consideration of priors on the inputs, in particular the effects when sparse CDMA is combined with some encoding method may also be interesting.

Chunk: the theoretical performance of optimal detectors. 2. The model We consider a standard model of CDMA consisting of K users transmitting in a bit interval of N chips. We assume a model with perfect power control and synchronisation, and consider only the single bit interval. In our case the received signal y is described by 1 skbk , where the vector components describe the values for distinct chips sk is the spreading code for user k, 1 is the bit sent by user k binary input symbols and the noise vector. Appropriate normalisation of the power is through the definition of the signature matrix s . It is possible to include a user or chip specific amplitude variation, which may be due to fading or imperfect power control. We consider a model without these effects. The spreading codes are sparse so that in expectation only C of the elements in vector sk are non zero. If, with knowledge of the signature matrix in use, we assume the signal has been subject to additive white Gaussian channel noise of variance 2 0 , where 2 0 is the variance of the true channel noise , we can write the posterior for the transmitted bits unknowns given the particular instance using Bayes Theorem P y N Y 1 2 2 exp 2 2 0 K X s k bk k !2 P , and from this define bit error rate, mutual information, and other quantities. The statistical mechanics approach from here is to define a Hamiltonian and partition Sparsely spread CDMA a statistical mechanics based analysis 5 function from which the various statistics relating to this probability distribution may be determined and hence all the usual information theory measures. A suitable choice for the Hamiltonian is H N X 1 1 2 2 0 K X s k bk k !2 K X k . We can here identify as the dynamical variables in the inference problem dependence shown explicitly . The other quenched variables parameters , describing the instance of the disorder, are the signature matrix s , noise and the inputs b . The variables hk describe our prior beliefs about the inputs the specific user bias , and we can assume some simple distribution for this such as all users having the same bias . Maximal rate transmission corresponds to unbiased bits , and this is considered throughout the paper. The properties of such a system may be reflected in a factor Tanner graph, a bipartite graph in which users and chips are represented by nodes see figure 1 . The calculation we undertake is specific to the case of the thermodynamic limit in which the number of chips N whilst the load K N is fixed. Note that is termed in many CDMA papers, here we reserve to mean the inverse temperature in a statistical mechanics sense which defines our prior belief for the noise level and give rise to the corresponding MAP detector. In all ensembles we may identify the parameter L as the mean number of contributions to each chip, and C as the mean number of contributions per user. As such the following also holds K . The case in which is greater than 1 will be called oversaturated, since more than one bit is being transmitted per chip. The calculations presented henceforth are specific to the case of memoryless noise, drawn from a single distribution of mean zero and mean square 2 0 P .

C C X s k 0 C P C Y Y k P s k , where N is a normalising constant, P L is the factor degree probability distribution of mean L, P C is the variable degree probability distribution of mean C, and P s k is the marginal probability distribution which is common to all ensembles P s k 1 C N s k C N s k . The form of is then sufficient for the sparse distributions we consider in the large system limit, and makes explicit the chip and user connectivity properties of the ensembles. The gain factor , is drawn randomly from a single distribution with zero measure at 0, and finite moments, in any instance of a code P s s k 0 . Unlike the dense case the details of this distribution will effect results, but only in a small way for reasonable choices . We here investigate the case of Binary Phase Shift Keying BPSK which corresponds to a uniform distribution on 1 L, 1 L , though the analytic results presented are applicable to any distribution of mean . Note that disorder in the gain factors is not a necessity, the case 1 L also allows decoding in sparse ensembles. The case where P L and P C are Poissonian distributed identifies the irregular ensemble where the connections between chips and users are independently distributed. The second distribution called partly regular has P C C, C, in which the chip connectivity is again Poisson distributed with mean L, but each user contributes to exactly C chips. This prevents the systematic failure inherent in the irregular ensemble since therein an extensive number of users fail to transmit on any chips. If in addition to the aforementioned constraint all chips receive exactly L contributions, P L L, L, the ensemble is called regular. Regular chip connectivity amongst other things prevents the systematic inefficiency due to leaving some chips unaccessed by any of the users. The case of Poissonian distributions is that in which there is no global control. In many engineering applications constraining users individually non Poissonian P C is practical, whereas coordination between users non Poissonian P L is difficult. The practicalities of implementing the different ensembles we consider are application specific the advantages inherent in distributing channel resources more evenly amongst users may be lost to practical implentation problems. 3. Methodology 3.1. Spectral Efficiency Lower Bound The inferiority of codes with Poissonian user connectivity has been pointed out previously e.g., in , based on the understanding that codes which leave a portion of the users Sparsely spread CDMA a statistical mechanics based analysis 7 disconnected cannot be optimal. Analogously we argue that codes with irregular chip connectivity must also be inferior in that they leave a fraction of the chips bandwidth unutilised, thus providing a motivation for considering fully regular codes. In this section we show a particular case in which the regular codes are expected to outperform any other ensemble by analysing the amount of information that can be extracted on the sent bits by consideration of only one chip in isolation of the other chips. This corresponds to a detector reconstructing bits based only on the value of a single chip, and is independent of the user connectivity. The spectral efficiency is defined as the mutual information between the received signal and reconstructed bits per chip. In considering only a single chip we have I y log2 P y P P0 ,y , where the subscript zero indicates that the true generative , rather than model , probability distribution. For brevity we consider the simplest case that the

This approach is a probabilistic one and hence more intuitive on some levels. 3.4. Population Dynamics Analysis of these equations is primarily constrained by the nature of equations 23a 23c . No exact solutions are apparent, and perturbative regimes about the ferromagnetic solution which is only a solution for zero noise are difficult to handle. Consequently we use population dynamics representing the distributions by finite populations histograms and iterating this distribution until convergence. It is hoped, and observed, that each histogram captures sufficient detail to describe the continuous Sparsely spread CDMA a statistical mechanics based analysis 12 function and the dynamics described below allow convergence towards a true solution distribution with only small corrections due to finite size effects.

Histograms approximating each function are formed x , 27a x , 27b with M sufficiently large to provide good resolution in the desired performance measures.

In the update of field xa the quenched parameters are sampled, L being the chip excess degree, and L magnetisations are randomly chosen from W, defining through 23a the update L 1 L , , Tr L , , , .

There is a strong analogy between the population dynamics algorithm and that of message passing on a particular instance of the graph.

Stability Analysis To test the stability of the obtained solutions we consider both the appearance of non negative entropy, and a stability parameter defined through a consideration of the Sparsely spread CDMA a statistical mechanics based analysis 13 fluctuation dissipation theorem. The first criteria that the entropy be non negative is based on the fact that physically viable solutions in discrete systems must have non negative entropy so that any solution found not meeting this criteria must be based on bad premises replica symmetry is a likely source. The stability parameter is defined in connection with the cavity method for spin glasses and tests local stability of the solutions. It is equivalent to testing the local stability of belief propagation equations as proposed in . A necessary condition for the stability of the RS solution is that the corresponding susceptibility does not diverge. This condition ensures that fields are not strongly correlated. The spin glass susceptibility when averaged over instances may be defined X , where d is the distance between two nodes in the factor graph, the inner average denotes the connected correlation function between these nodes, Xd describes the typical number of variables at distance d, and the outer average is over instances of the disorder self averaging part . This quantity is not divergent provided that ln h lim d X 2 c 1 di is negative, since this indicates an asympoptically exponential decrease in the terms of and hence convergence of the sum. In the thermodynamic limit the connected correlation function is dominated by a single direct path which may be decomposed as a chain of local linear susceptibilities c Y i,j xi a xb i xb i xj b , where i,j indicate the set of variables on the shortest path between nodes 0 and d in a particular instance of the graph 30a . This representation allows us to construct an estimation for numerically based on principles similar to population dynamics the directedness and fixed structure implicit in a particular problem is removed with the self averaging assumption leaving a functional description similar to 23a 23c , which may be iterated. In order to approximate the stability parameter one introduces additional positive numbers in the population dynamics histograms 27b,27a , xi and xa respectively. These new values represent the relative sizes of perturbations in each magnetisation, and are updated in parallel to 28,29 as L X j vj xa xj 2 , and with similar assignments

Chunk: along with a few other applications. 2 Preliminaries In this Section, we introduce the notations and necessary prerequisites a more detailed exposition can be found, e.g. in . We will use the abbreviations LHS and RHS for left hand side and right hand side, respectively. We denote the vector of diagonal entries of a matrix A by Diag A . We denote the absolute value by , both for scalars and for matrices. For matrices this is defined as A A A 1 2. Similarly, we denote the positive part of a real scalar or Hermitian matrix by , and define it by A A A 2. In this paper, we are mainly concerned with monotonously increasing convex and concave functions from R to R. Kosem noted in that any such function can be approximated by a sum of angle functions x 7 ax b x x0 , where a 0, and . We are also concerned with the unitarily invariant UI matrix norms, which we denote by , and which are defined in terms of the singular values j of the matrix only. We adopt the customary convention that the singular values are sorted in non increasing order 1 2 . . . d. Special cases of these norms are the operator norm , which is just equal to the largest singular value 1 , and the Ky Fan norms k , which are defined as the sum of the k largest singular values A k k X j A . The famous Ky Fan dominance theorem states that a matrix B dominates another matrix A in all UI norms if and only if it does so in all Ky Fan norms. The latter set of relations can be written as a weak majorisation relation between the vectors of singular values of A and B A w B k X j A k X j B , k. For PSD matrices, the above domination relation translates to a weak majori sation between the vectors of eigenvalues A w B . 3 Weyl s monotonicity Theorem , Corollary III.2.3 states that k A k A B , k, for Hermitian A and positive semi definite B. Here, A denotes the real vector of eigenvalues of A sorted in non increasing order. Finally, we refer the reader to Chapter 2 of for an exposition of a number of important functional analytic properties of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenspaces of a Hermitian matrix, which we will need in the proof of Propo sition 2. 3 Main Results The question we start with is about the straightforward generalisation of in equality to non negative convex functions. Question 1 For all A, B, 0, for all UI norms, and for non negative convex functions g on 0, with , does the inequality g A g B g A B hold? The answer to this question is negative, as shown by the following counterex ample. We consider the convex angle function g x x x 1 and the operator norm. For the 2 2 PSD matrices 0.9 0 0 0.6 , 0.8 0.5 0.5 0.4 , the eigenvalues of g A B are 0.65249 and 0.35249, while those of g A g B are 0.65010 and 0.48862. Thus, g A B 0.65249, which is larger than g A g B 0.65010. Under the additional restriction A B, the absolute value in the argument of g in the right hand side vanishes, leading to a simplified statement, and a second question, with better hopes for success. Introducing the , Question 2 For all B, 0, for all UI norms, and for non negative convex functions g on 0, with , does the inequality g B g B g hold? This restricted case also turns out to have a negative answer. Counterexam ples, however, were much harder to find, and required a reduction of the prob 4 lem

Chunk: defined for all positive t less than some value t0, which is the smallest positive t for which A tC has an accidental degeneracy which is what also happens at . This occurs, for instance, when C has simple eigenvalues. Indeed, by analyt icity of the eigenvalues of A tC in t, degeneracy is either accidental for isolated values of t or permanent for all values of t . Since all eigenvalues are simple for large enough t, they have to remain simple for all values of t except possibly for some isolated values, such as , in this case. Let t0 be the smallest positive such value, then A tC has simple eigenvalues for t0. We can therefore define Pk A in a unique way as the limit limt 0 Pk A tC . This is an allowed choice because of the continuity of the eigenvalues Pk k A Tr limt 0 Pk A tC A . Using the same argument as in the previous case, we obtain C A Tr limt 0 Pk A tC C . 11 Let l be the eigenvalues of A multiplicity not counted , and Ql the projec tions onto the corresponding eigenspaces of A with Q l the corresponding in clusion operators the rank of Ql equals the multiplicity of l, which we denote by ml. To obtain C A , we first construct the diagonal blocks Cl QlCQ l of size ml , then take the eigenvalues Cl in non increasing order of each block, and then concatenate the obtained sequences of eigenvalues C A C1 , . . . , Cm . If all eigenvalues of A are distinct, this reduces to the vector of diagonal elements of C in the eigenbasis of A that we encountered in case 1. For example, if A 5, 5, 3, 1 , then C A 1 C1 , 2 C1 , C33, C44 , where C11 C12 C21 C22 and all entries of C are taken in the eigenbasis of A. Let U be a unitary which, in this case, is not unique that diagonalises A as , and take the diagonal blocks Cl of UCU , as above. Each block can be diagonalised using a unitary Vl. Together with U we obtain the total basis rotation W U L l Vl . By construction, L l Vl leaves invariant, and resolves the ambiguity in U. We obtain that C A is the vector of diagonal entries of C in the basis obtained by applying the unitary W. 3. Finally, we look at the case when A tC is permanently degenerate, i.e. when it has degenerate eigenvalues for all values of t. W.l.o.g. we just have to look at t in an interval 0, t0 , where t0 is the smallest positive value for which A tC has an accidental degeneracy. Let us denote by j t the eigenvalues of A tC in non increasing order, multiplicity mj not counted, and by Pj t the projectors on the corresponding eigenspaces. In that case Pk A tC is only well defined if there is a j such that . . . mj then we have Pk A tC P1 t P2 t . . . Pj t . If there is no such j , let j be the largest integer such that . . . mj k . Thus mj 1. Then we have k X j A tC j X i t k k j 1 t Tr A tC P1 t . . . Pj t k k mj 1 Pj 1 t A tC k k mj 1 Pk mj 1 A tC 1 k k mj 1 Pk A tC . Thus, if we define k k mj 1, Pk j A tC interpolates linearly between Pk j A tC and Pk mj 1 j A tC with parameter

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0100v3 gr qc 31 Oct 2007 Topology Change of Black Holes Daisuke Ida1 and Masaru Siino2 1Department of Physics, Gakushuin University, Tokyo 171 8588, Japan. 2Department of Physics, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo 152 8550, Japan. April 1, 2007 Abstract. The topological structure of the event horizon has been investigated in terms of the Morse theory. The elementary process of topological evolution can be understood as a handle attachment. It has been found that there are certain constraints on the nature of black hole topological evolution i There are n kinds of handle attachments in n 1 dimensional black hole space times. ii Handles are further classified as either of black or white type, and only black handles appear in real black hole space times. iii The spatial section of an exterior of the black hole region is always connected. As a corollary, it is shown that the formation of a black hole with an Sn 2 S1 horizon from that with an Sn 1 horizon must be non axisymmetric in asymptotically flat space times. 1. Introduction Black holes in space times of greater than or equal to five dimensions have rich topological structure. According to the well known results of Hawking concerning the topology of black holes in four dimensional space time, the apparent horizon or the spatial section of the stationary event horizon is necessarily diffeomorphic to a 2 sphere. This follows from the fact that the total curvature, which is the integral of the intrinsic scalar curvature over the horizon, is positive under the dominant energy condition and from the Gauss Bonnet theorem. Alternative and improved proofs of Hawking s theorem have been given by several authors. However in higher dimensional space times, an apparent horizon or the spatial section of the stationary event horizon may not be a topological sphere, because the Gauss Bonnet theorem does not hold in such cases. Nevertheless, the positivity of the total curvature of the horizon still holds. This puts certain topological restrictions on the black hole topology, though they are rather weak. For example, the apparent horizon in five dimensional space time can consist of finitely many connected sums of copies of S3 and copies of S2 S1. In fact, exact solutions representing a black hole space time possessing a horizon of nonspherical topology have recently been found in five dimensional general relativity. When such black holes with nontrivial topologies are regarded as being formed in the course of gravitational collapse, questions regarding the evolution of the topology of black holes naturally arise. Our purpose here is to understand the time evolution of the topology of event horizons in a general setting. The relation between the crease set, where the event horizon is nondifferentiable, and the topology of the event horizon is studied in Refs. for four dimensional space times. In the present work, we carry out a systematic investigation and find useful rules to determine admissible processes of topological evolution for time slicing of a black hole. Our approach is to utilize the Morse theory in differential topology. The Morse theory is useful for the purpose of understanding the topology of smooth 1 2 manifolds. The basic tool used in this approach is a smooth function on a differ entiable manifold. The event horizon, however, is not a differentiable manifold but has a wedge like structure at the past endpoints of the null geodesic generators of the horizon. For this reason, we first smooth the wedge. Then, the smooth time function which is assumed to exist plays the role of the Morse function on the smoothed event horizon. According to the Morse theory, the topological evolution of the event horizon can then be decomposed into elementary processes called han dle attachments. In such a process, starting with a spherical horizon, one adds several handles, each characterized by the index of the critical points of the Morse function, which

Chunk: is an integer ranging from 0 to n the dimension of the smoothed horizon as a differentiable manifold . The purpose of the present article is to show that there are several constraints on the handle attachments for real black hole space times. 2. The Morse theory for event horizons Let M be an n 1 dimensional asymptotically flat space time. We require the existence of a global time function t M R that is smooth and has an everywhere time like and future pointing gradient. The event horizon H is defined as the boundary of the causal past of the future null infinity I . We treat the event horizon defined with respect to a single asymptotic end, unless otherwise stated. In other words, the future null infinity, I , is assumed to be connected. The black hole region B is defined as the interior region of H, specifically, as J I , and the exterior region E of the black hole region is its complement, J I . We refer to the intersection of the black hole region and the time slice t0 as the black hole B t0 B t0 at time . The exterior region at time , accordingly, written E t0 E t0 . One of most basic properties of the event horizon is that it is generated by null geodesics without future endpoints. In general, the event horizon is not smoothly imbedded into the space time manifold M, but it has a wedge like structure at the past endpoints of the null geodesic generators, where distinct null geodesic generators intersect. We call the set of past endpoints of null geodesic generators of H, from which two or more null geodesic generators emanate, the crease set S. When no crease set S exists between the time slices t2, the null geodesic generators of H naturally define a diffeomorphism B t1 B t2 . Hence, the topological evolution of a black hole can take place only when the time slice intersects the crease set S. Of course, the event horizon itself is a gauge independent object. Nevertheless, we often understand the dynamics of space time by scanning it along time slices. Thus, the topological evolution of a black hole depends on the time function. It is expected that Morse theory provides useful techniques to analyze such a process of topological evolution. Because the Morse theory is concerned with functions on smooth manifolds, we first regularize H around the crease set S. The event horizon is not necessarily smooth, even on H S, in the case that the future null infinity I has a pathological structure. Here it is assumed that H is smooth on H S. Then, small deformations of H near the crease set S will make H a smooth hypersurface eH in M, while e B t0 remains deformed in such a manner that e B t0 eH t0 holds and e B t0 remains homeomorphic to the original black hole for all t0 R. This deformation is assumed to be such that the time 3 V V VKOG 5 Figure 1. An example in which no smoothing procedure makes t e H a Morse function on eH. Here, the intersection of the crease set S of the event horizon and . function t e H, which is the restriction of t on eH, gives a Morse function on eH that has only nondegenerate critical points, where the gradient of t e H defined on eH becomes zero and where also the Hessian matrix i jt e H of t e H is nondegenerate. Though this assumption should hold for a wide class of systems, it does not always hold. Figure 1 gives an example for which no smoothing procedure makes the induced time function t e H a Morse function on eH, because the intersection of the crease set S of the event

Chunk: critical points. To determine whether a given topological change is admissible or inadmissible, it is not sufficient to consider only the intrinsic structure of the event horizon. Rather, it is required to take account of its imbedding structure relative to the space time. In a time slice, any point separate from eH belongs to either of the black hole or the exterior of the black hole region. It is useful to consider the local behavior of the black hole region or the exterior region near the critical point p. Let us call the exterior E of the black hole region simply the exterior region, for brevity. The exterior region is slightly deformed by the smoothing procedure. The deformed exterior region is denoted by eE , and the deformed exterior region at the time t by eE t eE t t e B t . The 0 handle is placed at some t t p . Such an attachment describes the emer gence of the black hole region at the critical point p and its expansion with time. The emergence of a bubble, which consists of a part of J I , in the background of the black hole region would also be described by a 0 handle attachment. This, however, never occurs, as we explain below in detail. Hence, a 0 handle attachment always describes the creation of a black hole homeomorphic to the n disk. An n handle attachment corresponds to the time reversal of a 0 handle attache ment. This process, however, never occurs in real black hole space time. An n handle is defined for t t p , which means that it terminates at the critical point p. The crease set is isolated into critical points during the course of the smoothing procedure. The gradient like vector field, which can be regarded as being tangent to the generator of the deformed event horizon eH, may have several inward con verging directions at the critical point due to this smoothing procedure, while the original null generator of the event horizon does not have an inward direction at the crease set. In the case of the n handle, all the directions become inward at the critical point. This implies that the null generators of the event horizon H must have future endpoints at the critical point, which is, of course, impossible. It is thus seen that an n handle attachment never occurs in real black hole space times. The remaining cases are handle attachments for 1 n 1. In these cases, the handle lies on either side of the critical point p both in the future p and in the past p . Then, we consider the case in which the handle exists during the sufficiently small time interval t t p , t p 0 , to understand the topological change of the black hole region at the critical point p. 8 7 Jdz 7 Figure 10. The neighborhood U of p is separated by h into the future region, U , and the past region, U . First, we introduce a coordinate system , , n in the neighborhood U of p, where t is a given function of time, and is the extension over U of the cannonical coordinate appearing in the Morse Lemma such that each curve x1, , xn const is timelike in U. We assume that U is the solid cylinder given by t t p , t p , P xi 2 . In this coordinate system, the handle h is given by the saddle surface p x1 2 x 2 x 1 2 xn 2 in U, which is an acausal set if the constant is taken sufficiently small, since h is tangent to the space like hypersurface p at p. Therefore, h separates U into two open subsets, the future and past regions U and U of U, where

Chunk: U and U are the subsets lying chronological future and past, respectively, of h U I h U. Explicitly, the future and past regions U are the regions satisfying t t p x1 2 x 2 x 1 2 xn 2 in U, respectively Fig. 10 . Because the handle is a subset of the black hole boundary eH, one of U is contained in the black hole region, e B, and the other in the exterior region, eE . However, the future region U of U is always included in the black hole region, i.e. U e B, and hence we have U eE , since the horizon is the boundary of the past set, J I . Therefore, the black hole region e B t p o U in U at the time p o just before the critical time is given by x1 2 x x 1 2 xn 2 o , which is homotopic to the 1 sphere S 1. For 1, S0 simply consists of two points. Similarly, e B t p o U just after the critical time is given by x1 2 x 2 o x 1 2 xn 2, 9 which is homotopic to the n disk. In this way, the black hole region restricted to the small neighborhood of the critical point p is initially homotopic to a sphere. Then, the internal region of the sphere is filled up at the critical time p and eventually becomes homotopically trivial. The exterior region, eE t U, in U is initially homotopic to an n disk for p o . Then, its n dimensional direction is penetrated by the black hole region at p , and thus it becomes homotopic to an n 1 sphere Sn 1 for p o . If the spurious event horizon is also taken into account, the future region U might be a subset of eE , and therefore the past region U might be a subset of e B. Then, the black hole region in the handle might be homotopic to an n disk initially and become homotopic to an n 1 sphere finally, and vice versa for the exterior region. Let us refer to such a topological change of the black hole region e B t U from a region homotopic to a sphere to a region homotopic to a disk as a black handle attachment, and that from a region homotopic to a disk to a region homotopic to the sphere as a white handle attachment. The above observation shows that only a black handle attachment occurs if a sufficiently small neighborhood of the critical point is considered. For example, a collision of black holes corresponds to a black 1 handle attachment, while the bifurcation of a black hole corresponds to a white n 1 handle attachment in the sense that the homotopy type of the exterior region eE t U changes from that of Sn 2 to that of Dn. This local argument also elucidates te reason that a black hole collision is admissible while a black hole bifurcation, which is its time reversal, is inadmissible. We also note that the effect of time reversal is to convert a black handle attachment into a white n handle attachment. It is appropriate to refer to the 0 handle attachment corresponding to the cre ation of a black hole as a black 0 handle attachment. Then, the proposition above also applies to a 0 handle attachment. 4. Connectedness of the exterior region There also exist processes that are unrealizable due to global conditions. Let us, for a moment, consider the event horizon in maximally extended Schwarzschild space time. Though we are interested in the event horizon defined with respect to a specific asymptotic end, for the purpose of explanation, we examine the event horizon defined with respect to a pair of asymptotic ends in Schwarzschild space

Chunk: equivalent to the merging of a pair of black holes, where these two black holes are connected elsewhere irrelevant. The other possibility is that it is attached from the inside such that the 1 handle pierces the black hole region. In asymptotically flat space times, only the latter includes axisymmetric configurations such that a spherical black hole is pinched out along the symmetric axis here the axisymmetric configuration is such that the space time possesses the SO n 1 isometry and the time slicing respects this symmetry. However, this latter possibility corresponds to a white 1 handle attachment, which is impossible, and only the former, which corresponds to a black 1 handle attachment, is possible. In particular, a transition from a spherical event horizon Sn 1 to a black ring horizon Sn 2 S1 in asymptotically flat space times is always non axisymmetric in the sense that such a configuration cannot possess SO n 1 symmetry Fig. 12 . While the apparent horizon must be diffeomorphic to a two sphere in four dimensional space times under the dominant energy condition, a torus event hori zon may appear, even under the dominant energy condition, via a black 1 handle attachment to the spherical horizon. More generally, an event horizon with an arbitrary number of genura may be formed by several black 1 handle attachments. The third rule is not directly determined by the local structure of the critical point. It states that the exterior region E t E t at each time is always connected under the assumption that I is connected. Thus, the possibility that there forms a bubble of the exterior region inside the black hole horizon is ruled out. It should, however, be noted that such a process is possible if I consists of several connected components. This may also be related to the topological censorship theorem. The topological censorship theorem states that all causal curves from I to I are homotopic under the null energy condition. This also forbids the formation of a bubble of the exterior region inside the black hole, because otherwise there would be two nonhomotopic causal curves from I to I , one 13 passing inside the horizon and the other outside. Our argument, however, does not depend on energy conditions.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0101v1 hep th 1 Apr 2007 The birth of string theory Paolo Di Vecchia1 Nordita, Blegdamsvej 17, 2100 Copenhagen , Denmark divecchi alf.nbi.dk Summary. In this contribution we go through the developments that in the years from 1968 to about 1974 led from the Veneziano model to the bosonic string theory. They include the construction of the N point amplitude for scalar particles, its factorization through the introduction of an infinite number of oscillators and the proof that the physical subspace was a positive definite Hilbert space. We also discuss the zero slope limit and the calculation of loop diagrams. Lastly, we describe how it finally was recognized that a quantum relativistic string theory was the theory underlying the Veneziano model. 1 Introduction The sixties was a period in which strong interacting processes were studied in detail using the newly constructed accelerators at Cern and other places. Many new hadronic states were found that appeared as resonant peaks in var ious cross sections and hadronic cross sections were measured with increasing accuracy. In general, the experimental data for strongly interacting processes were rather well understood in terms of resonance exchanges in the direct channel at low energy and by the exchange of Regge poles in the transverse channel at higher energy. Field theory that had been very successful in de scribing QED seemed useless for strong interactions given the big number of hadrons to accomodate in a Lagrangian and the strength of the pion nucleon coupling constant that did not allow perturbative calculations. The only do main in which field theoretical techniques were successfully used was current algebra. Here, assuming that strong interactions were described by an almost chiral invariant Lagrangian, that chiral symmetry was spontaneously broken and that the pion was the corresponding Goldstone boson, field theoretical methods gave rather good predictions for scattering amplitudes involving pi ons at very low energy. Going to higher energy was, however, not possible with these methods. Because of this, many people started to think that field theory was use less to describe strong interactions and tried to describe strong interacting 2 Paolo Di Vecchia processes with alternative and more phenomenological methods. The basic ingredients for describing the experimental data were at low energy the ex change of resonances in the direct channel and at higher energy the exchange of Regge poles in the transverse channel. Sum rules for strongly interacting processes were saturated in this way and one found good agreement with the experimental data that came from the newly constructed accelerators. Be cause of these successes and of the problems that field theory encountered to describe the data, it was proposed to construct directly the S matrix without passing through a Lagrangian. The S matrix was supposed to be constructed from the properties that it should satisfy, but there was no clear procedure on how to implement this construction1. The word bootstrap was often used as the way to construct the S matrix, but it did not help very much to get an S matrix for the strongly interacting processes. One of the basic ideas that led to the construction of an S matrix was that it should include resonances at low energy and at the same time give Regge behaviour at high energy. But the two contributions of the resonances and of the Regge poles should not be added because this would imply double counting. This was called Dolen, Horn and Schmidt duality . Another idea that helped in the construction of an S matrix was planar duality that was visualized by associating to a certain process a duality diagram, shown in Fig. , where each meson was described by two lines representing the quark and the antiquark. Finally, also the requirement of crossing symmetry played a very important role. Fig. 1. Duality diagram for the scattering of four mesons Starting from these ideas Veneziano was able to construct

Chunk: V z, p By introducing the variable f where A is an arbitrary constant, one can rewrite Eq. in the following form Lf, zf z V z, p d dy zf z V z, p This implies that, under an arbitrary conformal transformation z f z , generated by Lf , the vertex operator transforms as e Lf V z, p zf z e z , p z f z where the parameter is given by Z z z d f On the other hand, this equation implies dz zf z dz z f z The birth of string theory 23 that, inserted in Eq. , implies that the quantity V z, p dz is left invariant by the transformation z f z e LfV z, p dze z , p dz Let us now act with the previous conformal transformation on the state in Eq. .

This happens if the denominator in Eq. vanishes when 0, 1. This requires the following conditions lim 0 f 0 Expanding near the poinr 1 we can determine the relation between z and z near 1. We get z ze f 1 z ze f and from it we can determine the conformal factor dz f 1 z ze f 2 e f in the limit z 1. Proceeding in the same near the point 0 we get z zf e f f zf 1 e f ze f in the limit z 0. This means that Eq. becomes e Lf f f p 1,M p 1,M A choice of f that satisfies Eq.s is the following 24 Paolo Di Vecchia f n 1 that gives the following gauge operator n 1 that annihilates the state in Eq.

We write here d for the dimension of the Minkowski space, but we want to remind you that almost everybody working in a model for mesons at that time took for granted that the dimension of the space time was . As far as I remember the first paper where a dimension d 4 was introduced was Ref. where it was shown that the unitarity violating cuts in the non planar loop become poles that were consistent with unitarity if . In the last part of this section we will generalize the factorization procedure to the Shapiro Virasoro model whose N point amplitude is given in Eq. .

Chunk: an S matrix for the scattering of four mesons that, at the same time, had an infinite number of zero width resonances lying on linearly rising Regge trajectories and Regge behaviour at high energy. Veneziano originally constructed the model for the 1 For a discussion of S matrix theory see Ref.s The birth of string theory 3 process , but it was immediately extended to the scattering of four scalar particles. In the case of four identical scalar particles, the crossing symmetric scat tering amplitude found by Veneziano consists of a sum of three terms A s, t, u A s, t A s, u A t, u where A s, t s t s t Z 1 0 dxx s 1 1 x t 1 with linearly rising Regge trajectories s 0 s This was a very important property to implement in a model because it was in agreement with the experimental data in a wide range of energies. s, t and u are the Mandelstam variables p1 p2 2 , p3 p2 2 , p1 p3 2 The three terms in Eq. correspond to the three orderings of the four parti cles that are not related by a cyclic or anticyclic 2 permutation of the external legs. They correspond, respectively, to the three permutations , and of the four external legs. They have only simple pole singularities. The first one has only poles in the s and t channels, the second only in the s and u channels and the third only in the t and u channels. This property fol lows directly from the duality diagram that is associated to each inequivalent permutation of the external legs. In fact, at that time one used to associate to each of the three inequivalent permutations a duality diagram where each particle was drawn as consisting of two lines that rappresented the quark and antiquark making up a meson. Furthermore, the diagram was supposed to have only poles singularities in the planar channels which are those involving adjacent external lines. This means that, for instance, the duality diagram corresponding to the permutation has only poles in the s and t chan nels as one can see by deforming the diagram in the plane in the two possible ways shown in figure . This was a very important property of the duality diagram that makes it qualitatively different from a Feynman diagram in field theory where each diagram has only a pole in one of the three s, t and u channels and not simultaneously in two of them. If we accept the idea that each term of the sum in Eq. is described by a duality diagram, then it is clear that we 2 An anticyclic permutation corresponding, for instance, to the ordering is obtained by taking the reverse of the original ordering and then performing a cyclic permutation. 4 Paolo Di Vecchia Fig. 2. The duality diagram contains both s and t channel poles do not need to add terms corresponding to equivalent diagrams because the corresponding duality diagram is the same and has the same singularities. It is now clear that it was in some way implicit in this picture the fact that the Veneziano model corresponds to the scattering of relativistic strings. But at that time the connection was not obvious at all. The only S matrix property that the Veneziano model failed to satisfy was the unitarity of the S matrix. because it contained only zero width resonances and did not have the various cuts required by unitarity. We will see how this property will be implemented. Immediately after the formulation of the Veneziano model, Virasoro proposed another crossing symmetric four point amplitude for scalar particles that consisted of a unique piece given by A s, t, u u 2 s 2 t 2 1 u 2 1 s 2 1 t 2 where s 0

In the next section, we will discuss the loop diagrams. Also, in this case one finds that the h loop diagrams involving N external gluons reproduces in the zero slope limit the sum of the h loop diagrams with N external gluons of Yang Mills theory. We conclude this section mentioning that one can also take the zero slope limit of a scattering amplitude involving three and four gravitons obtaining agreement with what one gets from the Einstein Lagrangian of general rela tivity. This has been shown by Yoneya . 8 Loop diagrams The N point amplitude previously constructed satisfies all the axioms of S matrix theory except unitarity because its only singularities are simple poles corresponding to zero width resonances lying on the real axis of the Mandel stam variables and does not contain the various cuts required by unitarity . 15 The determination of the previous normalization factors can be found in the Appendix of Ref. . 40 Paolo Di Vecchia In order to eliminate this problem it was proposed already in the early days of dual theories to assume, in analogy with what happens for instance in pertur bative field theory, that the N point amplitude was only the lowest order the tree diagram of a perturbative expansion and, in order to implement unitar ity, it was necessary to include loop diagrams. Then, the one loop diagrams were constructed from the propagator and vertices that we have introduced in the previous sections . The planar one loop amplitude with M external particles was computed by starting from a M 2 point tree amplitude and then by sewing two external legs together after the insertion of a propagator D given in Eq. . In this way one gets Z ddP 2 d 2 2 d X where the sum over corresponds to the trace in the space of the harmonic os cillators and the integral in ddP corresponds to integrate over the momentum circulating in the loop. The previous expression for the one loop amplitude cannot be quite correct because all states of the space generated by the oscil lators in Eq. are circulating in the loop, while we know that we should include only the physical ones. This was achieved first by cancelling by hand the time and one of the space components of the harmonic oscillators reducing the degrees of freedom of each oscillator from d to d 2 as suggested by the DDF operators at least for . This procedure was then shown to be cor rect by Brink and Olive . They constructed the operator that projects over the physical states and, by inserting it in the loop, showed that the reduction of the degrees of freedom of the oscillators from d to d 2 was indeed correct. This was, at that time, the only procedure available to let only the physical states circulate in the loop because the BRST procedure was discovered a bit later also in the framework of the gauge field theories! To be more explicit let us compute the trace in Eq. adding also the Chan Paton factor. We get 2 d d M X ! NT r a1 . . . aM 8 2 d 2 N M

Chunk: appearing in the Pomeron sector have to be identified with those of the Shapiro Virasoro model. The proof that the spectrum was the same came rather early. This was obtained by factorizing the non planar dia gram in the Pomeron channel as we have done in Eq. . It was found that the states of the Pomeron channel lie on a linear Regge trajectory that has double intercept and half slope of the one of the Reggeons. This follows immediately from the propagator D in Eq. that has poles for values of the momentum of the Pomeron exchanged given by 2 2 , while the Reggeon propagator in Eq. has poles for values of momentum equal to 1 , it was still not clear that the Pomeron states interact among them selves as the states of the Shapiro Virasoro model. To show this it was first The birth of string theory 45 necessary to construct tree amplitudes containing both states of the general ized Veneziano model and of the Shapiro Virasoro model . They reduced to the amplitudes of the generalized Veneziano Shapiro Virasoro model if we have only external states of the generalized Veneziano Shapiro Virasoro model. Those amplitudes are called today disk amplitudes containing both open and closed string states. They were constructed by using for the Reggeon states the vertex operators that we have discussed in Sect. in volving one set of harmonic oscillators and for the Pomeron states the vertex operators given in Eq. that we rewrite here V , z, z, p V z, p 2 V z, p 2 because now both component vertices contain the same set of harmonic os cillators as in the generalized Veneziano model. Furthermore, each of the two vertices is separately normal ordered, but their product is nor normal ordered. The amplitude involving both kinds of states is then constructed by taking the product of all vertices between the projective invariant vacuum and inte grating the Reggeons on the real axis in an ordered way and the Pomerons in the upper half plane, as one does for a disk amplitude. We have mentioned above that the two vertices are separately normal ordered, but their product is not normal ordered. When we normal order them we get, for instance for the tachyon of the Pomeron sector, a factor z z p2 2 that describes the Reggeon Pomeron transition. This implies a direct coupling between the U part of gauge field and the two index antisymmetric field B , called Kalb Ramond field , of the Pomeron sector, that makes the gauge field massive . It was then shown that, by factorizing the non planal loop in the Pomeron channel, one reproduced the scattering amplitude containing one state of the Shapiro Virasoro and a number of states of the generalized Veneziano model . If we have also external states belonging to the generalized Shapiro Virasoro model, then by factorizing the non planar one loop ampli tude in the pure Pomeron channel, one would obtain the tree amplitudes of the Shapiro Virasoro model . All this implies that the generalized Veneziano model and the Shapiro Virasoro model are not two independent models, but they are part of the same and unique model. In fact, if one started with the generalized Veneziano model and added loop diagrams to implement unitarity, one found the ap pearence in the non planar loop of additional states that had the same mass and interaction of those of the Shapiro Virasoro model. The planar diagram, written in Eq. in the closed string channel, is divergent for large values of t. This divergence was recognized to be due to exchange, in the Pomeron channel, of the tachyon of the Shapiro Virasoro model and of the dilaton . They correspond, respectively, to the first two terms of the expansion f1 q t 24 O e 2 t 46 Paolo Di

Chunk: of motion The birth of string theory 51 L X L X L X ! 0 and the boundary conditions L X 0 or X 0 at 0, for an open string and X , 0 X , for a closed string. In the case of an open string, the first kind of boundary condition in Eq. corresponds to Neumann boundary conditions, while the second one to Dirichlet boundary conditions. Only the Neumann bound ary conditions preserve the translation invariance of the theory and, there fore, they were mostly used in the early days of string theory. It must be stressed, however, that Dirichlet boundary conditions were already discussed and used in the early days of string theory for constructing models with off shell states . From Eq. one can compute the momentum density along the string L X P cT X X 2 X X X q X X 2 X2X 2 and obtain the following constraints between the dynamical variables X and P c2T 2x 2 P . Because of this one can choose the orthonormal gauge specified by the conditions X2 X X X 0 that nowadays is called conformal gauge. In this gauge eq. becomes P cT X L X cT X and therefore the eq. of motion in eq. becomes X X 0 while the boundary condition in eq. becomes X 0, 0 52 Paolo Di Vecchia The most general solution of the eq. of motion and of the boundary conditions can be written as follows X , q 2 p i 2 X a ne in a n ein cosn n for an open string and X , q 2 p i 2 2 X a ne 2in a n e2in 1 n i 2 2 X a ne 2in a n e2in 1 n for a closed string. This procedure really shows that, starting from the Nambu Goto action, one can choose a gauge the orthonormal or confor mal gauge where the equation of motion of the string becomes the two dimensional D Alembert equation in Eq. . Furthermore, the invariance under reparametrization of the Nambu Goto action implies that the two dimensional energy momentum tensor is identically zero at the classical level See Eq. . As the Lorentz gauge in QED the orthonormal gauge does not fix com pletely the gauge. We can still perform reparametrizations that leave in the conformal gauge they are conformal transformatiuons. Introducing the vari able the generators of the conformal transformations for the open string can be written as follows i I dzzn 1 1 4 X z 2 1 2 X n m na n if p if n if .s that in the conformal gauge become Eq.s .

Chunk: are in reasonable agreement with the experiments. Moreover, one can compute the scattering lenghts .395 .103 and one finds that their ratio is within 10 of the current algebra ratio given by a0 . The amplitude in eq. has exactly the same form as that for four tachyons of the Neveu Schwarz model with the only apparently minor difference that for m 0 instead of 1 as in the Neveu Schwarz model. This difference, however, implies that the critical space time dimension of this model is 10 as in the Neveu Schwarz model. In conclusion this model seems to be a perfectly reasonable model for describing low energy scattering. The problem is, however, that nobody has been able to generalize it to the multipion scattering and therefore to get the complete meson spectrum. As we have seen the S matrix of the dual resonance model was constructed using ideas and tools of hadron phenomenology of the end of the sixties. Although it did not seem possible to write a realistic dual resonance model describing the pions , it was nevertheless such a source of fascination for those who actively worked in this field at that time for its beautiful internal structure and consistency that a lot of energy was used to investigate its properties and for understanding its basic structure. It turned out with great surprise that the underlying structure was that of a quantum relativistic string. The aim of this contribution is to explain the logic of the work that was done in the years from 1968 to 1974 5 in order to uncover the deep properties of this model that appeared from the beginning to be so beautiful and consistent to deserve an intensive study. This seems to me a very good way of celebrating the 65th anniversary of Gabriele who is the person who started and also contributed to develop the whole thing with his deep physical intuition. 2 Construction of the N point amplitude We have seen that the construction of the four point amplitude is not sufficient to get information on the full hadronic spectrum because it contains only those hadrons that couple to two ground state mesons and does not see those intermediate states which only couple to three or to an higher number of ground state mesons . Therefore, it was very important to construct the N point amplitude involving identical scalar particles. The construction of 4 This can be checked by computing the coupling of the spinless particle at the level s 2 and seeing that it vanishes for . 5 Reviews from this period can be found in Ref. The birth of string theory 7 the N point amplitude was done in Ref. extending the work of Ref. by requiring the same principles that have led to the construction of the Veneziano model, namely the fact that the axioms of S matrix theory be satisfied by an infinite number of zero width resonances lying on linearly rising Regge trajectories and planar duality. The fully crossing symmetric scattering amplitude of N identical scalar particles is given by a sum of terms corresponding to the inequivalent permu tations of the external legs 1 An Also in this case two permutations of the external legs are inequivalent if they are not related by a cyclic or anticyclic permutation. Np is the number of inequivalent permutations of the external legs and is equal to N 1 ! 2 and each term has only simple pole singularities in the planar channels. Each planar channel is described by two indices i, j , to mean that it includes the legs i, i 1, i 2 . . . j 1, j, by the Mandelstam variable pi pi 1 . . . pj 2 and by an additional variable uij whose role will become clear soon. It is clear that the channels ij and j 1, i 1

Note that these queries are based on key concepts and points from the academic chunk provided. Please ensure they are relevant and concise. Also note that the queries can be understood by someone not familiar with the topic by giving the context within the academic chunk. For example, the first query, "Dual resonance model and scattering lengths agreement with experiments," is based on the statement from the chunk "are in reasonable agreement with the experiments." Hence, even without prior knowledge, someone can infer from this query that we are specifically looking for information on how the dual resonance model's scattering lengths fare in comparison with actual experiments. Similarly, the second and third queries are formulated based on the differences and challenges mentioned in the chunk about the Neveu Schwarz model and the issue of multipion scattering. Therefore, any results that these queries return will ideally give a clear, concise overview of the main points discussed in the academic chunk.

Chunk: 6 are identical and they should be counted only once. In the case of N identical scalar particles the number of planar channels is equal to N N 3 2 . This can be obtained as follows. The independent planar diagrams involving the particle 1 are of the type 1, i where . . . N 2. Their number is N 3. This is also the number of planar diagrams involving the particle 2 and not the 1. The number of planar diagrams involving the particle 3 and not the particles 1 and 2 is equal to N 4. In general the number of planar diagrams involving the particle i and not the previous ones from 1 to i 1 is equal to N 1 i. This means that the total number of planar diagram is equal to 2 N 3 N 2 X N 1 i 2 N 3 N 4 X 2 N 3 N 4 N 3 N 3 2 If one writes down the duality diagram corresponding to a certain planar ordering of the external particles, it is easy to see that the diagram can have simultaneous pole singularities only in N 3 channels. The channels that allow simultaneous pole singularities are called compatible channels, the other 6 This channel includes the particles j 1, . . . , N, 1, . . . i 1 . 8 Paolo Di Vecchia are called incompatible. Two channels i,j and h,k are incompatible if the following inequalities are satisfied i h j j 1 k i 1 The aim is to construct the scattering amplitude for each inequivalent per mutation of the external legs that has only pole singularities in the N N 3 2 planar channels. We have also to impose that the amplitude has simultaneous poles only in N 3 compatible channels. In order to gain intuition on how to proceed we rewrite the four point amplitude in Eq. as follows A s, t Z 1 0 du12 Z 1 0 du23 u s12 1 12 u s23 1 23 u12 u23 1 where u12 and u23 are the variables corresponding to the two planar chan nels and and the cancellation of simultaneous poles in incompatible channels is provided by the function which forbids u12 and u23 to vanish simultaneously. We will now extend this procedure to the N point amplitude. But for the sake of clarity let us start with the case of . In this case we have 5 planar channels described by u12, u13, u23, u24 and u34. Since we have only two compatible channels only two of the previous five variables are independent. We can choose them to be u12 and u13. In order to determine the depen dence of the other three variables on the two independent ones, we exclude simultaneous poles in incompatible channels. This can be done by imposing relations that prevent variables corresponding to incompatible channels to vanish simultaneously. A sufficient condition for excluding simultaneous poles in incompatible channels is to impose the conditions P u P where the product is over the variables P corresponding to channels that are incompatible with P. In the case of the five point amplitude we get the following relations 1 u34u24 . we write the five point amplitude as follows The birth of string theory 9 Z 1 0 du12 Z 1 0 du13 Z 1 0 du23 Z 1 0 du24 Z 1 0 du34u s12 1 12 u s13 1 13 u s24 1 24 u s23 1 23 u s34 1 34 u23 u12u34 1 u24 u12u13 1 u34 u13u23 1 Performing the integral over the variables u23, u24 and u34 we get Z 1 0 du12 Z 1 0 du13u s12 1 12 u s13 1 13 1 u12 s23 1 1 u13 s13 1 1 u12u13 s24 s23 s34 We have implicitly assumed that the Regge

Chunk: in all possible planar channels. They cor respond to zero width resonances located at non negative integer values n of the Regge trajectory M 2 n. The lowest state located at m2 0 cor responds to the particles on the external legs of BN. The spectrum of excited particles can be obtained by factorizing the N point amplitude in the most general channel with any number of particles. This was done in Ref.s and finding a spectrum of states rising exponentially with the mass M. Being the model relativistic invariant it was found that many states obtained by factorizing the N point amplitude were ghosts , namely states with negative norm as one finds in QED when one quantizes the electromagnetic field in a covariant gauge. The consistency of the model requires the existence of rela tions satisfied by the scattering amplitudes that are similar to those obtained through gauge invariance in QED. If the model is consistent they must decou ple the negative norm states leaving us with a physical spectrum of positive norm states. In order to study in a simple way these issues, we discuss in the next section the operator formalism introduced already in 1969 . Before concluding this section let us go back to the non planar four point amplitude in Eq. and discuss its generalization to an N point amplitude. Using the technique of the electrostatic analogue on the sphere instead of on the disk Shapiro was able to obtain a N point amplitude that reduces to the four point amplitude in Eq. with intercept . The N point amplitude found in Ref. is 14 Paolo Di Vecchia Z QN j zi zj pi pj where za zb 2 za zc 2 zb zc 2 The integral in Eq. is performed in the entire complex plane. 3 Operator formalism and factorization The factorization properties of the dual resonance model were first studied by factorizing by brute force the N point amplitude at the various poles . The number of terms that factorize the residue of the pole at s n, increases rapidly with the value of n. In order to find their degeneracy it turned out to be convenient to first rewrite the N point amplitude in an operator formalism. In this section we introduce the operator formalism and we rewrite the N point amplitude derived in the previous section in this formalism. The key idea is to introduce an infinite set of harmonic oscil lators and a position and momentum operators 7 which satisfy the following commutation relations an , a m nm q , p i where is the flat Minkowski metric that we take to be 1, 1, . . . 1 . A state with momentum p is constructed in terms of a state with zero mo mentum as follows p p peip q 0 p p p 0 0 normalized as 2 d d p p In order to avoid minus signs we use the convention that p 0 eip q A complete and orthonormal basis of vectors in the harmonic oscillator space is given by 1, 2, . . . i p Y n a n n n n p n, n! eip q 0, 0 7 Actually the position and momentum operators were introduced in Ref. . 8 Although we now use an arbitrary d we want to remind you that all original calculations were done for .

Chunk: presence of non sym metric stress energy on the discontinuity hypersurface. We will display non trivial examples of non symmetry in the following section. Notice that the right hand side of is identically null in case g C0 and l C0, since in this case we have g 1 g l g 1 g. 20 A non symmetric Einstein tensor is a feature of Einstein Cartan theory of gravitation see , see also section 7.2 , where it is due to the presence of torsion in the non symmetric connection used to construct generalized curvature. Thus the generalized theory can be interpreted, at least to some extent, as introducing a torsion equivalent tool on the shell only, even if there are no geometrical objects in our theory which can be directly interpretated as torsion. However, Einstein Cartan theory also has a spin angular mo mentum field equation in addition to the Einstein equations, which here is missing. In the literature, compatibility conditions for C0 solutions of boundary layers , and recently of shock waves and thin shells , have been studied also in the framework of Einstein Cartan theory actually this can lead to non symmetric stress energy on the shell. But in that theory this feature is inherited from the ambient spacetime, which is not here non symmetric stress energy arises on the shell only, in consequence of the theory. This interesting feauture probably is worth investigating. 10 Generalized thin shells Now let us consider a more general form of the spherical metric r, t dt2 b r, t dr2 c r, t d 2 Let us consider a match of two spherical solutions of the Einstein equations across a timelike on each side hypersurface of equation t . Again we suppose t C1 and therefore l r t C0. Let the coordinates be C0 globally, and let the metric have the same form in both domains and , with the identification t t , r r , , on . Let moreover a, b, , b, c piecewise C0 be regularly dis continuous on and with regularly discontinuous first derivatives. Again we denote by a dot the partial derivative with respect to t, and by a prime that with respect to r. In this case for the left hand side of the generalized compatibility condi tions l H we obtain 21 l H a b 1 2 bb 1 2 cc 1 t t a a 1 2 c c 1 ba 1 2 r r aa 1 2 cc 1 a a 1 2 r t bb 1 2 b b 1 2 c c 1 t r c b 1 2 ca 1 2 sin2 b 1 a a 1 2 c c 1 a 1 bb 1 2 cc 1 g where, obviously g a t t b r r c sin2 We now mean to interpret as the matter energy of a thin shell. Let us first get back to the particular case 0 static shell and , to make the interpretation simpler by eliminating the non symmetric component rearranging some terms we in fact obtain l H a b 1 2 ac 1 c b 1 2 t t a a 1 2 c c 1 bc 1 c b 1 2 r r c 1 c b 1 2 b 1 a a 1 2 c c 1 g This can be interpretated as a perfect isotropic magneto fluid thin shell with infinite conductivity, i.e. we can solve the compatibility conditions by con sidering the following stress energy as the right hand side T 0 p h2 U U p 1 2 h2 g h h where 0 is the proper density, h the magnetic field and the magnetic permeability here we define h g .

Chunk: of the jump is well defined as the jump of the derivative of the function see . In particular, the derivative of the jump of a continuous field is not null, unless the field is also C1. Similarly, we define the partial derivative of the mean value as the mean value of the partial derivative. We can also use regular prolongations to extend, in a sense, the definition of and to the whole domain . Thus they can be regarded as regular and derivable fields in , but their values and those of their derivatives are well defined only on , while in they depend on the choice of the prolongation. For details on the method of regular prolongations see e.g. . We moreover define the covariant derivative of a field with support on by means of the mean value of the Christoffel symbols. For the jump of a regularly discontinuous vector, for example, with this definition one has that the jump of the covariant derivative is different than the covariant derivative of the jump. Thus, by definition, we have V V V and in consequence of V V V , and similarly for the jump of any regularly discontinuous tensor. Since the spacetime is only C0, we are led to considering C0, piecewise C1 coordinate transformations, with regularly discontinuous first deriva tives the metric discontinuity g is not a tensor with respect to such changes of coordinates. In fact we have 6 g g dx dx dx dx q dx dx q dx dx where q 1 8 g dx dx g dx dx We therefore can simulate all C0, piecewise C1 coordinate changes by com bining C1 changes with metric gauge changes g g q dx dx q dx dx which generalize usual gravitational gauge changes of the theory of C0, piece wise C1 solutions . Is it always possible to make g vanish with an appropriate C0 trans formation? Clearly the answer is negative. In fact it suffices to consider the case when g and g are both definite positive in a given chart to see that the equation obtained from by replacing the first hand side with 0 has no solution for x x and x x . Thus the set of effective generalized gravitational discontinuity hypersurfaces is non empty. Moreover it will occur in many applications to have l C0. Therefore it will be often desiderable to work in the framework of C1, piecewise C2 coordinate transformations, which preserve such condition. The metric dis continuity is a tensor with respect to such changes of coordinates, but the jump of the Christoffel symbols, which appear to play a main role in the following, is not we have in fact x x x x x x 2x x x x x If the coordinates are C0 and so is the form l we can write 2x x x l l 2x where 2 denotes the weak discontinuity of order 2 see e.g. . Thus on we can generate all C1, piecewise C2 transformations for combining C2 transformations with respect to which is a tensor and Christoffel gauges transformations, i.e. of the kind 7 l l Q with some analogy with the case of C0 metrics where the main role is played by the first order metric discontinuity g, see section 3 . In any case neither the mean value of the metric g or its jump g now have null covariant derivatives. Consider in fact the identity g 0 in the domain from the limit f 0 , on we have g g g 0 Here, with obvious meaning of the symbols, we denote g g , g g , etc. Consequently on , from 1 we have g 1 2 g g g 1 2 g g g g 1 4 g g 0 Similarly, from the limit f 0 and from 2 we also have

This would likely lead further into understanding the specifics of how the function's jump is defined and its properties.

Chunk: r Now let us define the match as a generalized regularly discontinuous solution by , with , i.e. in the absence of stress energy concentrated on . In this case our compatibility conditions reduce to l l 0 which, for a match of metrics of the kind , are equivalent to the following system bb 1 a b 1 0 ba 1 a a 1 0 a a 1 aa 1 0 b b 1 bb 1 0 b 1 0 i.e. we have b 0 and consequently b a 0 ba 1 a a 1 0 a a 1 aa 1 0 b b 0 and from b a 0 b a a 1 0 a a a 1 a a a b b 0 16 Now if we had both b a 0 and b a 0, by we would have b a 0 on both sides of the hypersurface. We discard for the moment this singular situation, and from 2 we conclude that a 1 0. Thus in this case our generalized compatibility conditions imply a b 0, i.e. they force the match to be C0, piecewise C1. In we have already studied some examples of C0, piecewise C1 matchs of metrics of the kind at a hypersurface of constant radius , with l r. Namely, we have considered external Schwarzschild internal Schwarzschild external Schwarzschild Tolman VI external Schwarzschild Tolman V. Such matchs obviously have l C0 moreover condition b a 0 reduce in this case to a 0, which is obviously satisfied. In each case we have verified that condition a b 0 imply where denotes first order discontinuity , which then define the match as a boundary layer it actually also imply , as one can verify . Such is a general result, since for a metric of the kind the completely temporal and radial components of the Einstein tensor are independent from the second derivatives of the metric b r b2 b r2b2 a r ab a ar2 so that the corresponding vacuum Einstein equations reduce to b r b2 , a r ab . Now, since in the match of vacuum solutions equations are satisfied on each side of the interface , their jump is in particular null, and from we have rb b 2b 1 b 0 rb a a b b 1 a 0 from which it clearly follows that conditions a b 0 imply a b 0, i.e. 0. Summarizing, for the match of two piecewise C0 regularly discontinuous spherical solutions, in the above hypothesis, generalized compatibility con ditions imply a b 0 i.e. they force the match to be C0. On the other hand conditions a b 0 imply that is a boundary layer. 17 Therefore for such spherical matchs generalized compatibility conditions are necessary and sufficient for the match to be a boundary layer. 7 Generalized gravitational shock waves Let us consider the match of two plane wave metrics of the form d F 2dx2 G 2dy2 across a hypersurface of equation 0. Here and are the two null coordinates. We suppose continuously matching coordinates and F, G reg ularly discontinuous, together with their first and second derivatives. The gradient vector of is the continuous characteristic on each side of vector l . Generalized compatibility conditions in the case i.e. no stress energy concentrated on the hypersurface reduce to the following single scalar equation F 1F G 1G 0 which characterize the generalized gravitational shock wave. Let us now study compatibility of with the Einstein Equations. Einstein vacuum equations also reduce to a single scalar equation F 1F G 1G 0 which we suppose to hold on each side of the hypersurface thus replacing F and G by their expressions in terms of F, F , G and G according to gives rise to the following couple scalar conditions 2F F 2G G 2G G 2F F 0

Chunk: 2F F 2G G 2G G 2F F 0 Equations are compatible with , i.e. the three equations set can be solved algebraically with respect to F, G and to any member of the pair F, G , and the solution is not necessarily trivial. Finally let us notice that, if the additional condition F G 0 holds, i.e. if the solution is C0, condition reduces to F 1 F G 1 G 0 i.e. 18 F 1 F G 1 , according to section 10.5. 8 Slow generalized gravitational waves Let us start trying to match two vacuum solutions of the kind across the timelike on both sides hypersurface of equation . Again we suppose continuously matching coordinates, F, G regularly discontinuous to gether with their first and second derivatives, and . This times gener alized compatibility conditions include and the following two additional scalar conditions FF 0, GG 0 i.e., in terms of F, F , G and G , according to F F F F 0 G G G G 0 It is easy to check that the system is not compatible with , in the sense that the whole system does not admit non trivial solutions for F, F , G and G . On the other hand we have proved in section 6 that a wide class of gen eralized spherical matchs at a hypersurface of constant radius necessarily degenerate to a C0 match. Other examples of degeneracy have not been included in the paper for the sake of brevity, but at least it seems to be a hard task to construct a non trivial generalized match across a timelike on each side hypersurface, with no stress energy content. Such difficulty is certainly not a proof that this is an impossible task, but it makes us wonder whether such a solution should necessarily degenerate to a boundary layer, just like it happens for ordinary C0 solutions see e.g. . This would forbid the existence of generalized solutions which propagate at a speed slower than light. Such would be a desiderable prohibition under certain respect, since one could expect that 19 gravitational interactions in vacuo must necessarily propagate at the speed of light also in a generalized theory. In general terms, since for generalized solutions the metric is discontinu ous, a hypersurface can in principle have different signatures on the different sides for this reason we cannot simply distinguish between the timelike and the lightlike case, as for usual C0 solutions. We should rather distinguish between three cases timelike timelike, timelike lightlike or conversely and lightlike lightlike. In any case it is legitimate to expect that, at least in the timelike timelike case, similar to the timelike case of C0, piecewise C1 solutions, absence of stress energy concentrated on should imply the solution to degenerate to a boundary layer . Unfortunately for generalized solutions we still have no proof that absence of stress energy concentrated on does necessarily imply the degeneracy of the solution to a boundary layer. Therefore, although the examples considered in this paper seem to sug gest that such property could hold true also in the generalized case, for the moment such result is still a conjecture we thus have to admit that the the ory in principle allows propagation of generalized gravitational shock waves at lower speed than the speed of light. We would call such waves slow gen eralized gravitational shock waves . It would be reasonable to forbid this situation as unphysical, but for now this can only be done ad hoc, by means of a corresponding additional hypothesis. 9 Non symmetric stress energy Notice that l H is not necessarily symmetric from identity 1 2 g 1 g where g denotes the determinant of the contravariant metric, we have l H 1 4 l g 1 g l g 1 g Thus the generalized scheme allows in principle the

Chunk: A0 L12, A0 V0, 12 L10, A1 V1, 10 Moreover, for all i we define ei, fi . As the ei have by construction associated matrix ei i 1 once restricted to V and the fi are their respective adjoints, one gets Proposition 6.10. The operators ei, fj, hk satisfy the Serre relations for sl 6, C and the hi span the Cartan subalgebra H H1 H2 S1 S2 H0 H1 S2 H0 H1 H2 H0 H1 S2 H1 H2 S1 S2 It would be interesting as a last remark to identify in the list of quadratic in variants the geometric operators Lij, ij, Vj, Aj, the algebra H and the so 2, R generator J. To do this one could of course use the explicit matrices for the qua dratic invariants once restricted to V , which are not difficult to compute. One can however get very quickly a qualitative picture by using the notion of multidegree which we now introduce. The decomposition T , which we indicate with mdeg. This follows from the equation n T n p W0 C q W1 C r W2 C We notice furthermore that the complexified decomposition above is preserved by the operator J, and therefore mdeg commutes with the action of so 2, R . Proposition 6.11. The operators Lj, Vj, j, Aj, Hj, Sj are mdeg homogeneous, with multi degrees mdeg L0 0, 1, 1 mdeg L1 1, 0, 1 mdeg L2 1, 1, 0 mdeg 0 0, 1, 1 mdeg 1 1, 0, 1 mdeg 2 1, 1, 0 mdeg V0 2, 0, 0 mdeg V1 0, 2, 0 mdeg V2 0, 0, 2 mdeg A0 2, 0, 0 mdeg A1 0, 2, 0 mdeg A2 0, 0, 2 mdeg H0 0, 0, 0 mdeg H1 0, 0, 0 mdeg H2 0, 0, 0 mdeg S0 0, 0, 0 mdeg S1 0, 0, 0 mdeg S2 0, 0, 0 Proof The values for mdeg for the Lj and the Vj follow immediately from mdeg of the corresponding forms and the dual contraction operators have opposite value 16 GIOVANNI GAIFFI, MICHELE GRASSI of mdeg. The remaing values can be computed using the additivity of mdeg with respect to the bracket. Proposition 6.12. .

The mdegs of the quadratic monomials are immedi ately computed as they are the sum of those of their components. For example, mdeg Ew0 mdeg Ew0 1, 0, 0 , mdeg Ew1 mdeg Ew1 0, 1, 0 and therefore mdeg Ew0, Ew1 1, 1, 0 , equal to that of L12 and L22.

Chunk: ahler manifolds. An example of these comes from mirror symmetry for abelian varieties. Remark 1.2. The form D is symplectic once restricted to 0 1 0 2. We have therefore that dim X m D 0. Definition 1.3. 1 A WSD manifold is nondegenerate if dim 0 1 0 2 equivalently if its dimension is 3 times the rank . 2 A WSD manifold is self dual SD manifold for brevity if all the leaves of the distribution 0 1 0 2 have volume one with respect to the volume form induced by the metric Using Self dual manifolds, you can give a first na ve geometric definition of Mir ror Symmetry as follows Two Calabi Yau manifolds with B field M, BM and M, B M are mirror dual if there is a Self dual manifold X together with surjections X M and X M such that a M 1, M 2. b The leaves of 1 are the fibres of c The leaves of 2 are the fibres of d The induced B fields on M and M are the ones given. Here make their first appearence the B fields BM and B M, which are flat unitary gerbes on M and M respectively, and which are not relevant for the discussions of this paper. In G2 it was shown that this picture works well in the case of elliptic curves, and for some other flat situations. Physical motivation. One of the reasons to introduce SD manifolds however was to get rid of special lagrangian fibrations, which are so difficult to construct, and to be able to attack the problem of Mirror Symmetry also when these fibra tions are not expected to exist. In this more general context one expects that the Mirror Symmetry phaenomenon will not be obtained directly from fibrations of a SD manifold to the dual Calabi Yaus, but via a more sophisticated procedure, which involves a Gromov Hausdorfftype of limit. In G3 it was shown that for the family of anticanonical divisors in complex projective space one can build a real two dimensional family of WSD manifolds, which degenerate in a normalized Gromov Hausdorffsense to the correct limits of the mirror dual Calabi Yaus. The picture is the following A GEOMETRIC REALIZATION OF sl 6, C 3 MB MA S T B A 2 1 where MA and MB are the large K ahler and large complex structure limits of M and M respectively. To be precise, the manifolds which come out of the costruc tion of G3 are 11 dimensional degenerate Weakly self dual manifolds or rank 3. Dimension 11 is very appealing in this context from a physical point of view, and it brings us to the motivation for the present work. The point of view of G3 is very different from the current one in the main liter ature on mathematical Mirror Symmetry instead of considering the fibre product M B M when it exists as a device for proving Mirror Symmetry for Calabi Yaus, the limiting Calabi Yaus of Mirror Symmetry are seen as very special limits of a family of Self Dual manifolds, which are the main objects of study. This is actually more in line with what can be found in the physical literature, where the models defining the string theories from which Mirror Symmetry originates are seen as just phases of a unique theory, which is not necessarily in the form of a model but could very likely be similar to a quantized Gauge theory on an 11 dimensional manifold. To make this circle of ideas more concrete and hence more verifiable at the end of G3 it is suggested that one should try to build a natural gauge theory on Self dual manifolds the hope is that once quantized this gauge theory might in terpolate between the models associated to the Calabi Yau s, and as

Chunk: adapted basis. Using the chosen orthonormal basis, one can define corresponding non canon ical wedge and contraction operators 6 GIOVANNI GAIFFI, MICHELE GRASSI Definition 2.3. Let i and j . The operators Eij and Iij are respectively the wedge and the contraction operator with the form vij on V T X defined using the given basis we use the notation vij to indicate the element of TpX dual to vij T p X Eij vij , Iij vij Proposition 2.4. The operators Eij, Iij satisfy the following relations i, j, k, l , , j EijIij i, j k, l , j E , I . Proof The proof is a simple direct verification, which we omit. It is then immediate to verify that Proposition 2.5. J can be expressed as 0 E2jI1j E1jI2j on the whole V T p X. From this expression and the previous proposition one ob tains that , i.e. for every p the Lie algebra generated by J is a subalgebra of o V T p X isomorphic to so 2, R R. Moreover, the exponential images in side AutR X of the operators of type tJ for t R form a group isomorphic to SO 2, R S1, as this isomorphism holds for the faithful restriction of the group action to T p X. Using the non canonical operators Eij we can obtain simple expressions for the pointwise action of the other canonical operators, the volume forms Vj Definition 2.6. For V T p X, V0 E10E20 , V1 E11E21 , V2 E12E22 Remember however that the operators Vj do not depend on the choice of a basis, as they are simply multiplication by the volume forms of the spaces Wj. We use the vij also as a orthonormal basis for the complexified space T p R C with respect to the induced hermitian inner product . We indicate with the same symbols Vj the complexified operators acting on the spaces V C T p X. The riemannian metric induces a Riemannian metric on T p X and on the space V T p X. Definition 2.7. For j , , Vj, j, Aj on V T p X are the point wise restrictions of corresponding global operators on smooth differential forms, which we indicate with the same symbols for j , Lj, Vj, j, Aj X X Summing up A GEOMETRIC REALIZATION OF sl 6, C 7 Definition 2.8. The Lie algebra L is the Lie subalgebra of EndR X gen erated by the operators The operator on L is induced by the adjoint with respect to the Riemannian metric. The Lie algebra LC is L C, and is in a natural way a Lie subalgebra of EndC C X . The operator on LC is induced by the adjoint with respect to the induced Hermitian metric. The canonical splitting T p , which propagates to V T X and to its C sections. At every point, the action can be written explicitly in terms of the basis as vij vi j The induced action on endomorphisms via conjugation, 1, preserves LC.

Chunk: invariants inside C2 p the quadratic J invariants coincides with LC. To describe it explicitely, let us introduce the following notation Definition 5.8. E2j, E2j I2j, I2j Lemma 5.9. The adjoint action of the operator J on Ewj, Iwj, Ewj, Iwj is J, Ewj Ewj, J, Iwj Iwj J, Ewj Ewj, J, Iwj Iwj Proof It is enough to consider the corresponding J weights of the wj, wj. Proposition 5.10. The following 36 operators provide a linear basis for the qua dratic J invariants Ew0, Ew1 , Ew0, Ew2 , Ew1, Ew2 , Ew1, Ew0 , Ew2, Ew0 , Ew2, Ew1 Iw0, Iw1 , Iw0, Iw2 , Iw1, Iw2 , Iw1, Iw0 , Iw2, Iw0 , Iw2, Iw1 Ew0, Ew0 , Ew1, Ew1 , Ew2, Ew2 Iw0, Iw0 , Iw1, Iw1 , Iw2, Iw2 Ew0, Iw1 , Ew0, Iw2 , Ew1, Iw0 , Ew1, Iw2 , Ew2, Iw0 , Ew2, Iw1 Ew0, Iw1 , Ew0, Iw2 , Ew1, Iw0 , Ew1, Iw2 , Ew2, Iw0 , Ew2, Iw1 Ew0, Iw0 , Ew1, Iw1 , Ew2, Iw2 , Ew0, Iw0 , Ew1, Iw1 , Ew2, Iw2 Proof The J weight of a bracket of J homogeneous operators is the sum of the respective weights. The quadratic monomials with respect to the bracket in the Ewj, Iwj, Ewj, Iwj are all J homogeneous, and therefore to find a basis of J invariant quadratic operators it is enough to identify the J invariant quadratic monomials. To be J invariant means simply to have weight zero, and the compu tation of the J weight of the quadratic mononials follows immediately from those of Ewj, Iwj, Ewj, Iwj, which are respectively , , , . We end this section with the following Theorem 5.11. In the exact sequence of Theorem 4.3 the kernel K is equal to . The algebra LC is therefore isomorphic to sl 6, C . Proof Since LC is included in the Lie algebra of quadratic invariants, it is enough to show that J LC, as from this and the previous proposition it follows that dimC LC 35. As LC maps surjectively to sl 6, C which has dimension 35, the kernel must be zero. When restricted to the subrepresentation V , the generators of LC have all trace zero by inspection of their matrices. However, by definition of V , J restricted to it is multiplication by 2 , and has therefore trace equal to 12 . Corollary 5.12. The Lie algebra equals the Lie algebra of quadratic invariants inside C2 p. A GEOMETRIC REALIZATION OF sl 6, C 13 6. A geometric presentation of Serre generators In this section, to gain a better geometric understanding of the representation LC of sl 6, C , we explore in greater detail its relation to the geometric structure of a WSD manifold. In particular, we give a presentation of a natural choice of Cartan subalgebra and Serre generators in terms on the geometric generators Lj, j, Vj, Aj. The Lj operators are similar in nature to the Lefschetz operators of a K ahler manifold. This analogy is what provided the initial interest in the algebraic struc ture of LC. Similarly to the corresponding standard construction of a representation of sl 2, C , we define Definition 6.1. For j Lj, j These operators are self adjoint, as L j by definition. As in the context of K ahlerian geometry, it is natural to associate a metric q to the WSD manifold, and we will assume that. To a self-adjoint operator we can associate the spectral radius, this gives a quadratic Lj functional. Moreover, as the trace of the square of the self-adjoint operators is positive, we obtain a quadratic Lj positive functional. Given that the metric q has a positive definite part, the Lj quadratic functional is also positive. We can then associate a quadratic weighted projector F to the Lj functional. The operators Lj generate the Lie subalgebra of quadratic invariants inside C2 p.

Chunk: to M . Example 1.16. Assume that 2 M, L 0. Then the homology class of a point is an Albers element of L, and hence L is heavy. Note that in this case heaviness cannot be improved to superheaviness the meridian on the two torus is heavy but not superheavy. Here we took . Example 1.17 Lagrangian spheres in Fermat hypersurfaces . More exam ples of heavy but not necessarily superheavy monotone Lagrangian sub manifolds can be constructed as follows3. Let M CP n 1 be a smooth complex hypersurface of degree d. The pull back of the standard symplectic structure from CP n 1 turns M into a symplectic manifold of real dimension 2n . If d 2, then, as it is explained, for instance, in , M contains a Lagrangian sphere M can be included into a family of algebraic hypersurfaces of CP n 1 with quadratic degenerations at isolated points and the vanishing cycle of such a degeneration can be realized by a Lagrangian sphere following , , , , . Let M CP n 1 be a projective hypersurface of degree d, 2 . The minimal Chern number of M equals N n 2 . Let Ln M2n be a simply connected Lagrangian submanifold for instance, a Lagrangian sphere . First, consider the case when n is even, L is relatively spin and the Euler characteristics of L does not vanish this is the case for a sphere . Then the 3We thank P.Biran for his indispensable help with these examples. 20 homology class j L Hn M Z is non zero its self intersection number in M up to the sign equals the Euler characteristic. Thus L is an Albers element. Here we use . In view of Theorem 1.15, L is heavy with respect to M . Second, suppose that n is of arbitrary parity but , and no restriction on the Euler characteristics of L is assumed anymore. This yields n 1 and thus L satisfies the Albers condition with the class of a point P as an Albers element. Thus L is heavy with respect to M here we use . Finally, fix n 3 and an even number d such that 4 . Consider a Fermat hypersurface of degree d zd 0 zd 1 . . . zd n CP n 1 . Its real part L M RP n 1 lies in the affine chart z0 0 and is given by the equation xd 1 . . . xd n , where xj Re zj z0 . Since d is even, L is an n dimensional sphere. As it was explained above, L is heavy with respect to M if either n is even and or and . However, in either case L is not superheavy with respect to M . Indeed, let d Zd be the group of complex roots of unity. Given a vector 1, . . . , n d n 1, denote by f the symplectomorphism of M given by f z0 z1 . . . zn 1 z0 1z1 . . . n 1zn 1 . If all j C R, then jx R whenever x R , and thus f L . Therefore L is strongly displaceable and the claim follows from the part iii of Theorem 1.2. The next result gives a user friendly sufficient condition of superheaviness. Theorem 1.18. Assume L is homologically non trivial in M and assume a QH2n M is a non zero idempotent divisible by j L in QH M , that is a j L QH M . Then L is superheavy with respect to a. The homological non triviality of L in the hypothesis of the theorem means just that L is an Albers element of L see Example 1.14 . In fact, the theorem can be generalized to the cases when L has other

Chunk: line equals 1 . Identify CP n with the symplectic cut of the Euclidean ball B Cn that is the boundary of B is collapsed to CP n 1 along the fibers of the Hopf fibration, see , where B r . Then B r CP n is i displaceable for ii strongly non displaceable but stably displaceable for r 1 2, n n 1 iii strongly and stably non displaceable for r n n 1. It is instructive to analyze the techniques involved in the proofs The strong non displaceability result in ii is an immediate consequence of Gromov s packing by two balls theorem, which is proved via the J holomorphic variant of the theorem which states that there exists a J holomorphic line in CP n passing through any two points. In the case iii the ball B r contains the Clifford torus, which is stably non displaceable. This follows either from the fact that the Clifford torus is a stem see , or from non vanishing of its Lagrangian Floer homology . The displaceability of B r in i follows from the explicit construction of the two balls packing see . The stable displaceability in ii is a direct consequence of Theorem 1.7 above Indeed, consider the standard Tn action on CP n. The normalized moment polytope Rn has the , where 1, . . . , n denote coordinates in Rn, and 1, . . ., 1 . Note that the ball B r equals to 1 r where r r stand w. Note that r does not contain the origin exactly when r n n 1 which yields the stable displaceability in ii above. A mysterious feature of Example 1.28 is as follows. On the one hand, we believe in the following general empiric principle whenever one can establish the non displaceability of a subset by means of the Floer homology theory, one gets for free the stable non displaceability. On the other hand, we be lieve, following a philosophical explanation provided by Biran, that Gromov s packing by two balls theorem may be extracted from some operations in Floer homology. Example 1.28 shows that at least one of these beliefs is wrong. It would be interesting to clarify this issue. 1.7.2 Heavy fibers of Poisson commutative subspaces It was shown in that for any finite dimensional Poisson commutative subspace A C M at least one of the fibers of its moment map has to be non displaceable. Question. Is it true that at least one fiber of has to be heavy with respect to some non zero idempotent a QH M ? It is easy to construct an example of A whose moment map has no superheavy fibers take T2 with the coordinates p, q mod 1 on it and take A to be the set of all smooth functions depending only on p the corresponding defines the fibration of T2 by meridians none of which is superheavy. Here is another question which concerns fibers of symplectic toric man ifolds, i.e. fibers of a moment map of an effective Hamiltonian Tn action on M2n, . Assume M is spherically monotone. Theorem 1.9 shows that in such a case the special fiber of M is superheavy, hence stably and strongly non displaceable. In all the examples where it has been checked this turns out to be the only non displaceable fiber of M. Question. Is the special fiber for a monotone symplectic toric M always a stem? In particular, is it the only non displaceable fiber of the moment map? In the monotone case the special fiber is clearly the only heavy fiber of the moment map, because it is superheavy and any other heavy fiber would have had to intersect it. On the other hand, if we consider a Hamiltonian Tk action on M2n with for instance, because of purely topological obstructions the

Chunk: Calabi and mixed action Maslov . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 76 2 1 Introduction and main results 1.1 Many facets of displaceability A well studied and easy to visualize rigidity property of subsets of a symplec tic manifold M, is the rigidity of intersections a subset X M cannot be displaced from the closure of a subset Y M by a compactly supported Hamiltonian isotopy X Y Ham M . We say in such a case that X cannot be displaced from Y . If X cannot be displaced from itself we call it non displaceable. These properties become especially interesting and purely symplectic when X can be displaced from itself or from Y by a compactly supported smooth isotopy. One of the main themes of the present paper is that some non displace able sets are more rigid than others. To explain this, we need the following ramifications of the notion of a non displaceable set Strong non displaceability A subset X M is called strongly non displaceable if one cannot displace it by any not necessarily Hamiltonian symplectomorphism of M, . Stable non displaceability Consider T S1 with the coordi nates r, and the symplectic form dr d . We say that X M is stably non displaceable if X is non displaceable in M T S1 equipped with the split symplectic form dr d . Let us mention that de tecting stably non displaceable subsets is useful for studying geometry and dynamics of Hamiltonian flows see for instance for their role in Hofer s geometry and for their appearance in the context of kick stability in Hamiltonian dynamics . Formally speaking, the properties of strong and stable non displaceability are mutually independent and both are strictly stronger than displaceability. In the present paper we refine the machinery of partial symplectic quasi states introduced in and get new examples of stably non displaceable sets, including certain fibers of moment maps of Hamiltonian torus actions as well as monotone Lagrangian submanifolds discussed by Albers and Biran Cornea . Further, we address the following question given the class of stably non displaceable sets, can one distinguish those of them which are 3 also strongly non displaceable by means of the Floer theory? Or, other way around, what are the Floer homological features of stably non displaceable but strongly displaceable sets? Toy examples are given by the equator of the symplectic two sphere and by the meridian on a symplectic two torus. Both are stably non displaceable since their Lagrangian Floer homologies are non trivial. On the other hand, the equator is strongly non displaceable, while the meridian is strongly displaceable by a non Hamiltonian shift. Later on we shall explain the difference between these two examples from the viewpoint of Hamiltonian Floer homology and present various generalizations. The question on Floer homological characterization of strongly non displa ceable but stably displaceable sets is totally open, see Section 1.7.1 below for an example involving Gromov s packing theorem and discussion. Leaving Floer theoretical considerations for the next section, let us outline in parts, informally the general scheme of our results Given a symplectic manifold M, , we shall define in the language of the Floer theory two collections of closed subsets of M, heavy subsets and superheavy subsets. Every superheavy subset is heavy, but, in general, not vice versa. Formally speaking, the hierarchy heavy superheavy depends in a delicate way on the choice of an idempotent in the quantum homology ring of M. This and other nuances will be ignored in this outline. The key properties of these collections are as follows see Theorems 1.2 and 1.5 below Invariance Both collections are invariant under the group of all symplec tomorphisms of M. Stable non displaceability Every heavy subset is stably non displace able. Intersections Every superheavy subset intersects every

Chunk: asymptotic calculations with Floer homology in the next sections. There are several routes leading to this fact, which is quite natural since all homogeneous quasi morphisms on Sp 2k are proportional, and hence the same quasi morphism admits quite dissimilar definitions . We extract the quasi morphism property from the paper of Robbin and Salamon by bringing together several statements contained therein7. The Conley Zehnder index assigns to each , u ePF a number. Orig inally the Conley Zehnder index was defined only for regular Hamiltonians in this case it is integer valued and gives rise to a grading of the ho mology groups in Floer theory. Later the definition was extended in different ways by different authors to arbitrary Hamiltonians. We will use such an ex tension introduced in also see . In this case the Conley Zehnder index may take also half integer values. Let k be a natural number. Consider the symplectic vector space R2k with a symplectic form 2k on it. Denote by p1, . . . , pk , q1, . . . , qk the corresponding Darboux coordinates on the vector space R2k. 7We thank V.L. Ginzburg for stimulating discussions on the material of this section. 36 Robbin Salamon index of Lagrangian paths Let V R2k be a Lagrangian subspace. Consider the Grassmannian Lagr k of all Lagrangian subspaces in R2k and consider the hypersurface V Lagr k formed by all the Lagrangian subspaces that are not transversal to V . To such a V and to any smooth path , 0 t 1, in Lagr k Robbin and Salamon associate an index, which may take integer or half integer values and which we will denote by RS , V . The definition of the index can be outlined as follows. A number t is called a crossing if Lt V . To each crossing t one associates a certain quadratic form Qt on the space L t V see for the precise definition. The crossing t is called regular if the quadratic form Qt is non degenerate. The index of such a regular crossing t is defined as the signature of Qt if 1 and as half of the signature of Qt if , 1. One can show that regular crossings are isolated. For a path with only regular crossings the index RS , V is defined as the sum of the indices of its crossings. An arbitrary path can be perturbed, keeping the endpoints fixed, into a path with only regular crossings and the index of the perturbed path does not depend on the perturbation in fact, it depends only on the fixed endpoints homotopy class of the path. Moreover, it is additive with respect to the concatenation of paths and satisfies the naturality property RS , AV RS , V for any symplectic matrix A. Indices of paths in Sp 2k Consider the group Sp 2k of symplectic 2k 2k matrices. Denote by Sp 2k its universal cover. One can use the index RS in order to define two indices on the space of smooth paths in Sp 2k . The first index, denoted by Ind2k, is defined as follows. Fix a Lagrangian subspace V R2k. For each smooth path , 0 t 1, in Sp 2k define Ind2k , V as Ind2k , V RS , V . The naturality of the RS index implies that RS , BV RS , BV RS , V for any B Sp 2k and thus we get the following naturality condition for Ind2k Ind2k , BV Ind2k , V for any B Sp 2k . 37 The second index, which we will call the Conley Zehnder index of a matrix path and which will be denoted by CZmatr, is defined as follows. For each A Sp 2k denote by Gr A the graph of A which is a Lagrangian subspace of the symplectic

Using the PSS isomorphism one defines the spectral numbers c a, F , where 0 a QH M , in the usual way .

Chunk: another important property of spectral numbers 43 Poincar e duality c b, infa b c a, 1 for all b QH M and . Here b denotes the set of all a QH M with a, b 0. The Poincar e duality can be extracted from cf. for a proof see . The next property is an immediate consequence of the definitions see for a discussion in the monotone case Characteristic exponent property Given 0 F, a, b QH M , a, b, a b 0, and a time dependent Hamiltonian H, one has c a, H c a, H and c a b, H max c a, H , c b, H . 3.5 Partial symplectic quasi states Given a non zero idempotent a QH2n M and a time independent Hamil tonian H M R, define a, H lim l c a, lH l . When a is fixed, we shall often abbreviate H instead of a, H . The limit in the formula always exists and thus the functional C M R is well defined. The functional on C M is Lipschitz with respect to the C0 norm H and therefore extends to a functional C M R, where C M is the space of all continuous functions on M. These facts were proved in in the case M but the proofs actually go through for any non zero idempotent a QH2n M . Here we will list the properties of for such an M. Again, these proper ties were proved in in the case M but the proof goes through for any non zero idempotent a QH2n M . The additivity with respect to con stants property was not explicitly listed in but follows immediately from the definition of and the Hamiltonian shift property of spectral numbers. The triangle inequality follows readily from the definition of and from the triangle inequality for the spectral numbers. Theorem 3.6. The functional C M R satisfies the following prop erties Semi homogeneity F F for any F and any R 0. 44 Triangle inequality If F1, F2 C M , 0 then F1 F2 F1 F2 . Partial additivity and vanishing If F1, F2 C M , 0 and the support of F2 is displaceable, then F1 F2 F1 in particular, if the support of F C M is displaceable, F 0. Additivity with respect to constants and normalization F F for any F and any R. In particular, 1. Monotonicity F G for F G. Symplectic invariance F F f for every symplectic diffeomorphism f Symp0 M . Characteristic exponent property a1 a2, F max a1, F , a2, F for each pair of non zero idempotents a1, a2 with a1 , a1 a2 0 in this case a1 a2 is also a non zero idempotent , and for all F C M . We will call the functional C M R satisfying all the properties listed in Theorem 3.6 a partial symplectic quasi state. 4 Basic properties of super heavy sets In this section we prove parts i and iii of Theorem 1.2, as well as The orem 1.3. We shall use that a partial symplectic quasi state extends by continuity in the uniform norm to a monotone functional on the space of continuous functions C M , see Section 3.5 above. In particular, one can use continuous functions instead of the smooth ones in the definition of su per heaviness in formulae and . Assume a partial quasi state defined by a non zero idempotent is fixed and we consider heaviness and superheaviness with respect to . We start with the following elementary Proposition 4.1.

Chunk: b KH V2 . 49 Next we define spectral invariants associated to a decorated complex V V, , F, d . Namely, for a H V put c a inf . We shall see below that c a for each a 0. The purpose of this algebraic digression is to state the following result Theorem 5.2. For any two decorated complexes V1, V2 c a1 a2 c a1 c a2 a1 H V1 , a2 H V2 5.3 Reduced Floer and Quantum homology The 2 periodicity of the Floer complex and Floer homology defined by the multiplication by q see Proposition 3.1 above allows to encode their al gebraic structure in a decorated Z2 complex. Consider a regular pair G, J consisting of a Hamiltonian function and a compatible almost complex struc ture on M both, in general, are time dependent . Let C G , dG,J be the corresponding Floer complex. Let us associate to it a Z2 complex a Z2 graded vector space VG over K , defined as VG C0 G C1 G , with the obvious Z2 grading, and a differential G,J VG VG, defined as the direct sum of dG,J C1 G C0 G and qdG,J C0 G C1 G . One readily checks that this is indeed a Z2 complex because dG,J C G C G is linear. We will call VG, G,J the Z2 complex associated to G, J . Note that the cycles and the boundaries of VG, G having Z2 degree i in VG coincide, respectively, with the cycles and the boundaries having Z degree i of C G , dG,J . Therefore the Floer homology HFi G, J is isomorphic, as a vector space over K , to the i th degree component of the homology of the complex VG, G,J . The Z2 complex VG, G,J carries a structure of the decorated complex VG,J as follows. Let i t , , . . . , m, be the collection of all contractible 1 periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian flow generated by G. Choose disc ui in M spanning i. For each i there exists unique integer, say ri, so that the Conley Zehnder index of the element xi qri i, ui lies in the set 50 . Clearly, the collection forms a basis of VG over K . We shall consider it as a preferred basis. Note that the preferred basis is unique up to multiplication of xi s by elements of the form s i, i . Finally, the action functional associated to G defines a filtration on VG. The homology of VG, G,J can be canonically identified via the PSS isomorphism with the object which we call reduced quantum homology QHred M QH0 M QH1 M . We call this isomorphism the reduced PSS isomorphism and denote it by G,J. Note that we have a natural projection p QH M QHred M which sends any degree homogeneous element a to aqr with deg a 2r . With this notation, the usual Floer homological spectral invariant c a, G coincides with the spectral invariant c p a of the decorated complex VG,J. 5.4 Proof of Theorem 5.1 By the Lipschitz property of spectral numbers it is enough to consider the case when G1 and G2 belong to regular pairs Gi, Ji , , 2. Set G z1, z2, t G1 z1, t G z2, t and J J1 J2. Then G, J is also a regular pair. Put Mi, i . It is straightforward to see that the decorated complex VG,J is the b K tensor product of the decorated complexes VGi,Ji for , 2. Put M, M1 M2, 1 2 . An obvious modification of the K unneth formula for quantum homology see e.g. 41, Exercise 11.1.15 for the state ment in the monotone case yields a natural monomorphism QHi1 M1, 1 b KQHi2 M1, 1 QHi1

Chunk: 2. 55 Suppose that a1 v . Then v is of the form ,l m l h m h l w where w must lie in W. Observe that H1 H2 . By Lemma 5.3, F v max m,l F m l h m h l , and hence c a1 a2 max m,l F m l h m h l max m,l F1 m h m F2 l h l max m F1 m h m max l F2 l h l c a1 c a2 . In the last equality we used . This completes the proof of Theorem 5.2 for decorated complexes in general position. It remains to remove the general position assumption. This will be done with the help of the following lemma. We shall work with a family of deco rated complexes V V, ,...,n, F, d, which have exactly the same data preferred basis, grading, differential and with the exception of the filter F which will be allowed to vary in the class of filters. The corresponding spectral invariants will be denoted by c a, F . 56 Lemma 5.5. i If filters F, F satisfy F xi F xi for all , . . . , n, then c a, F c a, F for all non zero classes a H V . ii If F is a filter and R, then F is again a filter and c a, F c a, F for all non zero classes a H V . The proof is obvious and we omit it. It follows that for any two filters F, F c a, F c a, F F F C0 a H V . Assume now that V1, V2 are decorated complexes. Denote by F1, F2 their filters. Fix o 0. By a small perturbation of the filters we get new filters, F 1 and F 2, on our complexes so that the complexes become generic and in general position, and furthermore F1 F 1 C0 o , F2 F 2 C0 o . Given homology classes ai H Vi we have c a1, F1 c a2, F2 c a1 a2, F1 F2 c a1, F 1 c a2, F 2 c a1 a2, F 1 F 2 4o 4o . Here we used that Theorem 5.2 is already proved for generic complexes in general position. Since o 0 is arbitrary, we get that c a1, F1 c a2, F2 c a1 a2, F1 F2 0 , which completes the proof of Theorem 5.2 in full generality. 6 Stable non displaceability of heavy sets In this section we prove part ii of Theorem 1.2. Proposition 6.1. Every heavy subset is stably non displaceable. 57 For the proof we shall need the following auxiliary statement. Given , consider the torus T2 R obtained as the quotient of the cylinder T r S1 mod 1 by the shift r, 7 r R, . For 0 define the function F r, f r on T2 R, where f r is any R periodic function having only two non degenerate critical points on 0, R a maximum point at 1, and a minimum point at , f R 2 0. We denote by T the fundamental class of T2 R. We work with the symplectic form dr d on T2 R. Lemma 6.2. c T , F . Proof. Note that the contractible closed orbits of period 1 of the Hamiltonian flow generated by F are fixed points forming circles S and . The actions of the fixed points on S equal respectively to and , and thus the spectral invariants of F lie in the set . Recall from that c T , F c point , F . Thus c T , F . Lemma 6.3.

Chunk: so that the set H 1 max H o , max H is displaceable. Choose a real valued cut offfunction R which equals 1 near max H and which is supported in max H o , max H o . Thus H is supported in H 1 max H o max H and H 0. Since H and H Poisson commute, the vanishing and the monotonicity axioms yield H H H H max H H max H .

Lemma 6.2 also yields a simple proof of the following result which also follows from Corollary 1.15 Corollary 6.4. Any meridian of T2 is heavy with respect to the fundamental class T . Proof. In the notation as above identify T2 with T2 1 for . Since any two meridians of T2 can be mapped into each other by a symplectic isotopy and since such an isotopy preserves heaviness, it suffices to prove that the meridian S S see the proof of Lemma 6.2 is heavy. Let H T2 R be a Hamiltonian and let us show that H infS H, where is defined using T . Shifting H, if necessary, by a constant, we may assume without loss of generality that infS . Pick r T2 R as in the definition of F so that note that f equals 1 on S . Then Lemma 6.2 yields H F1 . 7 Analyzing stable stems Proof of Theorem 1.6 Assume that A is a Poisson commutative subspace of C M , M A its moment map with the image , and let 1 p be a stable stem of A. Take any function H C A with H 0 and H p 0. We claim that H 0. By an arbitrarily small C0 perturbation of H we can assume 59 that , say U, of p. Choose an open covering U0, U1, . . . , UN of so that , and all 1 Ui are stably displaceable for i 1 it exists by the definition of a stem . Let i R, , . . ., N, be a partition of unity subordinated to the covering . Take the two torus T2 R as in Section 6. Choose 1 Ui is displaceable in M T2 R for all i 1. Choose now a sufficiently fine covering Vj, , . . ., K, of the torus T2 R by sufficiently thin annuli so that the sets 1 Ui Vj are displaceable in M T2 R for all i 1 and all j. Let j r , , . . . , K, be a partition of unity subordinated to the covering . Denote by the partial quasi state corresponding to a T. Put F r, cos 2 r R . Write H 0 K X H F i H 0 F 0 N X 1 H F i j . Note that H 0 1. Applying partial quasi additivity and monotonicity we get that H F F 0 1. By Lemma 6.2 and the product formula Theorem 5.1 above we have H F H 1 1 and hence H 0. On the other hand, H 0 since

Chunk: Theorem 1.25 a Assume that L1, . . . , Lm are pair wise disjoint Lagrangian submanifolds satisfying the condition a from the formulation of the theorem. Denote by Ni the minimal Maslov number of Li. Since , the class of a point from H0 Li F is an Albers element for Li. Let Zi QH 0 M be its image under the Biran Cornea inclusion morphism associated to Li. Note that by Proposition 8.1 i , where Ni 2qNi 2, ai HNi M F and p H0 M F is the homology class of a point. Observe that deg n 1, and hence the expression for Zi cannot contain terms in w 1 i of order two and higher, since HkNi M F 0 for k 2. Recall now that all Ni s lie in some set Y of positive integers. Let W QH 0 M be the span over K of H0 M F M E Y s E 2q E 2 HE M F . Note that dimK Y M . Thus the elements Zi, , . . . , m, are linearly dependent over K . By Theorem 8.2, QH2n M is not semi simple. Proof of Theorem 1.25 b Assume that L1, . . . , Lm are pair wise disjoint homologically non trivial Lagrangian submanifolds. By Proposition 8.1 ii jq Li j Li for every , . . . , m. Since the classes j Li are linearly dependent, Theorem 8.2 implies that QH2n M is not semi simple. Proof of Theorem 1.18 Combining Proposition 8.1 ii and iii we get that for any H C M c j L , H sup L H H C M . 64 By the hypothesis of the theorem, we can write j L . Then c a, H c j L b, H c j L , H c b, 0 . Thus c a, H sup L H c b, 0 . Applying this inequality to E H with , dividing by E and passing to the limit as E we get that H supL H for all H. Thus L is superheavy. Remark 8.3. The results above admit the following generalizations in the framework of the Biran Cornea theory. The main object of this theory is the quantum homology ring QH L of a monotone Lagrangian submanifold, which is isomorphic to the Lagrangian Floer homology HF L, L of L up to a shift of the grading. i If QH L does not vanish then L is heavy see Remark 1.2.9b in . In fact, it follows from that if L satisfies the Albers condition, QH L does not vanish. ii The map jq of the Proposition 8.1 above is a footprint of the quan tum inclusion map iL QH L QH M constructed in . The analogue of the action estimate in item iii of the proposition is ob tained in for the classes iL x for elements x QH L of a certain special form, yielding the following generalization of Theorem 1.18 for these special classes x QH L the condition that the class iL x does not vanish and divides a non trivial idempotent a implies that L is superheavy with respect to a. This enables, for instance, to general ize Example 1.19 on Lagrangian spheres in quadrics above to the case when dim L is odd. iii In one can find another action estimate which comes from the QH M module structure on QH L , which yields more results on super heaviness of monotone Lagrangian submanifolds. Proof of Proposition 1.4 The quantum homology QH2n M splits as an algebra over K into a direct sum of two algebras one of which is a field. This was proved by McDufffor the field see and 24, Section 7 , but 65 the proof goes through for the case . Denote the

The answers to these queries were found:

1. Lagrangian submanifolds and quantum homology are related in the context in that the quantum homology ring QH L of a monotone Lagrangian submanifold L is isomorphic to the Lagrangian Floer homology HF L L of L up to a shift of the grading. The theorem 1.25 assumes that L1, . . . , Lm are pair wise disjoint Lagrangian submanifolds, and works with the minimal Maslov number Ni of Li, and the image of the Biran Cornea inclusion morphism associated to Li.

Chunk: D2 bu is bounded by the difference R 1 0 b 0 R 1 0 b . Since, 0 and are o close in the C metric the later difference can be made less than 1 if we choose a sufficiently small o . Thus we have shown that by choosing a sufficiently small o we can bound AF 0, u0 AG , u by 1. Now, as far as the Conley Zehnder indices are concerned, our choice of the trivializations means that the difference between CZF 0, u0 and CZG , u is just the difference between the Conley Zehnder indices for the matrix paths t 7 A t and t 7 B t . But the latter paths in Sp 2n are o close in the C sense, hence represent close elements of Sp 2n and if o was chosen sufficiently small, then, as we mentioned in Section 3.3, their Conley Zehnder indices differ at most by a constant depending only on n. This finishes the proof of the claim and the proposition. 71 Plan of the proof of Proposition 9.1 We assume now that H is a fixed strictly convex function on R. Our calculations will feature E as a large parameter. For quantities , depending on E we will write if const holds for large enough E, where const depends only on M, , and H, and in particular does not depend on E. We will write if and . Using this language the proposition can be restated as c a, EH E H pspec . In general, 1 periodic orbits of the flow of EH are not isolated and there fore the Hamiltonian is not regular. Let F be a regular time periodic perturbation of EH. By the spectrality axiom, the spectral number c a, F for a QH2n M equals AF 0, u0 for some pair 0, u0 ePF with CZF 0, u0 2n. Thus c a, F DF 0 . Combining this with Proposition 9.3 we get that for some PEH E H pspec c a, EH c a, F DF 0 DEH . Thus it would be enough to show that DEH E H pspec for all PEH , which together with would imply . Inequality will be proved in the following way. Note that each PEH lies in 1 p for some p . We will show that DEH E H p E H p pspec p . Note that implies . Indeed, since H is strictly convex and reaches its minimum at pspec, it follows from that DEH E H p E H p pspec p E H pspec , which is true for any PEH thus yielding . Proof of Let the T1 action on M be given by a loop of sym plectomorphisms , t R, t 1. The flow of EH has the form E H x tx. We view as a map M satisfying . Denote x . The curve lies in 1 p . 72 Denote N . This is the T1 orbit of x and it is either a point or a circle. In the first case is a constant trajectory concentrated at a fixed point N M of the action. Using this constant curve together with the constant disc u spanning for the definitions of I and DEH one gets pspec , u 2, and DEH E H p 2 CZEH , u . Thus proving reduces in this case to proving CZEH , u E H p m , u . Let us fix a symplectic basis of TNM and view each differential dN t as a symplectic matrix A t , so that is an identity based loop in Sp 2n . Then CZEH , u CZmatr , while E H p m , u E H p Maslov .

Chunk: in . These are cer tain real valued functionals on C M with rich algebraic properties which are constructed by means of the Hamiltonian Floer theory and which conve niently encode a part of the information contained in this theory. In general, the definition of a partial symplectic quasi state involves the choice of an 7 idempotent element in the commutative part QH M of the quantum ho mology algebra of M. Though the default choice is just the unity of the algebra, there exist some other meaningful choices, in particular in the case when QH M is semi simple. This gives rise to another theme discussed in this paper visible topological obstructions to semi simplicity see Corol lary 1.24 and Theorem 1.25 below . For instance, we shall show that if a monotone symplectic manifold M contains too many disjoint monotone Lagrangian spheres whose minimal Maslov numbers exceed n 1, the quan tum homology QH M cannot be semi simple. Let us pass to the precise set up. For the reader s convenience, the ma terial presented in this brief outline will be repeated in parts in the next sections in a less compressed form. 1.2 Preliminaries on quantum homology The Novikov Ring Let F denote a base field which in our case will be either C or Z2, and let R be a countable subgroup with respect to the addition . Let s, q be formal variables. Define a field K whose elements are generalized Laurent series in s of the following form K X z s , z F, c z , c R . Define a ring K q, q 1 as the ring of polynomials in q, q 1 with coefficients in K . We turn into a graded ring by setting the degree of s to be 0 and the degree of q to be 2. The ring serves as an abstract model of the Novikov ring associated to a symplectic manifold. Let M, be a closed connected symplectic manifold. Denote by HS 2 M the subgroup of spherical homology classes in the integral homology group H2 M Z . Abusing the notation we will write A , c1 A for the results of evaluation of the cohomology classes and c1 M on A H2 M Z . Set 2 M HS 2 M , where by definition A B iff A B and c1 A c1 B . 8 Denote by M, HS 2 M R the subgroup of periods of the symplectic form on M on spherical homology classes. By definition, the Novikov ring of a symplectic manifold M, is M, . In what follows, when M, is fixed, we abbreviate and write , K and instead of M, , K M, and M, respectively. Quantum homology Set . The quantum homology QH M is defined as follows. First, it is a graded module over given by QH M H M F F , with the grading defined by the gradings on H M F and deg a zs qk deg a 2k . Second, and most important, QH M is equipped with a quantum prod uct if a Hk M F , b Hl M F , their quantum product is a class a b QHk l 2n M , defined by a 2 M a b A s A q c1 A , where a b A Hk l 2n 2c1 A M is defined by the requirement a b A a, b, c c H M F . Here stands for the intersection index and GW F A a, b, c F denotes the Gromov Witten invariant which, roughly speaking, counts the number of pseudo holomorphic spheres in M in the class A that meet cycles representing a, b, c H M F see , , for the precise definition .

Chunk: QH M one gets a correctly defined graded commutative associative product operation on QH M which is a deformation of the classical product in singular ho mology , , , , . The quantum homology algebra QH M is a ring whose unity is the fundamental class M and which is a module of finite rank over . If a, b QH M have graded degrees deg a , deg b then deg a b deg a deg b 2n. We will be mostly interested in the commutative part of the quantum homology ring which in the case , of course, the whole quantum homology ring . For this purpose we introduce the following notation 9 We denote by QH M the whole quantum homology QH M if M if . In general, given a topological space X, we denote by H X F the whole singular homology group H X F if X F if . Thus, in our notation the ring QH M H M F F is always a com mutative subring with unity of QH M and a module of finite rank over . We will identify with a subring of QH M by 7 M . 1.3 An hierarchy of rigid subsets within Floer theory Fix a non zero idempotent a QH2n M by obvious grading considera tions the degree of every idempotent equals 2n . We shall deal with spectral invariants c a, H , where M R, t R, is a smooth time dependent and 1 periodic in time Hamiltonian function on M, or c a, H , where H is an element of the universal cover Ham M of Ham M rep resented by an identity based path given by the time 1 Hamiltonian flow generated by H. If H is normalized, meaning that R M Ht dim M , then c a, H c a, H . These invariants, which nowadays are standard objects of the Floer theory, were introduced in cf. in the aspherical case also see , for an earlier version of the construction and for a summary of definitions and results in the monotone case . Disclaimer Throughout the paper we tacitly assume that M, as well as M T2, , when we speak of stable displaceability belongs to the class S of closed symplectic manifolds for which the spectral invariants are well defined and enjoy the standard list of properties see e.g. 41, Theorem 12.4.4 . For instance, S contains all symplectically aspherical and spherically monotone manifolds. Furthermore, S contains all symplectic manifolds M2n for which, on one hand, either on HS 2 M is at least n 1 and, on the other hand, HS 2 M is a discrete subgroup of R cf. . The general belief is that the class S includes all symplectic manifolds. Define a functional C M R by H lim l c a, lH l 10 It is shown in that the functional has some very special algebraic properties see Theorem 3.6 which form the axioms of a partial symplectic quasi state introduced in . The next definition is motivated in part by the work of Albers . Definition 1.1. A closed subset X M is called heavy with respect to or with respect to a used to define if H inf X H H C M , and is called superheavy with respect to or a if H sup X H H C M . The default choice of an idempotent a is the unity M QH M . In this case, as we shall see below, the collections of heavy and superheavy sets satisfy the properties listed in Section 1.1 and include the examples therein. In view of potential applications including geometric obstructions to semi simplicity of the quantum homology , we shall work, whenever possible, with general idempotents.

Chunk: called the special fiber, explicitly in the case when M, is spherically monotone HS 2 M c1 TM HS 2 M , 0 . The special fiber can be described via the mixed action Maslov homomor phism introduced in Let M2n, be a spherically monotone symplectic manifold, and let , t , be any loop of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, with 1, generated by a 1 periodic normalized Hamiltonian func tion F x, t . The orbits of any Hamiltonian loop are contractible due to the standard Floer theory1. Pick any point x M and any disc u D2 M spanning the orbit . Define the action2 of the orbit by AF , u Z 1 0 F t , t dt Z D2 u . Trivialize the symplectic vector bundle u TM over D2 and denote by mF , u the Maslov index of the loop of symplectic matrices corresponding to with respect to the chosen trivialization. One readily checks that, in view of the spherical monotonicity, the quantity I F AF , u 2mF , u does not depend on the choice of the point x and the disc u, and is invariant under homotopies of the Hamiltonian loop . In fact, I is a well defined homomorphism from 1 Ham M to R see , . Assume again that Tk Ham M, is a Hamiltonian torus ac tion. Write for the induced homomorphism of the fundamental groups. Since the target space Rk of the moment map is naturally identified with Hom 1 Tk , R , the pull back I of the mixed action Maslov homomor phism with the reversed sign can be considered as a point of Rk. We call it a special point and denote by pspec. The preimage 1 pspec is called the special fiber of the moment map. In the case , when is a real valued function on M, we will call pspec the special value of . 1The Floer theory guarantees the existence of at least one contractible periodic orbit this is not obvious a priori if is not an autonomous flow. Since all the orbits of are homotopic, all of them are contractible. 2Note that our action functional and the one in are of opposite signs. 15 If , then pspec can be defined in purely combinatorial terms involving only the polytope . Namely, pick a vertex x of . Since in this case is a Delzant polytope , there is a unique up to a permutation choice of vectors v1, . . . , vn which originate at x span the n rays containing the edges of adjacent to x form a basis of Zn over Z.

Let x M be the fixed point corre sponding to the vertex x1, . . . , xn . Then the vectors v1 j, . . . , vn j , , . . . , n, are simply the weights of the isotropy Tn action on TxM. Since the definition of the mixed action Maslov invariant of a Hamiltonian circle action does not depend on the choice of a 1 periodic orbit and a disc span ning it, let us compute all Ii, , . . . , n, using the constant periodic orbit concentrated at the fixed point x and the constant disc u spanning it.

Chunk: rescattering amounts to elastic qqi qi scattering, the effective energy loss is essentially elastic energy loss as shown in Ref. . There is, however, LPM suppression due to partial cancellation by single triple interference contributions. For long formation time, 1 xLp RA, the cancellation is complete.

Chunk: of mixing between quark and gluon fragmentation functions. Their contributions generally have the form, CF Nc 2 sxB Q2 X qi Z dl2 T l2 T 1 Z zh dz z Dqi h zh z Dg h zh z Pqqi qqi z T A SI qqi x, xL f A q x , where again the summation over the quark flavor includes , q. This mixing does not occur on the probability but rather on on the amplitude level since it involves in terferences between single and triple scattering. Therefore, this contribution depends on the difference between gluon and quark fragmentation functions Eq. and can be positive or negative in different region of zh. Nevertheless, they contribute to the mod ification of the effective quark fragmentation function and the flavor dependence of the final hadron spectra. 6 Flavor dependence of the medium modified fragmentation Summing all contributions to quark quark antiquark double scattering as listed in Sec tion 4, we can express the total twist four correction up to O 2 s to the quark fragmen tation function as Dq h zh CF Nc 2 sxB Q2 2 Dg h zh Dq h zh T A H q q x, 0 f A q x s 2 Z dl2 T l2 T 1 Z zh dz z X a,b,i Db h zh z P i qa b z T A i qa x, xL f A q x , 25 where the summation is over all possible q a b X processes and all different matrix elements T A i qa x, xL , SI, I, I2 , which will be four basic matrix elements we will use. The effective splitting functions P i qa b z are listed in Appendix A 2. One should also include virtual corrections which can be constructed from the real corrections through unitarity constraints . Similarly, we can also write down the twist four corrections to antiquark fragmentation in a nuclear medium, D q h zh CF Nc 2 sxB Q2 2 Dg h zh D q h zh T A H qq x, 0 f A q x s 2 Z dl2 T l2 T 1 Z zh dz z X a,b,i Db h zh z P i qa b z T A i qa x, xL f A q x , where the matrix elements T A i qa x, xL and the effective splitting functions P i qa b z can be obtained from the corresponding ones for quarks. Given a model for the two quark correlation functions, one will be able to use the above expressions to numerically evaluate twist four corrections to the quark antiquark fragmentation functions. In this paper, we will instead give a qualitative estimate of the flavor dependence of the correction in DIS offa large nucleus. For the purpose of a qualitative estimate, one can assume that all the twist four two quark correlation functions can be factorized, as has been done in Refs. , Z p dy 2 dy 1 dy 2 eix1p y ix2p y 1 y 2 y 2 y y 1 A q 2 q y qi y 1 2 qi y 2 A C xA f A q x1 f N qi x2 , Z p dy 2 dy 1 dy 2 eix1p y ix2p y 1 y 2 ixLp y 2 y 2 y y 1 A q 2 q y qi y 1 2 qi y 2 A C xA f A q x1 f N qi x2 e x2 L x2 A , where , mN is the nucleon mass, RA the nucleus size, f N qi x2 is the antiquark distribution in a nucleon and C is assumed to be a constant, parameterizing the strength of two parton correlations inside a nucleus.

Chunk: nuclear modification of the leading hadron spectra in semi inclusive deeply inelastic lepton nucleus scattering observed by the HERMES experiment . The same framework also gives a compelling explanation for the suppression of large transverse momentum hadrons discovered at RHIC . The emphasis of recent studies of medium modification of fragmentation functions has been on radiative parton energy loss induced by multiple scattering with gluons. Such processes indeed are dominant relative to multiple scattering with quarks because of the abundance of soft gluons in either cold nuclei or hot dense matter produced in heavy ion collisions. Since gluon bremsstrahlung induced by scattering with medium gluons is the same for quarks and anti quarks, one also expects the energy loss and fragmentation modification to be identical for quarks and anti quarks. However, in a medium with fi nite baryon density such as cold nuclei and the forward region of heavy ion collisions, the difference between quark and anti quark distributions in the medium should lead to differ ent energy loss and modified fragmentation functions for quarks and antiquarks through 2 quark antiquark annihilation processes. To study such an asymmetry, one must consider systematically all possible quark quark and quark antiquark scattering processes, which will be the focus of this paper. In this study we will calculate the modifications of quark and antiquark fragmentation functions FF due to quark quark antiquark double scattering in a nuclear medium, working within the LQS framework for generalized factorization in perturbative QCD. For a complete description of nuclear modification of the single inclusive hadron spec tra, one still have to consider medium modification of gluon fragmentation functions in addition to modified quark fragmentation function due to quark gluon scattering . The theoretical results presented in this paper will be a second step toward a complete description of medium modified fragmentation functions. However, one can already find that quark quark antiquark double scattering will give different corrections to quark and antiquark FF, depending on antiquark and quark density of the medium, respec tively. This difference between modified quark and antiquark FF may shed light on the interesting observation by the HERMES experiment of a large difference between nuclear suppression of the leading proton and antiproton spectra in semi inclusive DIS offlarge nuclei. Such a picture of quark quark antiquark scattering can provide a com peting mechanism for the experimentally observed phenomenon in addition to possible absorption of final state hadrons inside nuclear matter . The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we will present the general for malism of our calculation including the generalized factorization of twist 4 processes. In Section III we will illustrate the procedure of calculating the hard partonic parts of quark quark double scattering in nuclei. In Section IV we will discuss the modifications to quark and antiquark fragmentation functions due to quark quark antiquark dou ble scattering in nuclei. In Section V, we will focus on the flavor dependent part of the medium modification to the quark FF s due to quark antiquark annihilation and we will discuss the implications for the flavor dependence of the leading hadron spectra in both DIS offa nucleus and heavy ion collisions. We will summarize our work in Section VI. In the Appendix A 1, we collect the complete results for the hard partonic parts for different cut diagrams of quark quark antiquark double rescattering in nuclei. We also provide an alternative calculation of the hard parts of the central cut diagrams in Appendix A 3 through elastic quark quark scattering or quark antiquark annihilation as a cross check. 2 General formalism In order to study quark and antiquark FF s in semi inclusive deeply inelastic lepton nucleus scattering, we consider the following processes, e L1 A p e L2 h lh X , 3 Ap Ap Fig. 1.

Chunk: can be categorized into contributions from double hard, hard soft processes and their interferences. The double hard rescatterings correspond to elastic scattering of the lead ing quark with another medium quark. It requires the second quark to carry a finite fractional momentum xL. Therefore, the energy loss of the leading quark through such processes can be identified as elastic energy loss at order O 2 s . The quark energy loss and modification of quark fragmentation functions are dominated by the t channel of quark quark antiquark scattering and are shown to be similar to that caused by quark gluon scattering. The contribution from quark quark scattering is smaller than that from quark gluon scattering by a factor of CF CA times the ratio of quark and gluon distribu tion functions in the medium. We have shown that such contributions are not negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The soft hard rescatterings mix gluon and quark scattering, in the same way as the lowest order q q g processes. Such processes modifies the final hadron spectra or effective fragmentation functions but do not con tribute to energy loss of the leading quark. For q q q q, gg processes, there also exist pure interference contributions mainly coming from single triple scattering interference. With a simple model of a factorized two quark correlation functions, we further investi 31 gated the flavor dependence of the medium modified quark fragmentation functions in a large nucleus. We identified the flavor dependent part of the modification and find that the nuclear modification for an antiquark fragmentation into a valence hadron is larger than that of a quark. This offers an qualitative explanation for the flavor dependence of the leading hadron suppression in semi inclusive DIS offnuclear targets as observed by the HERMES experiment .

Chunk: to x using this same procedure. Finally, slide pebbles along the path from the original endpoints v to u specified by the successor array s v , s s v , ... The correctness of Algorithm 18 comes from the fact that it is implementing the shortcut construction. Efficiency comes from the fact that instead of potentially moving the pebble back and forth, Algorithm 18 pre computes a canonical path crossing each edge of H at most three times once in the initial depth first search, and twice while converting the initial path to a canonical one. It follows that each accepted edges takes O n time, for a total of O n2 time spent processing edges in H. Although we have not discussed this explicity, for the algorithm to be efficient we need to maintain components as in . After each accepted edge, the components of H can be updated in time O n . Finally, the results of show that the rejected edges take an amortized O time each. 16 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Summarizing, we have shown that the canonical pebble game with colors solves the decom position problem in time O n2 . 9. An important special case Rigidity in dimension 2 and slider pinning In this short section we present a new application for the special case of practical importance, , . As discussed in the introduction, Laman s theorem characterizes minimally rigid graphs as the 2,3 tight graphs. In recent work on slider pinning, developed after the current paper was submitted, we introduced the slider pinning model of rigidity . Com binatorially, we model the bar slider frameworks as simple graphs together with some loops placed on their vertices in such a way that there are no more than 2 loops per vertex, one of each color. We characterize the minimally rigid bar slider graphs as graphs that are 1. 2,3 sparse for subgraphs containing no loops. 2. 2,0 tight when loops are included. We call these graphs 2,0,3 graded tight, and they are a special case of the graded sparse graphs studied in our paper . The connection with the pebble games in this paper is the following. Corollary 19 Pebble games and slider pinning . In any 2,3 pebble game graph, if we replace pebbles by loops, we obtain a 2,0,3 graded tight graph. Proof. Follows from invariant I3 of Lemma 7. In , we study a special case of slider pinning where every slider is either vertical or horizontal. We model the sliders as pre colored loops, with the color indicating x or y direction. For this axis parallel slider case, the minimally rigid graphs are characterized by 1. 2,3 sparse for subgraphs containing no loops. 2. Admit a 2 coloring of the edges so that each color is a forest i.e., has no cycles , and each monochromatic tree spans exactly one loop of its color. This also has an interpretation in terms of colored pebble games. Corollary 20 The pebble game with colors and slider pinning . In any canonical 2,3 pebble game with colors graph, if we replace pebbles by loops of the same color, we obtain the graph of a minimally pinned axis parallel bar slider framework. Proof. Follows from Theorem 4, and Lemma 12. 10. Conclusions and open problems We presented a new characterization of k,l sparse graphs, the pebble game with colors, and used it to give an efficient algorithm for finding decompositions of sparse graphs into edge disjoint trees. Our algorithm finds such sparsity certifying decompositions in the upper range and runs in time O n2 , which is as fast as the algorithms for recognizing sparse graphs in the upper range from . We also used the pebble game with colors to describe a new sparsity certifying decomposi tion that applies to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions

Chunk: w. It follows that any sparse graph has a pebble game construction. Theorem 1 Sparse graphs and pebble game graphs coincide . A graph G is k,l sparse with 0 l 2k 1 if and only if G is a pebble game graph. 6. The pebble game with colors decomposition In this section we prove Theorem 2, which characterizes all pebble game decompositions. We start with the following lemmas about the structure of monochromatic connected components in H, the directed graph maintained during the pebble game. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions 9 Lemma 10 Monochromatic pebble game subgraphs are 1,0 sparse . Let Hi be the sub graph of H induced by edges with pebbles of color ci on them. Then Hi is 1,0 sparse, for ,...,k. Proof. By I4 Hi is a set of edges with out degree at most one for every vertex. Lemma 11 Tree pieces in a pebble game graph . Every subgraph of the directed graph H in a pebble game construction contains at least lmonochromatic tree pieces, and each of these is rooted at either a vertex with a pebble on it or a vertex that is the tail of an out edge. Recall that an out edge from a subgraph H V ,E is an edge vw with v V and vw E . Proof. Let H V ,E be a non empty subgraph of H, and assume without loss of generality that H is induced by V . By I3 , out V peb V l. We will show that each pebble and out edge tail is the root of a tree piece. Consider a vertex v V and a color ci. By I4 there is a unique monochromatic directed path of color ci starting at v. By I5 , if this path ends at a pebble, it does not have a cycle. Similarly, if this path reaches a vertex that is the tail of an out edge also in color ci i.e., if the monochromatic path from v leaves V , then the path cannot have a cycle in H . Since this argument works for any vertex in any color, for each color there is a partitioning of the vertices into those that can reach each pebble, out edge tail, or cycle. It follows that each pebble and out edge tail is the root of a monochromatic tree, as desired. Applied to the whole graph Lemma 11 gives us the following. Lemma 12 Pebbles are the roots of trees . In any pebble game configuration, each pebble of color ci is the root of a possibly empty monochromatic tree piece of color ci. Remark Haas showed in that in a lTk , a subgraph induced by n 2 vertices with m edges has exactly kn m tree pieces in it. Lemma 11 strengthens Haas result by extending it to the lower range and giving a construction that finds the tree pieces, showing the connection between the l 1 pebble condition and the hereditary condition on proper lTk . We conclude our investigation of arbitrary pebble game constructions with a description of the decomposition induced by the pebble game with colors. Theorem 2 The pebble game with colors decomposition . A graph G is a pebble game graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge disjoint subgraphs such that each is 1,0 sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ltree pieces of the 1,0 sparse graphs in the decomposition. Proof. Let G be a pebble game graph. The existence of the k edge disjoint 1,0 sparse sub graphs was shown in Lemma 10, and Lemma 11 proves the condition on subgraphs. For the other direction, we observe that a color ci with ti tree pieces in a given subgraph can span at most n ti edges summing over all the colors shows that a graph with

Chunk: a pebble game decomposition must be sparse. Apply Theorem 1 to complete the proof. Remark We observe that a pebble game decomposition for a Laman graph may be read out of the bipartite matching used in Hendrickson s Laman graph extraction algorithm . Indeed, pebble game orientations have a natural correspondence with the bipartite matchings used in . 10 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Maps and trees are a special case of pebble game decompositions for tight graphs if there are no cycles in lof the colors, then the trees rooted at the corresponding lpebbles must be spanning, since they have n 1 edges. Also, if each color forms a forest in an upper range pebble game decomposition, then the tree pieces condition ensures that the pebble game de composition is a proper lTk. In the next section, we show that the pebble game can be specialized to correspond to maps and trees and proper lTk decompositions. 7. Canonical Pebble Game Constructions In this section we prove the main theorems Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 , continuing the inves tigation of decompositions induced by pebble game constructions by studying the case where a minimum number of monochromatic cycles are created. The main idea, captured in Lemma 15 and illustrated in Figure 6, is to avoid creating cycles while collecting pebbles. We show that this is always possible, implying that monochromatic map graphs are created only when we add more than k n 1 edges to some set of n vertices. For the lower range, this implies that every color is a forest. Every decomposition characterization of tight graphs discussed above follows immediately from the main theorem, giving new proofs of the previous results in a unified framework. In the proof, we will use two specializations of the pebble game moves. The first is a modi fication of the add edge move. Canonical add edge When performing an add edge move, cover the new edge with a color that is on both vertices if possible. If not, then take the highest numbered color present. The second is a restriction on which pebble slide moves we allow. Canonical pebble slide A pebble slide move is allowed only when it does not create a monochromatic cycle. We call a pebble game construction that uses only these moves canonical. In this section we will show that every pebble game graph has a canonical pebble game construction Lemma 14 and Lemma 15 and that canonical pebble game constructions correspond to proper lTk and maps and trees decompositions Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 . We begin with a technical lemma that motivates the definition of canonical pebble game constructions. It shows that the situations disallowed by the canonical moves are all the ways for cycles to form in the lowest lcolors. Lemma 13 Monochromatic cycle creation . Let v V have a pebble p of color ci on it and let w be a vertex in the same tree of color ci as v. A monochromatic cycle colored ci is created in exactly one of the following ways M1 The edge vw is added with an add edge move. M2 The edge wv is reversed by a pebble slide move and the pebble p is used to cover the reverse edge vw. Proof. Observe that the preconditions in the statement of the lemma are implied by Lemma 7. By Lemma 12 monochromatic cycles form when the last pebble of color ci is removed from a connected monochromatic subgraph. M1 and M2 are the only ways to do this in a pebble game construction, since the color of an edge only changes when it is inserted the first time or a new pebble is put on it by a pebble slide move.

Chunk: is anomalously high because the tidal force is close to a resonance in the response function of ocean Brush 1983 . Kagan gave a detailed review about those tidal friction models Kagan 1997 . Those models are based on many assumptions about geological continental position and drifting and physical conditions in the past, and many parameters such as phase lag angle, multi mode approximation with time dependent frequencies of the resonance modes, etc. have to be introduced and carefully adjusted to make their predictions close to the geological evidence. However, those assumptions and parameters are still challenged, to certain extent, as concoction. The second possible scenario is that another mechanism could dominate the evolution of the Earth Moon system and the role of the tidal friction is not significant. In the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society, University of California at Riverside, the author proposed a dark matter field fluid model Pan 2005 with a non Newtonian approach, the current Moon and Earth data agree with this model very well. This paper will demonstrate that the past evolution of Moon Earth system can be described by the dark matter field fluid model without any assumptions 3 about past geological and physical conditions. Although the subject of the evolution of the Earth Moon system has been extensively studied analytically or numerically, to the author s knowledge, there are no theories similar or equivalent to this model. 2. Invisible matter In modern cosmology, it was proposed that the visible matter in the universe is about 2 10 of the total matter and about 90 98 of total matter is currently invisible which is called dark matter and dark energy, such invisible matter has an anti gravity property to make the universe expanding faster and faster. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, the evolution of the universe should be dominated by the physical mechanism of such invisible matter, such physical mechanism could be far beyond the current Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics, and the Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics could reflect only a corner of the iceberg of the greater physics. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, it should be more reasonable to think that such dominant invisible matter spreads in everywhere of the universe the density of the invisible matter may vary from place to place in other words, all visible matter objects should be surrounded by such invisible matter and the motion of the visible matter objects should be affected by the invisible matter if there are interactions between the visible matter and the invisible matter. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, the size of the particles of the invisible matter should be very small and below the 4 detection limit of the current technology otherwise, it would be detected long time ago with such dominant amount. With such invisible matter in mind, we move to the next section to develop the dark matter field fluid model with non Newtonian approach. For simplicity, all invisible matter dark matter, dark energy and possible other terms is called dark matter here. 3. The dark matter field fluid model In this proposed model, it is assumed that 1. A celestial body rotates and moves in the space, which, for simplicity, is uniformly filled with the dark matter which is in quiescent state relative to the motion of the celestial body. The dark matter possesses a field property and a fluid property it can interact with the celestial body with its fluid and field properties therefore, it can have energy exchange with the celestial body, and affect the motion of the celestial body. 2. The fluid property follows the general principle of fluid mechanics. The dark matter field fluid particles

Chunk: may be so small that they can easily permeate into ordinary baryonic matter i. e., ordinary matter objects could be saturated with such dark matter field fluid. Thus, the whole celestial body interacts with the dark matter field fluid, in the manner of a sponge moving thru water. The nature of the field property of the dark matter field fluid is unknown. It is here assumed that the interaction of the field associated with the dark matter field fluid with the celestial body is proportional to the mass of the celestial body. The dark matter field fluid is assumed to have a repulsive force against the gravitational force towards baryonic matter. The nature and mechanism of such repulsive force is unknown. 5 With the assumptions above, one can study how the dark matter field fluid may influence the motion of a celestial body and compare the results with observations. The common shape of celestial bodies is spherical. According to Stokes s law, a rigid non permeable sphere moving through a quiescent fluid with a sufficiently low Reynolds number experiences a resistance force F rv F , r is the radius of the sphere, and is the fluid viscosity constant. The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 1 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. For a rigid sphere moving through the dark matter field fluid, due to the dual properties of the dark matter field fluid and its permeation into the sphere, the force F may not be proportional to the radius of the sphere. Also, F may be proportional to the mass of the sphere due to the field interaction. Therefore, with the combined effects of both fluid and field, the force exerted on the sphere by the dark matter field fluid is assumed to be of the scaled form mv r F where n is a parameter arising from saturation by dark matter field fluid, the r1 n can be viewed as the effective radius with the same unit as r, m is the mass of the sphere, and is the dark matter field fluid constant, which is equivalent to . The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 2 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. The force described by Eq. 2 is velocity dependent and causes negative acceleration. According to Newton s second law of motion, the equation of motion for the sphere is mv r dt dv m Then 6 exp 1 0 vt r v v 6 where v0 is the initial velocity of the sphere. If the sphere revolves around a massive gravitational center, there are three forces in the line between the sphere and the gravitational center the gravitational force, the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force of the dark matter field fluid. The drag force in Eq. 3 reduces the orbital velocity and causes the sphere to move inward to the gravitational center. However, if the sum of the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force is stronger than the gravitational force, then, the sphere will move outward and recede from the gravitational center. This is the case of interest here. If the velocity change in Eq. 3 is sufficiently slow and the repulsive force is small compared to the gravitational force and centripetal acceleration force, then the rate of receding will be accordingly relatively slow. Therefore, the gravitational force and the centripetal acceleration force can be approximately treated in equilibrium at any time. The pseudo equilibrium equation is R mv R GMm 2 , M is the mass of the gravitational center, and R is the radius of the orbit. Inserting v of Eq. 4 into Eq. 5 yields 12 exp 1 2 0 t r v GM R or 12 exp 1 0 t r R R where 2 0 0 v GM . Note that R exponentially increases with time.

Chunk: the following recurrence relation for the number ak n 2 of acyclic automata of size n on a k letter input alphabet k 1 ak n n 1 X 1 n j 1 n j j 1 k n j ak j , n 1. A source is a vertex with no incoming edges. A finite acyclic automaton has at least one source because a path traversed backward v1 v2 v3 . . . must have distinct vertices and so cannot continue indefinitely. An automaton is single source or initially connected if it has only one source. Let Bk n denote the set of single source acyclic finite SAF automata on a k letter input alphabet with vertices 1, 2, . . ., n 1 where 1 is the source and n 1 is the sink, and set bk n Bk n . The two line representation of an automaton in Bk n is the 2 kn matrix whose columns list the edges in order. For example, ! is in B3 and the source to sink paths in B include 1 a 2 a 6, 1 b 4 c 3 a 6, 1 b 4 b 5 b 2 b 6, where the alphabet is . Proposition 1. The number bk n of SAF automata of size n on a k letter input alphabet n, k 1 is given by bk n n X 1 n i n 1 i 1 i 1 k n i ak i Remark This formula is a bit more succinct than the the recurrence in 1, Theorem 3.2 . Proof Consider the set A of acyclic automata with transient vertices n in which 1 is a source. Call 2, 3, . . ., n the interior vertices. For X 2, n , let f X automata in A whose set of interior vertices includes X, g X automata in A whose set of interior vertices is precisely X. Then f X P Y X Y 2,n g Y and by M obius inversion on the lattice of subsets of 2, n , g X P Y X Y 2,n X, Y f Y where X, Y is the M obius function for this 3 lattice. Since X, Y 1 Y X if X Y , we have in particular that g X Y 2,n 1 Y f Y . Let Y n i so that 1 i n. When Y consists entirely of sources, the vertices in n 1 Y and their incident edges form a subautomaton with i transient states there are ak i such. Also, all edges from the n i vertices comprising Y go directly into n 1 Y i 1 k n i choices. Thus f Y i 1 k n i ak i . By definition, g is the number of automata in A for which 1 is the only source, that is, g bk n and the Proposition now follows from . An unlabeled SAF automaton is an equivalence class of SAF automata under relabeling of the interior vertices. Liskovets notes and we prove below that Bk n has no nontrivial automorphisms, that is, each of the n 1 ! relabelings of the interior vertices of B Bk n produces a different automaton. So unlabeled SAF automata of size n on a k letter alphabet are counted by 1 n 1 !bk n . The next result establishes a canonical representative in each relabeling class. Proposition 2. Each equivalence class in Bk n under relabeling of interior vertices has size n 1 ! and contains exactly one SAF automaton with the last occurrences increas ing property the last occurrences of the interior vertices 2, 3, . . ., n in the bottom row of its two line representation occur in that order. Proof The first assertion follows from the fact that the interior vertices of an au tomaton

Chunk: Neveu Schwarz states was considered in and will be briefly reviewed here. As all three kinematic factors K12, K13 and K14 are equivalent, it is sufficient to consider K12 in detail. With all external states being identical, the symmetrisations of can be carried out at the end of the calculation K4B 1F2 F 3F4 4B 4 W 3F4 F 1F2 1 12 1 34 1 13 24 W1F2F3F4 4B Expanding the superfields and adopting the notation YABCD abcd D mnpqr sW A a F B b,mnF C c,pqF D d,rs E , the Neveu Schwarz states come from terms of the form YABCD YABCD with A odd and B, C, D even. Using the shuffling identities to simplify, one obtains W1F2F3F4 1 23 1 24 1 3Y5000 Y1400 Y3200 Y1022 , and therefore K4B 12 can be written as the image of a symmetrisation operator S4B K4B 1 12 1 34 1 13 24 1 23 1 24 It is worth noting at this point that, on the sixteen dimensional space of Lorentz scalars built from the four field strengths Fi and two momenta, the symmetriser S4B has rank four. The correlators were computed in , using the method outlined in section 2.1. Two are zero, 0, and the remaining ones are mnpqr s ab bcd nef , mnpq r s ab qcd sef . In reducing those two contributions to a set of independent scalars, one finds that they both are not just sums of k k F 4 terms but also contain terms of the form k F terms. The latter are projected out by the symmetriser S4B, and the result is K4B Y3200 Y1022 1 120 s13 s23 4 Tr F 1F2F3F4 Tr F 1F2 Tr F3F4 , 1 720 s13 s23 t8F 4 . By trivial index exchange, one obtains K13 and K14, and the total is K4B 2 s13 s23 12 34 s12 s23 13 24 s12 s13 14 23 t8F 4 , a product of the completely symmetric one loop kinematic factor t8F 4 and a completely symmetric combination of the momenta and the ij. 13 4.2 Four fermions The calculation involving four Ramond states is very similar to the bosonic one. Focussing on the K12 part, the symmetrisations in can again be rewritten as action of sym metrisation operators on the correlator of superfields with one particular labelling K4F 12 ui 1 12 1 34 1 13 24 W1F2F3F4 u1 u2 u3 1 12 W1F2F3F4 u1 u2 u3 u4 The last step follows from the fact that all scalars of the form k4u4 see appendix A.2 , and therefore all k4 u4 scalars, are invariant under 13 24 and have 34. This time, on expanding the superfields, one collects the terms YABCD with A even and B, C, D odd. After using to simplify, W1F2F3F4 u1 u2 u3 1 23 1 24 1 3Y2111 Y0311 , and after translating to commuting wavefunctions ui, which multiplies every permutation operator with its signature, one obtains K4F 12 ui S4F 1 3Y2111 ui Y0311 ui , 1 12 1 23 1 24 . This symmetriser has rank three, and the result is again not determined by symmetry. Two correlators have to be computed Y2111 ui 2 k1 ak21 2 2 Y0311 ui 2 k1 aq31 2 3 , and one finds that they both are not just sums of k1 k1 F 4 terms but also contain terms of the form k1 F terms. The latter are projected out by the symmetriser S4F, and the result is K4F 2 k1 ak21 k1 aq31 , a product of the completely symmetric one loop kinematic factor t4F and a completely symmetric combination of the momenta and the ij. 13 5. Conclusion The results of the previous sections were briefly reviewed above. It was shown that the Neveu Schwarz states come from terms of the form YABCD with A odd and B, C, D even, and that the correlators of the four fermion process involve the same kinematic factors as the bosonic case, with the same structure. It was furthermore shown that the symmetriser operator S4B has rank four, and the symmetriser S4F has rank three, and the total result is a product of the completely symmetric one-loop kinematic factor t8F 4 and a completely symmetric

Potter2, B. Warner1 and P.A. Woudt1 1Astronomy Department, University of Cape Town, Rondebosch 7700, Cape Town, South Africa 2South African Astronomical Observatory, Observatory 7935, Cape Town, South Africa 3Physics and Astronomy Department, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, S3 7RH, UK 11 February 2013 ABSTRACT Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar IP EX Hya in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin modulated radial velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near 500 600 km s 1. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion cur tain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending from velocities of 500 km s 1 to 1000 km s 1. These findings have confirmed the theoretical model predictions of King Wynn , Belle et al. and Norton et al. for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed, confirming the result of Belle et al. that disc overflow in EX Hya is present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the H and H spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the outer disc edge, while those of H were produced due to the flow of material along the field lines far from the white dwarf narrow component and close to the white dwarf broad base component , in agreement with the accretion curtain model. Key words accretion discs, binary stars cataclysmic variables. 1 INTRODUCTION EX Hya is an Intermediate Polar IP , a sub class of magnetic Cat aclysmic Variable Stars mCVs where a late type main sequence star transfers material to the magnetic white dwarf star as the two stars orbit each other under the influence of their mutual grav itation. Unlike in Polars, another subclass of mCVs, where the white dwarf is in synchronous rotation with the binary rotation , the white dwarf in an IP is in asynchronous rotation with the orbital motion of the system. EX Hya, however, is nearer synchronism than the majority of IPs as it has a spin period 67.03 min which is about 2 3 its orbital period 98.26 min Mumford 1967 Hellier et al. 1987 , and is one of only six out of thirty nine confirmed IPs with its orbital period below the 2 3 h CV period gap Norton et al. 2004 . It has an inclination 1 . Recent studies have shown that EX Hya does not conform to the traditional IP model King Wynn 1999 Wynn 2000 Belle et al. 2002 Norton et al. 2004 Belle et al. 2005 . This sys E mail nceba circinus.ast.uct.ac.za tem has a large Pspin Porb ratio 0.68 implying that it can not be in the usual spin equilibrium rotation since most IPs have been shown to attain spin equilibrium near Pspin Porb 0.1 King Wynn 1999 Wynn 2000 . This further implies that the corotation radius is far greater than the Roche lobe radius in the system. In addition, the accretion curtain in EX Hya extends to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius, which has made the system an ideal test case for the prediction of King Wynn 1999 , Belle et al. 2002 and Norton et al. 2004 that the large accretion curtains in EX Hya should extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius. The large corotation radius, the accretion curtain extending to the Roche lobe radius, and the fact that the system has a spin period close to synchronism with its orbital period all point to a system not in a usual spin equilibrium rotation and thus make EX Hya an ideal test case for the prediction of these authors. 1.2 Objectives The main objectives of the observations presented here were to; 1. determine the nature of the accretion curtain in EX Hya, 2. determine the spin modulation of the accretion curtain, 3. provide empirical evidence for the theoretical model predictions of King Wynn 1999 , Belle et al. 2002 and

Chunk: Formation of quasi solitons in transverse confined ferromagnetic film media A.A. Serga 1 Technische Universit at Kaiserslautern, Department of Physics and Forschungsschwerpunkt MINAS, D 67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany M. Kostylev 2 School of Physics, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley WA 6009, Australia and St.Petersburg Electrotechnical University, 197376, St.Petersburg, Russia B. Hillebrands Technische Universit at Kaiserslautern, Department of Physics and Forschungsschwerpunkt MINAS, D 67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany Abstract The formation of quasi 2D spin wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized stripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time and space resolved Brillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that the confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the lateral stripe edges. Thus, the so called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic mag netization takes place at the edges. In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The experiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the shape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the confinement. We report on the observation of a new type of a stable, two dimensional nonlinear spin wave packet propagating in a magnetic waveguide structure and suggest a theoretical description of our experimental findings. Stable two dimensional spin wave packets, so called spin wave bullets, were previ ously observed, however solely in long and wide samples of a thin ferrimag netic film of yttrium iron garnet YIG , that were practically un 1Email address serha rhrk.uni kl.de 2Email address kostylev cyllene.uwa.edu.au 1 arXiv 0704.0024v1 nlin.PS 31 Mar 2007 bounded in both in plane directions compared to the lateral size of the spin wave packets and the wavelength of the carrier spin wave. In a waveguide structure, where the transverse dimension is comparable to the wavelength, up to day only quasi one dimensional nonlinear spin wave objects were ob served, which are spin wave envelope solitons. Here a typical system is a narrow 1 2mm stripe of a YIG ferrite film . Both for solitons and bul lets the spreading in dispersion is compensated by the longitudinal nonlinear compression. Concerning the transverse dimension, solitons have a cosine like amplitude distribution due to the lateral confinement in the waveguide, whereas bullets show a transverse nonlinear instability compensating pulse widening due to diffraction and leading to transverse confinement. Here we report on the observation of a new stable spin wave packet prop agating along a waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction with the side walls of the waveguide are important. The experiments were carried out using a longitudinally magnetized long YIG film stripe of 2.5mm width and 7 m thickness. The magnetizing field was 1831Oe. The spin waves were excited by a microwave magnetic field created with a microstrip antenna of 25 m width placed across the stripe and driven by electromagnetic pulses of 20ns duration at a carrier frequency of 7.125GHz. As is well known the backward volume magnetostatic spin wave BVMSW excited in the given experimental configuration is able to form both envelope solitons and bullets , depending on the geometry. The spatio temporal behavior of the traveling BVMSW packets was investigated by means of space and time resolved Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy . The obtained results are demonstrated in Fig. 1 where the spatial distri butions of the intensity of the spin wave packets are shown for given moments of time. The spin wave packets propagate here from left to right and decay in the course of their propagation along the waveguide because of magnetic loss. The left set of diagrams corresponds to the linear case. The power of the driving electromagnetic wave is 20mW. The right set of diagrams demonstrates the nonlinear case. The power of the driving electromagnetic wave is 100mW. The difference between the linear and nonlinear cases is that the spin wave bullets are stable only in the case of large driving power. In the nonlinear case, a new stable spin wave packet prop agating along a waveguide structure was observed. These packets are formed by the interaction between the spin wave envelope and the side walls of the waveguide, and are not influenced by the transversal instability. The spatial distributions of such packets are shown in the right set of diagrams of Fig. 1. The stability of these packets allows them to propagate a long distance without any noticeable changes in their shape. The distance at which the packets decay is determined by the magnetic loss of the ferrimagnetic film. The length of the waveguide used in the experiments was 50mm. The spin wave packets traveled this distance without any noticeable changes in their shape. The new spin wave packets were observed in the nonlinear regime at a power of the driving electromagnetic wave of 100 mW. The observed phenomena are very promising for future development of spin wave technology.

The effect is most pronounced when this lattice mode associated with the G band in graphene Raman spectrum is in resonance with inter Landau level transitions 0 , 1 and , 1 0, at a magnetic field B0 30T. It can be used to measure the strength of the electron phonon coupling directly, and its filling factor dependence can be used experimentally to detect circularly polarized lattice vibrations. PACS numbers 78.30.Na, 73.43. f, 81.05.Uw In metals and semiconductors the spectra of phonons are renormalized by their interaction with electrons. Some of the best known examples include the Kohn anomaly in the phonon dispersion, which originates from the excitation de excitation of electrons across the Fermi level upon the propagation of a phonon through the bulk of a metal and a shift in the longitudinal opti cal phonon frequency in heavily doped polar semiconduc tors . However, despite the transparency of theoretical models the observation of such effects is often obscured by the difficulty to change the electron density in a mate rial, whereas in semiconductor structures containing two dimensional 2D electrons the density of which can be varied, the influence of the latter on the phonon modes is weak due to a negligibly small volume fraction occupied by the electron gas. In this context, a unique opportunity arises in graphene based field effect transistors , where the density of carriers in an atomically thin film mono layer or a bilayer can be continuously varied from 1013cm 2 p type to 1013cm 2 n type. Several Ra man experiments have already been reported where the variation of carrier density in graphene changes the optical phonon frequency, in agreement with theoretical expectations . When graphene is exposed to a quantizing magnetic field, its electronic spectrum quenches into discrete Lan dau levels LLs . Then, the optical phonon energy in graphene may coincide with the energy of one of the inter LL transitions, a condition known as magnetophonon resonance . Recently, Ando has suggested that in undoped graphene the magnetophonon resonance enhances the effect of the electron phonon coupling on a spectrum of the in plane optical phonons the E2g modes attributed to the G band in the Raman spectra in Refs. . In this paper, we investigate a rich structure of the anti crossing experienced by such lattice modes when a magnetic field makes their energy equal to the energy of one of the valley antisymmetric interband magnetoexcitons . Most saliently, the dif ference between circular polarization of various inter LL transitions makes the magnetophonon resonance distinguishable for lattice vibrations of different circular polarization, which makes the number of split lines in the fine structure acquired by a phonon and the value of splitting dependent on the electronic filling factor, . The in plane optical phonons in graphene relative dis placement ux, uy of sublattices A and B have the energy 0.2eV at the point in the center of the Brillouin zone . These phonons and their coupling to electrons can be described using the Hamiltonian , ,q b ,qb ,q g 2M xuy yux , u r X ,q 1 2NucM b ,q b , q e ,qe iq r, where b ,q are annihilation creation operators of a phonon with polarisation e ,q, M is the mass of a carbon atom, N is the number of unit cells in the lattice, e ,q is the creation annihilation operator of a charge carrier with momentum q and energy e, iq r, iq r is the electron-phonon coupling vertex. In the presence of a magnetic field B, the phonon energy is shifted due to the Zeeman splitting of the energy levels of the electrons in the magnetic field. A strong coupling between circularly polarized electrons and circularly polarized phonons is allowed by symmetry when the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the plane of the graphene layer. The strength of the electron-phonon coupling constant is related to the energy splitting of the inter Landau level transitions ΔE LL,n,m=| E n - E m | ,1 , where n, m are the indices of the Landau levels. The filling factor dependencies of the magnetophonon resonance for the in plane optical phonons polarized either parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field are displayed in the figure below.

Chunk: . The proton wave function for example, is expressed as P, 1 2 0.90 P 2 8 SS 0.34 P 2 8 S S 0.27 P 2 8 SM where the baryon SU O wave functions are denoted as B2S 1 N L , N is SU mul tiplicity. S, L are the total spin and total orbital angular momentum while S, M, A denotes the permutation symmetry of SU . The spin polarization functions will be re markably affected by configuration mixing. Following refs. 15, 17, we define the number operator by u nu u nd d nd d ns s ns s , where nq , nq are the number of q , q quarks. The spin structure of the mixed proton is given by P P, 1 2 N P, 1 2 0.902 0.342 5 3u 1 3u 1 3d 2 3d 0.272 4 3u 2 3u 2 3d 1 3d . The spin structure after considering emission is obtained by replacing for every quark in eq. by q , 1 Pi q , Pflipping q , Pnon flipping q , , 10 where Pflipping q , and Pnon flipping q , are the probabilities of quark helicity flipping and non flipping for q , respectively. For example, in the case of u quark we have, Pflipping u 2 3 xu u 0 2 xu u 2 u xu d 2d xu sK 2s , and Pnon flipping u 1 3 xu u 0 2 xu u 2 u xu d 2d xu sK 2s . Finally the spin polarization functions defined as q are 0.902 0.342 4 3 114 xu u 0 2 48 xu u 2 36 xu sK 2 27 0.272 2 3 66 xu u 0 2 24 xu u 2 18 xu sK 2 27 , 0.902 0.342 1 3 6 xu u 0 2 12 xu u 2 9 xu sK 2 27 0.272 1 3 42 xu u 0 2 12 xu u 2 9 xu sK 2 27 , xu sK 2 3 . There are several measured quantities which can be expressed in terms of the above spin polarization functions. The quantities usually calculated are u d 2 s, obtained from the neutron decay and the weak decays of hyperons respectively. Another important quantity is the flavor singlet component of the total quark spin content defined as 2 u d s . We also calculate some weak axial vector form factors which are also related to the spin polarization functions, GA GV 2 u d s , GA GV , and GA GV 1 3 u d 2 s . IV. BARYON OCTET MAGNETIC MOMENTS Considering the relative angular momentum between quark and Goldstone boson , the magnetic moment operator of a q system is q eq mq s eq 2pp2q m2q p p2 m2 pp2q m2q p p2 m2 l e 2 p p2 m2 pp2 q m2 q pp2q m2q p p2 m2 l 11 where eq and e are the electric charges carried by q and respectively, s the quark spin operator and l the relative angular momentum bewteen q and . The first term in Eq is the intrinsic magnetic moment of quark and the other two terms are the contribution of the orbital angular momentum. Here we have to consider the relativistic effect since the relative momentum of q or are comparable to their masses in the q system pq, mq, . With the SHO wave functions of , the magnetic moment of q system can be readily calculated. Then we can recalculate the magnetic moments of constituent quarks taking into account of the relativistic effect. For example, the magnetic moments of the u quark is zu 2 Pu u 0 Pu u Pu d Pu sK , , and the contribution from q system is given by 0.22 2 0.08 2 0.45 2 0.15 2 0.05 2 0.28 2 0.11 2 0.48 2 0.20 2 where are the contributions from the configurations 6 3u 1 3u 1 3d 2 3d 1 3u 2 3u 2 3d 1 3d 1 3u 1 3d 2 3d 1 3d 6 3u 1 3u 1 3d 2 3d 1 3u 2 3u 2 3d 1 3d 1 3u 1 3d 2 3d 1 . The calculation of the magnetic moment of quarks in the octet is similar to the above and all the results are given in Table . The magnetic moment of the octet baryons can be expressed in terms of the spin polarization functions and the intrinsic magnetic moment of quarks which is related to the axial

Chunk: density distribution. The sampler was started from the parameter set which triggered the highest value of 2F in our grid based coherent run of the analysis see former section . The automated function of the Metropolis sampling is achieved by controlling the sampling step size with adaptive acceptance probability techniques . The sampler therefore does not depend on assumptions about the signal in the data set in order to perform successfully and reliably it develops a suitable algorithm and approach by itself based on the properties of the likelihood as found on the fly, in the initial steps of the sampler. The length of our Markov chain was pre set to 106, with the initial 104 chain states discarded as the burn in phase of our sampler. The runtime for one data analysis run is 5 hours on a single 2 GHz CPU on the Tsunami cluster of the University of Birmingham. WD MLDC1 6 Figure 2.

The vertical black solid line denotes the true value of the parameter for the polarisation angle the true value modulo 2 , and the grey dashed line the initial value for the MCMC analysis as determined by the template of the first stage that produces the maximum value of the F statistic.

WD MLDC1 7 Figure 3. The marginalised posterior probability density functions of the eight unknown parameters for the the challenge data set 1.1.1b. Labels are as in Figure 2. 3. Results We found that the most promising candidate signal from the F statistic search already matched the true embedded signal to high accuracy, particularly in frequency and sky location. Our MCMC sampler, as a post processing unit, thus only needed 1000 iterations to burn in and to establish a reliable sampling from the posterior. The marginalised posteriors are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. We found, as seen in latter figures, that the MCMC sampler further refined the initial guesses from the F statistic, as measured by the absolute difference between the true value of a given parameter and the median of the marginalised posterior recovered for that parameter.

Chunk: tensor P vanishes. In this case, it follows from the identity that . 18 Proposition 3.32. A P2 like Finsler manifold M, L is a P Finsler manifold. Proof. As M, L is P2 like, then from , we have bP X, Y oT X, Y . Using Lemma 3.1, we get T X, Y 0T X, Y , from which, by taking the trace, 0T, where C,C C2 . Hence the result. The next definition will be useful in the sequel. Definition 3.33. A tensor field is positively homogenous of degree r in the directional argument y symbolically, h r if it satisfies the condition r , or D r . Lemma 3.34.

Then, M, L is necessarily one of the following a A Riemannian manifold of constant curvature, b A Finsler manifold of dimension 2, c A Finsler manifold of dimensions n 3 with vanishing scalar k0 and X o Y Y o X . 19 Proof. For a Ch recurrent manifold, one can easily show that 1 1 T X, Y, Z, W 1 1 T Y, X, Z, W T Z, W X, Y T Z, W .

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0054v1 math.CA 2 Apr 2007 The Hardy Lorentz Spaces Hp,q Rn Wael Abu Shammala and Alberto Torchinsky Abstract In this paper we consider the Hardy Lorentz spaces Hp,q Rn , with , . We discuss the atomic decomposition of the elements in these spaces, their interpolation properties, and the behavior of singular integrals and other operators acting on them. The real variable theory of the Hardy spaces represents a fruitful setting for the study of maximal functions and singular integral operators. In fact, it is because of the failure of these operators to preserve L1 that the Hardy space H1 assumes its prominent role in harmonic analysis. Now, for many of these operators, the role of L1 can just as well be played by H1, , or Weak H1. However, although these operators are amenable to H1 L1 and H1, L1, estimates, interpolation between H1 and H1, has not been available. Similar considerations apply to Hp and Weak Hp for 1. The purpose of this paper is to provide an interpolation result for the Hardy Lorentz spaces Hp,q, , , including the case of Weak Hp as and end point for real interpolation. The atomic decomposition is the key ingredient in dealing with interpolation since in this context neither truncations are available, nor reiteration applies. The paper is organized as follows. The Lorentz spaces, including criteria that assure membership in Lp,q, , , are discussed in Section 1. In Section 2 we show that distributions in Hp,q have an atomic decomposition in terms of Hp atoms with coefficients in an appropriate mixed norm space. An interesting application of this decomposition is to Hp,q Lp, estimates for Calder on Zygmund singular integral operators, . Also, by manipulating the different levels of the atomic decomposition, we show that, for , Hp,q is an intermediate space between Hp,q1 and Hp,q2. This result applies to Calder on Zygmund singular integral operators, including those with variable kernels, Marcinkiewicz integrals, and other operators. 1 1 The Lorentz spaces The Lorentz space Lp,q Rn Lp,q, , , consists of those measurable functions f with finite quasinorm f p,q given by f p, q p Z 0 t1 pf t q dt t 1 q , , f p, sup t1 pf t , . The Lorentz quasinorm may also be given in terms of the distribution func tion m f, , loosely speaking, the inverse of the non increasing rearrangement f of f. Indeed, we have f p, q p Z 0 q 1m f, q p d 1 q X k 2km f, 2k 1 p q 1 q , when , and f p, sup k 2km f, 2k 1 p , . Note that, in particular, Lp, , and Lp, is weak Lp. The following two results are useful in verifying that a function is in Lp,q. Lemma 1.1. Let , and . Assume that the non negative sequence satisfies lq. Further suppose that the non negative function verifies the following property there exists 1 such that, given an arbitrary integer k0, we have k0 k0, where k0 is essentially bounded and satisfies k0 c 2k0, and 2k0 p m k0, 2k0 c X k0 2k k p . Then, Lp,q, and p,q c lq. Proof. It clearly suffices to verify that 1 p , where is an arbitrary positive constant. Now, given k0, let k0 and k0 be as above, and put c 1, where c is the constant in the above inequalities for this choice of , . 2 When , we have 2k0 m k0, 2k0 1 p c X k0 2 k 1 2k k p 1 p c 2 k0 1 sup k k0 2k k . Thus, 2k0 m k0, 2k0 1 p supk k0 2k k , and, consequently, 2k0 m , 2k0 1 p c l , all k0. When , let 1 2 and let be the smallest integer greater than or equal to (1 2)k2 . We have to show that 2k0 m k0, 2k0 1 p, i.e. k0 1 m k0, 2k0 1 p. Since (1 2)k2 k k0, k0 2k0 1 1, so, and consequently, 2k0 1 m k0, 2k0 1 p, as desired. 2.2. When , we have 2k0 m k0, 2k0 1 p sup k k0 2k k , and so, 2k0 m , 2k0 1 p c l , all k0. We conclude that Lp,q, and p,q c lq. The proof of the next result, which complements Lemma 1.1, is similar and is omitted. 1.2. Let , and . Assume that the non negative sequence satisfies lq. Further suppose that the non negative function verifies the following property there exists 1 such that, given an arbitrary integer k0, we have k0 k0,

We demonstrate generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single lined binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique line in the mass radius diagram with M . For HAT TR 205 013, we assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary s rotation has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line broadening, Vrot sin .9 1.0 km s 1, gives a primary radius of .28 0.04 R . Our light curve analysis leads to the radius of the secondary, .167 0.006 R , and the semimajor axis of the orbit, .54 0.30 .0351 0.0014 AU. Our single lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the individual masses, .124 0.010 M and .04 0.13 M . Our result for HAT TR 205 013 B lies above the theoretical mass radius models from 1Department of Astronomy, Harvard University, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138 2Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138 3Department of Astronomy, Pontificia Universidad Cat olica, Casilla 306, Santiago 22, Chile 4Hubble Fellow 5Konkoly Observatory, Budapest, P.O.

INTRODUCTION Solving for the masses and radii of stars has traditionally been accomplished through the analysis of double lined eclipsing binaries, where the light of both components is detected. Masses and radii determined this way are fundamental and can be very accurate, because they rely only on Newton s laws and geometry for the analysis of the spectroscopic orbit and light curve, and not on models of stellar structure and evolution. In particular, analysis of the eclipse light curve yields the orbital inclination, and when combined with the double lined spectroscopic orbit, this yields individual masses for both stars. There are dozens of double lined eclipsing binaries with very accurate mass and ra dius determinations e.g. see Andersen 1991, for a review , but only 10 M dwarfs in 5 systems with accuracies better than 3 percent. In order of increasing mass, the 5 systems are CM Draconis Lacy 1977 Metcalfe et al. 1995, YY Eridani Halbwachs 1997, GJ 229AB Fischer & Marcy 1992, LHS 1505B Delfosse et al. 1997, and LHS 2522B Delfosse et al. 1997. The lack of such binaries is probably due to the difficulty in detecting the low mass secondary in a double lined spectrum. The first two systems have M dwarf secondaries with masses of 0.107 and 0.084 M , respectively, and the latter three systems have M dwarf secondaries with masses of 0.055, 0.065, and 0.058 M . In this paper, we present a unique example of an M dwarf secondary in an eclipsing binary, but in this case it is a single lined system, HAT TR 205 013. The binary consists of a F7V primary and a late M dwarf secondary,.

Chunk: of the double beta decay 2039.006 keV , as containing several weak photopeaks. It was suggested and has been shown that four of these peaks are produced by a contamination from the isotope 214Bi, whose lines are present throughout the Heidelberg Moscow background spectrum. In this work they performed a measurement of a 226Ra source with a high purity germanium detector. The aim of this work was to study the spectral shape of the lines in the energy region from 2000 to 2100keV and, most important, to show the difference in this spectral shape when changing the position of the source with respect to the detector, and to verify the effect of TCS True Coincidence Summing for the weak 214Bi lines seen in the Heidelberg Moscow experiment. The activity of the 226Ra source is 95.2kBq. The isotope 226Ra appears in the 238U natural decay chain and from its decays also 214Bi is produced. The spectrum of 214Bi is clearly visible in the 226Ra measured spectrum. 214Bi is a naturally occurring isotope it is produced in the 238U natural decay chain through the decay of 214Pb and the alpha decay of 218At. With a subsequent reaction, 214Bi decays then into 214Po the branching ratio with respect to the decay into 210Tl is 99.979 . The decay, however, does not lead d state of 214Po, but to its excited states. From the decays of those excited states to the ground tate the well known spectrum of 214Bi is obtained, which contains more than hundred lines. the table given below, one can see in the energy region around the Q value of the 0 decay 2000 2100keV , ur lines and one E0 transition with energy 2016.7keV are expected. The E0 transition can produce a T double beta decay experiment. The experiment took data during 80 of its installation time. The Q value for neutrinoless double beta decay was recently determined with high precision. The background of the experiment primordial activities of the natural decay chains from 238 232 U, Th, and 40K anthropogenic radio nuclides, like 137 134 125 207 Cs, Cs, Sb, Bi cosmogenic isotopes, produced by activation due to cosmic rays during production and transport the bremsstrahlungs spectrum of 210Bi daughter of 210Pb elastic and inelastic neutron scattering and direct muon induced events.

The considerations for the measurement were the efficiency of the detector which depends on the size of the detector and on the distance source detector and the effect called True Coincidence Summing TCS . The lifetimes of the atomic excited levels are much shorter than the resolving time of the detector. If two gamma rays are emitted simultaneously from the same decay it is possible to observe them as a single event. This effect reduces the measured background. The True Coincidence Summing for the weak 214Bi lines was investigated using the 226Ra source. The gamma-ray spectrum of 226Ra was measured using a high purity germanium detector. The aim of this work was to study the spectral shape of the lines in the energy region from 2000 to 2100keV and, most important, to show the difference in this spectral shape when changing the position of the source with respect to the detector, and to verify the effect of TCS True Coincidence Summing for the weak 214Bi lines seen in the Heidelberg Moscow experiment. The activity of the 226Ra source is 95.2kBq. The measurement was performed using an ultra-low background Ge detector. The Heidelberg Moscow double beta decay experiment has a background caused by primordial activities of the natural decay chains from 238U, 232Th, and 40K, anthropogenic radio nuclides like 137

Introduction. 1.1. Description of the model. We give a quantitative analysis of clus tering in a stochastic model of one dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of n point particles, each one of mass 1 n. These particles are ran domly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds. Particles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When two or more particles collide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass and speed are defined by the laws of mass and momentum conservation. Between collisions, particles move according to the laws of Newtonian mechanics. We suppose that the force of mutual attraction does not depend on dis tance and equals the product of masses. This assumption is natural for Received March 2007 revised September 2007. 1Supported in part by the Grants NSh 4222.2006.1 and DFG RFBR 436 RUS 113 773 0 1 R . AMS 2000 subject classifications.

This reprint differs from the original in pagination and typographic detail. 1 2 V. V. VYSOTSKY one dimensional models because, by the Gauss law applied to flux of the gravitational field, gravitation is proportional to the distance to the power one minus dimension of the space. At any moment, the acceleration of a particle is thus equal to difference of masses located to the right and to the left of the particle. Random initial positions of particles are usually described see by the following natural models in the uniform model, n particles are independently and uniformly spread on in the Poisson model, particles are located at points 1 nS1, 1 nS2,..., 1 nSn, where Si is a standard exponential random walk. In other words, particles are located at points of first n jumps of a Poisson process with intensity n. These two models are the most natural and interesting let us call them the main models of initial positions. However, we will see that behavior of the Poisson model is essentially defined by independence of initial dis tances between particles rather than by the particular type of the distances distribution. Therefore, it is of a great mathematical interest to general ize the Poisson model by introducing the i.d. model, where i.d. stands for independent distances, as follows. Particles are initially located at 1 nS1, 1 nS2,..., 1 nSn, where Si is a positive random walk whose nonnegative i.i.d. increments Xi satisfy the normalization condition . Note that if we proceed with the Poisson model and take the number of jumps n tending to infinity, we obtain the i.d. model. The purpose of the paper is to compare the behavior of the stochastic model of one dimensional gas under the main models of initial positions and to investigate the limit behavior of the number of clusters at large times. The results of the paper are new and, in some sense, are complementary to the results of L.P. Kadanoff [10], where the behavior of one dimensional gas with finite number of particles was considered. 1.2. Functional limit theorem. Let n be the number of initial particles. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of Kn t as n , where Kn t denotes the number of clusters at time t in the system with n initial particles. Our main result is a functional limit theorem for Kn t . Its proof is based on the discovered localization property of the aggregation process, which states that the behavior of each particle is essentially defined by the motion of neighbor particles. This property allows us to reduce the aggregation process to a random walk on the space of configurations of particles. We will show that the behavior of the random walk is described by a diffusion process with a unique

On the other hand, the issues that make it not plausible for the sharp kink being of spin origin, es pecially the spin resonance mode, remain i the nearly constant energy scale as a function of doping in small gap system12 ii the multiple modes12 iii the presence of clear kink in the normal state4,13,16 iv the detailed agreement between B1g phonon based explanation of the mode coupling as a function of momentum11,14, while the spin resonance with tiny spectral weight 2 is un likely to give an explanation for both nodal and antin odal renormalization v the accumulated evidence for lattice polaron effect in underdoped and deeply under doped systems35,36. With these weaknesses of the spin resonance interpretation, lattice effect is a more plausible explanation of the renormalization effects. It remains a possibility that the spin fluctuation and other strong cor relation effects are also very important to determine the 6 electronic structure of cuprates they likely contribute to a smooth renormalization of the band and may be more relevant to the higher binding energy. However, opti cal phonons are the most probable origin for the renor malization effects due to sharp modes near 40 70 meV, which is also supported by the recent finding of STM experiments37,38.

APPENDIX A MIGDAL ELIASHBERG BASED APPROACH In the calculations presented herein, we evaluate elec tronic self energies and spectral functions via Migdal Eliashberg treatment, as discussed in Ref. 39.

Chunk: lim N 1 N N X x qi, , which we consider as the hypothetical PDF of variable X. Since it can not be determined by repetition of experi ments, we must decide when to stop the experimentation. From the analysis of the properties of Parzen s estima tor 1 Eq. 4.19 we obtain the estimate for the vari ance Var fN x sup g x 2 N, which is applicable if the accuracy of estimation is prescribed. When the accu racy is not prescribed, the inequality only indicates that N should be increased in order to decrease the variance but with increasing N the redundancy increases and we should consider both properties when deciding about a proper number of samples N. With this aim we utilize Igor Grabec EXPERIMENTAL MODELING OF PHYSICAL LAWS 7 two estimators comprising N and T samples. The estima tor with T samples is introduced as a reference by which we estimate the prediction error of the estimator with N samples. Consequently, fT should estimate f with much greater accuracy than fN and therefore we take T N. We then describe the estimation error by the Kullback Leibner information divergence x fT x i log fN x fT x dx and define the information cost of fN relative to fT by . The dependence of C on N with . 2 for the same data as in the case of Fig. 1. The num ber No at which the cost C is minimal is to be considered as the proper number of samples for modeling of PDF. It depends on the samples used in estimator fN and we statistically determined 20 for 0.25, and 64 for 0.05. The relatively large statis tical scattering of No is a consequence of the very slow, approximately logarithmic divergence of the redundancy. The number No also depends on the sample set used in estimator fT , but if T is much greater than No, its influ ence is negligible in comparison with statistical scattering. Fig. 3 shows an example of the estimated probability den sity fNo for 0.25, No 4.8 nat. For the purpose of comparison, fT is also shown in Fig. 3. Our examples show that the proper number No is several times greater than K . Since K can be simply calculated, No can be roughly estimated also without calculation of the cost function. Figure 3 shows that fNo is a rather coarse estimator of probability density. The reason for this property can be explained if the variation of the estimation error and redundancy term in the cost function with increasing N is considered. When N increases the minimum of C is achieved at a low number of samples because of increas ing redundancy hence the estimation error need not be negligible but just properly counter balanced by the re dundancy. This further means that a low number of func tions g x qi, with a small cannot very accurately represent a broad and smooth function fT x . 4 Generalized PDF model If we want to improve the representation of the PDF by a small number of functions we evidently may not keep fixed. For this purpose we change the estimator of fN0 into a general mixture model fM x M X i x by using M basis functions i x g x qi, i and ad justable parameters qi, i and pi. We define here the en tropy of basis functions and the information content of the model as means over probabilities pi 1 pi i x log i x dx log 2L, Z L L M X i x log hPM j x i x i dx.

Chunk: model relative to experimentally estimated fT x as . If we want to adapt the model Eq. 19 to experimental data we must specify the number M and parameters qi, i, pi of basis functions. We cannot achieve this by the variation method since M is an integer number. . Vari ous methods of growing and pruning have been developed for this purpose in the field of neural networks. The growing methods are mainly utilized when the model is adapted to an increasing number of experimental samples, while pruning is used when a large number of experimental samples is compressed to a smaller number of representa tive data. In any case a decision about the creation or annihilation of model terms must be reached, based upon some criterion. In the literature various criteria have al ready been proposed, ranging from purely heueristical to strictly theoretical ones, but at present there is still no generally accepted method. In our treatment we decide to change the number of basis functions in the model if the cost function CM is decreased by such action. With this criterion we tested first the annihilation process and then a combined creation annihilation process, which are described in the following subsections. 4.1 Model optimization by annihilation of terms Consider the case when the function fT is determined by an extensive set of redundant experimental data. We start the adaptation of the model Eq. 19 to these data by selecting xi, , . Af ter that we consider a model with . If we try to determine the parameters of the compressed model by a strict mathematical procedure based on min imization of the cost function CT 1, we obtain a set of non linear equations that is difficult for further treatment. Less rigorously, but physically more sensibly, we proceed by assuming that an improved model can be obtained by compressing i th and k th term determined by pi, qi, i and pk, qk, k into single j th term with parameters , piqi pkqk pj, and 2 j pi pj 2 k pk pj qi qk 2 pipk pj 1 2, that represent the com mon probability, center of gravity and standard deviation, respectively consequently, the total probability and the first two moments of the probability distribution are pre served. The terms are actually compressed only if the cost function is decreased. In the case of just two terms with equal probabilities and widths it was found numerically that they are compressed only if their centers are sepa rated by less than approximately 3 . The procedure is then iterated on all terms of the model until all possi ble compressions are carried out. Fig. 4 shows a result of this procedure for a bi modal PDF. From the function fT, determined by 104 experimental data, we obtain, after compression, the model with just two basis functions and significantly reduced redundancy. The agreement between the experimentally estimated fT and the model function fM is determined by the prediction error .01 nat, while .15 nat describes the information cost of Igor Grabec EXPERIMENTAL MODELING OF PHYSICAL LAWS 9 such a representation. In this case the cost is mainly de termined by the redundancy .14 nat, which is a consequence of the overlapping of model basis functions. 4.2 Model adaptation by the creation annihilation process Although model optimization by annihilation is simple, its weak point is that all the experimental data must be acquired before the start of adaptation. But it is often con venient to form the model simultaneously with acquisition of experimental data. In this case the compression method could still be performed after each acquisition step, but for this purpose all previously acquired data must be stored. We therfore propose a more economical method whereby less numerous model parameters are stored. At x g x x1, . Af ter each acquisition step we then create

Chunk: 0.05 eV A . Bare SiNW N s which are oriented along direc tion and have N Si atoms in their primitive unit cell are initially cut from the ideal bulk Si crystal in rod like forms and subsequently their atomic structures and lat tice parameter are relaxed . The optimized atomic structures are shown for , 25, and 57 in Fig. 2. While bare SiNW is a semiconductor, bare SiNW and SiNW are metallic. The average cohesive energy relative to a free Si atom Ec is comparable with the calculated cohesive energy of bulk crystal 4.64 eV per Si atom and it increases with increasing N. The average co hesive energy relative to the bulk Si crystal, E c, is small but negative as expected. Upon passivation of dangling bonds with hydrogen atoms all of these SiNWs specified as H SiNW become semiconductor with a band gap EG. The binding energy of adsorbed hydrogen relative to the free H atom Eb , as well as relative to the free H2 E b are both positive and increases with increasing N. Exten 2 FIG. 1 Color online Upper curve in each panel with numerals indicate the distribution of first, second, third, fourth etc nearest neighbor distances of SiNW N as cut from the ideal Si crystal, same for structure optimized bare SiNW N middle curve and structure optimized H SiNW N bottom curve for , 57 and 81. Vertical dashed line cor responds to the distance of Si H bond. sive ab initio molecular dynamics calculations have been carried out at 500 K using supercells, which comprise ei ther two or four primitive unit cells of nanowires to lift artificial limitations imposed by periodic boundary con dition. After several iterations lasting 1 ps, the structure of all SiNW N and H SiNW N remained stable. Even though SiNWs are cut from ideal crystal, their optimized structures deviate substantially from crystalline coordi nation, especially for small diameters as seen in Fig.1. Upon hydrogen termination the structure is healed sub stantially, and approaches the ideal case with increas ing N or increasing diameter , as expected. The cal culated response of the wire to a uniaxial tensile force, ET c, ranging from 172 to 394 eV cell indicates that the strength of H SiNW N s is rather high. The adsorption of a single TM , Ti, Co, Cr, and Mn atom per primitive cell, denoted by , have been examined for different sites hollow, top, bridge etc on the surface of H SiNW N for , 25 and 57. In Fig. 2 c we present only the most energetic adsorption geometry for a specific TM atom for each N, which re sults in a HM state. These are Co doped H SiNW , Cr doped SiNW and Cr doped SiNW .

Chunk: relative to the bulk Si, binding energy of hydrogen atom relative to free H atom, same relative to H2 molecule, energy band gap and the net magnetic moment per primitive unit cell. Binding energies in regard to the adsorption of TM atoms, i.e. EB, E B for , E B for . The direction is along the axis of SiNWs. Small, large light and large dark balls represent H, Si and TM atoms, respectively. Side views of atomic structure comprise two primitive unit cells of the SiNWs. Binding and cohesive energies are given in eV atom. 3 SiNW is 0.5 electrons. The charge transfer from Cr to H SiNW and H SiNW is even higher 0.8 and 0.9 electrons, respectively . Binding energies of ad sorbed TM atoms relative to their bulk crystals E B are negative and hence indicate endothermic reaction. Due to very low vapor pressure of many metals, it is proba bly better to use some metal precursor to synthesize the structures predicted here. The band structures of HM nanowires are presented in Fig.3. Once a Co atom is adsorbed above the center of a hexagon of Si atoms on the surface of H SiNW the spin degeneracy is split and whole system becomes magnetic with a magnetic moment of 1 B Bohr mag neton per primitive unit cell . Electronic energy bands become asymmetric for different spins Bands of major ity spins continue to be semiconducting with relatively smaller direct gap of .4 eV. In contrast, two bands of minority spins, which cross the Fermi level, become metallic. These metallic bands are composed of Co 3d and Si 3p hybridized states with higher Co contribution. The density of majority and minority spin states, namely D E, and D E, , display a 100 spin polarization D EF , D EF , D EF , D EF , at EF . Cr doped H SiNW is also HM. Indirect gap of major ity spin bands has reduced to 0.5 eV. On the other hand, two bands constructed from Cr 3d and Si 3p hybridized states cross the Fermi level and hence attribute metal licity to the minority spin bands. Similarly, Cr doped H SiNW is also HM. The large direct band gap of undoped H SiNW is modified to be indirect and is reduced to 0.9 eV for majority spin bands. The mini mum of the unoccupied conduction band occurs above but close to the Fermi level. Two bands formed by Cr 3d and Si 3p hybridized states cross the Fermi level. The net magnetic moment is 4 B. Using PAW potential results, we estimated Curie temperature of half metallic H SiNW TMs as 8, 287, and 709 K for , 25, and 57, respectively. The well known fact that density functional theory un derestimates the band gap, EG does not concern the present HM states, since H SiNWs are already verified to be semiconductor experimentally and upon TM doping they are predicted to remain semiconductor for one spin direction. In fact, band gaps predicted here are in fair agreement with experiment and theory. As for par tially filled metallic bands of the opposite spin, they are properly represented. Under uniaxial compressive strain the minimum of the conduction band of majority spin states rises above the Fermi level. Conversely, it becomes semi metallic under uniaxial tensile strain. Since conduc tion and valence bands of both H SiNW Co and H SiNW Cr are away from EF , their HM behavior is robust under uniaxial strain. Also the effect of spin orbit coupling is very small and cannot destroy HM properties . The form of two metallic bands crossing the Fermi level eliminates the possibility of Peierls distortion.

Chunk: continuity of g 7 Vg is also easy to see. Indeed, it is enough to prove that g 7 VgX is continuous for any X of the form , v , E, v h. But Vg , v , v , and we have, ugv v v v . By assumption limg e g 0 in the norm topology of E, so 0 as g e. Furthermore, g 7 ugv is continuous. This completes the proof of strong continuity of Vg. In view of the above result, we assume without loss of genetrality that E B h, K with the natural Hilbert module structure inherited from that of B h, K , and g Vg u 1 g . Consider the strong operator closure of E of E in B h, K . It is a Hilbert von Neumann A module where A is the weak closure of A in h . Moreover, the G action u 1 g can be extended to the whole of B h, K , and denoted again by g. Clearly, this action leaves E invariant, hence E, is a Hilbert von Neumann G A module. Let us recall that by E we denote the locally convex space of elements in E such that g 7 g is C in the strong operator topology of E. Theorem 3.2 There exist a Hilbert space k0, a unitary representation wg of G in k0 and an isometry from K to h k0 such that i is equivariant in the sense that ug wg for all g ii A k0 for all E. Proof The statement i is contained in the Theorem 4.3.5 of page 99 . For 7 proving ii , we note that E w.r.t. the action is mapped by into A k0 w.r.t. the action g adug wg , and moreover, for E, g 7 g g is norm continuous since g 7 g is so and is isometry. Thus, ii follows from Lemma 2.3. It follows from the above theorem that E can be equivariantly embedded in the trivial G A module A k0, w . In particular, we have that Theorem 3.3 If a compact Lie group G has an ergodic action on a C algebra A, then every G A module E, is embeddable. Acknowledgement The author would like to thank the anonymous ref eree who pointed out a crucial mistake in the earlier version, which has led to substantial revision of the paper.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0111v1 math.QA 2 Apr 2007 Invariance and the twisted Chern character a case study Debashish Goswami Stat Math Unit, Indian Statistical Institute 203, B. T. Road, Kolkata 700108, India. E mail goswamid isical.ac.in Abstract We give details of the proof of the remark made in that the Chern characters of the canonical generators on the K homology of the quantum group SUq are not invariant under the natural SUq coaction. Furthermore, the conjecture made in about the nontriv iality of the twisted Chern character coming from an odd equivariant spectral triple on SUq is settled in the affirmative. 1 Introduction Noncommutative geometry NCG a la Connes, see and the C algebraic theory of quantum groups see, for example, , are two well developed mathematical areas which share the basic idea of noncom mutative mathematics , namely, to view a general noncommutative C algebra as noncommutative analogue of a topological space, equipped with additional structures resembling and generalizing those in the classical com mutative situation, e.g. manifold or Lie group structure. A lot of fruitful interaction between these two areas is thus quite expected. However, such an interaction was not very common until recently, when a systematic effort by a number of mathematicians for understanding C algebraic quantum groups as noncommutative manifolds in the sense of Connes triggered a rapid and interesting development to this direction. However, quite sur prisingly, such an effort was met with a number of obstacles even in the case of the simplest non classical quantum group, namely SUq and it was not so clear for some time whether this and other standard examples of quantum groups could be nicely fitted into the framework of Connes NCG see and the discussion and

Chunk: that the transition is in fact of weakly first order. It is the objective of the present work to study the Sand vik model6, by approaching the quantum transition from the dimer VBS phase. Our approach uses as a starting point a symmetry broken state i.e. one out of four degenerate VBS configurations , and we thus must search for signatures that the system attempts to restore the lattice symmetry at the QCP. Even though full restoration is impossible within the present framework, we find a QCP characterized by condensation of triplet modes of high density this is in contrast to the conven tional situation when the condensing particles are in the dilute Bose gas limit. The high density itself is due to the presence of a singlet mode that condenses at the QCP, and reflects the strong fluctuations of the background dimer order. The above effects lead to the vanishing of the VBS order parameter at the same time our method, which accounts for the strong fluc tuations, leads to a rather sharp phase transition. It appears that we cannot draw a definite conclusion about the order of the transition because in the vicinity of the QCP the triplon density increases uncontrollably, suggesting that other states such a plaquette states and larger clusters are strongly ad mixed into the ground state. This is generally expected in a situation where the lattice symmetry is restored at the quan tum critical point. The model under consideration is .Sb K X a,b,c,d Sa Sb Sc Sd , where , , and all spins are . Consider the numbers 1,2,3,4 in Fig. 1.

The range of pa rameters explored in Ref. is K J 2, and the QCP is at K J c 1.85. Our coupling notation is slightly different from the one used in Refs. the coupling K is related to the parameter Q6,7 via 1 Q 2J , and the criti cal point in that notation is Q J c 25. The dimerization pattern is proposed to be of the columnar type, as shown in Fig. 1. Four such configurations exist. We will assume a con figuration of this type, will show that it is stable at K J 1, and will then search for an instability towards the N eel state as K J decreases. The rest of the paper is organized as followed. In Sec tion II we present results based on the mean field approach in terms of the dimer triplon operators. In Section III we extend our treatment beyond mean field, and even further in Section IV, where we also take into account low energy singlet two triplon excitations. Section V contains our conclusions. II. MEAN FIELD TREATMENT We start by rewriting Eq. in the the bond operator representation13, where on a dimer i, the two spins forming it are expressed as S 1, s i ti t i si io t i ti , and s i , t i , x, y, z create a singlet and triplet of states. We re fer to the triplet quasiparticle, t i , as triplon . The bold indexes i, j, m, l label the dimers see Fig. 1 . Summa tion over repeated Greek indexes is assumed, unless indicated otherwise. The hard core constraint, s i si t i ti 1, must be en forced on every site, which at the mean field MF level can be done by introducing a term in the Hamiltonian, P i s2

Chunk: M, gab be a n dimensional manifold associated with the metric gab. Given gab, we can have a unique covariant derivative a satisfying , a b b ac c and a b b a d. We parameterize the closed string by two world sheet coordinates and , and then we have the correspond ing vector fields a and a. The Nambu Goto string action is then given by d f , 2 where the coordinates and have ranges 0 T and 0 2 respectively and f , 2 1 2. We now perform an infinitesimal variation of the tubes , traced by the closed string during its evolution in order to find the geodesic surface equation from the least action principle. Here we impose the restriction that the length of the string circumference is independent. Let the vector field a be the deviation vector which represents the displacement to an infinitesimally nearby tube, and let denote the three dimensional sub manifold spanned by the tubes , . We then may choose , and as coordinates of to yield the com mutator relations, b b a b b , b b a b b , b b a b b . Now we find the first variation as follows dS d Z Z d d b a aP b a aP b Z d P b b T 0 Z d P b b 2 0 , where the world sheet currents associated with and directions are respectively given by P a 1 f a a , P a 1 f a a . Using the endpoint conditions a T 0 and pe riodic condition a 2 a , we have the geodesic surface equation a aP b a aP b 0, and the constraint identities P 0, P P 0, P 0, P P 0. Let , denote a smooth one parameter family of geodesic surfaces for each R, the tube is a geodesic surface parameterized by affine parameters and . For an infinitesimally nearby geodesic surface in the family, we then have the following geodesic surface deviation equation b b c cP a b b c cP a R a bcd bP d bP d c . For a small variation a, our goal is to compare S with S of the string. The second variation d2S d 2 is then needed only when dS d 0. Explicitly, the second variation is given by d2S d 2 d c cP b a a b c cP b a a b R d acb aP b aP b c d Z d P b a a b T 0 Z d P b a a b 2 0 . Here the boundary terms vanish for the fixed endpoint and the periodic conditions, even though on the geodesic surface we have breaks which we will explain later. After some algebra using the geodesic surface deviation equa tion, we have d2S d 2 d a a. III. JACOBI FIELDS IN ORTHONORMAL GAUGE The string action and the corresponding equations of motion are invariant under reparameterization , and , . We have then gauge degrees of freedom so that we can choose the orthonormal gauge as follows 0, 0, where the plus sign in the second equation is due to the fact that is timelike and is spacelike. Note that the gauge fixing for the world sheet coordinates means that the tangent vectors are orthonormal everywhere up to a local scale factor . In this parameterization the world sheet currents satisfying the constraints are of the form P a a, P a a. The geodesic surface equation and the geodesic surface deviation equation read a a b a a , and b b c c a b b c c a R a bcd b d b d . We now restrict ourselves to strings on constant scalar curvature manifold such as Sn.

Chunk: in any cases. We have also noticed a recent publication to treat a strongly coupled two level system to a quntum oscillator under an adiabatic approximation, in which something is similar to our work in the solution of the Hamiltonian in the absence of the RWA. But due to the different features in their system from our atomic case, the two level splitting term, much smaller compared to other terms, can be taken as a perturbation. So the advantage of that treatment is the possibility to analytically obtain good approximate solutions. In contrast, not any approximation is used in our solution, which should be more efficient to do the relevant job. In summary, we have investigated the eigensolution of the system with a single trapped ion, experiencing two traveling waves of lasers, in the SER and in the absence of the Lamb Dicke limit. We have found the ground state in the non RWA case to be energically lower than the counterpart of the solution with RWA, which would be useful for quantum information storage and for quantum computing. The analytical forms of the eigenfunction and the 5 complete set of the eigensolutions would be helpful for us to understand a trapped ion in the SER and with a large Lamb Dicke parameter. We argue that our work would be applied to different systems in dealing with strong coupling problems. V.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0119v1 cond mat.str el 2 Apr 2007 Quasi quartet crystal electric field ground state in a tetragonal CeAg2Ge2 single crystal A. Thamizhavel , R. Kulkarni, S. K. Dhar Department of condensed matter physics and materials science, Tata institute of fundamental research, Colaba, Mumbai 400 005, India Abstract We have successfully grown the single crystals of CeAg2Ge2, for the first time, by flux method and studied the anisotropic physical properties by measuring the electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. We found that CeAg2Ge2 undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at .6 K. The electrical resistivity and susceptibility data reveal strong anisotropic magnetic properties. The magnetization measured at 31 kOe and .7 kOe, for H with a saturation magnetization of 1.6 B Ce. The crystalline electric field CEF analysis of the inverse susceptibility data reveals that the ground state and the first excited states of CeAg2Ge2 are closely spaced indicating a quasi quartet ground state. The specific heat data lend further support to the presence of closely spaced energy levels. Key words CeAg2Ge2 CEF quartet ground state antiferromagnetism PACS 81.10. h, 71.27. a, 71.70.Ch, 75.10.Dg, 75.50.Ee Compounds crystallizing in the ThCr2Si2 type struc ture are the most extensively studied among the strongly correlated electron systems. A wide range of compounds crystallize in this type of tetragonal crystal structure and exhibit novel physical properties. Some of the promi nent examples include the first heavy fermion supercon ductor CeCu2Si2, pressure induced superconductors like CePd2Si2, CeRh2Si2, CeCu2Ge2, unconventional metam agnetic transition in CeRu2Si2 etc. CeAg2Ge2 also crys tallizes in the tetragonal ThCr2Si2 type crystal structure. Previous reports of CeAg2Ge2 were on polycrystalline samples and there were conflicting reports on the antifer romagnetic ordering temperature . Furthermore, the ground state properties of CeAg2Ge2 are also quite intrigu ing. Neutron scattering experiments on a polycrystalline sample could detect only one excited state at 11 meV indi cating that the ground state and the first excited states are closely spaced. In order to study the anisotropic physical properties and to study the crystalline electric field ground state, we have grown the single crystals of CeAg2Ge2. Single crystals of CeAg2Ge2 were grown by self flux method, using Ag Ge 75.5 24.5 binary alloy, which forms an eutectic at 650 C, as flux. The details about the crystal Corresponding author. Tel 22 2280 4556 Email address thamizh tifr.res.in A. Thamizhavel . growth process are given elsewhere . Figure 1 a shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity of CeAg2Ge2 for the current direction parallel to both and directions. There is a large anisotropy in the electrical resistivity. The electrical resistivity shows a shal low minimum at 20 K, marginally increases with decrease in temperature down to 4.6 K. With further decrease in the temperature the electrical resistivity drops due to the reduction in the spin disorder scattering caused by the an tiferromagnetic ordering of the magnetic moments, as seen in the inset of Fig. 1 a . The antiferromagnetic transition can be clearly seen at 4.6 K as indicated by the arrow in the figure. Figure 1 b shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility along the two principle directions. As can be seen from the figure there is a large anisotropy in the susceptibility due to tetragonal crystal structure. The high temperature susceptibility does not obey the simple Curie Weiss law on the other hand it can be very well fit ted to a modified Curie Weiss law which is given by 0 C T p , where 0 is the temperature independent part of the magnetic susceptibility and T p is the Curie Weiss temperature. The inverse susceptibility data were analyzed in terms of the crystalline electric field splitting of the Ce 4 f levels and fits were made with the Stevens operators of rank up to 6. The inverse susceptibility data reveal that the ground state and the first excited states of CeAg2Ge2 are closely spaced indicating a quasi quartet ground state. The specific heat data lend further support to the presence of closely spaced energy levels. The specific heat measurements were performed using the relaxation method. The specific heat data are consistent with the magnetic properties as the specific heat data show a broad maximum at about 1 K. The specific heat data give an entropy of 7.8 R ln 2 per Ce ion at low temperatures which is consistent with the presence of a quasi quartet ground state and the first excited state. The magnetic properties of CeAg2Ge2 are consistent with an anisotropic Kramers doublet ground state and the first excited state is split by the crystalline electric field. The ground state properties of CeAg2Ge2 are of particular interest as they exhibit the characteristics of a heavy fermion system. The quasi quartet ground state of CeAg2Ge2 is

The level splitting energies are esti mated to be 130 K. It may be noted that the first excited state is very close to the ground state indicating that the ground state is a quasi quartet state. Figure 1 c shows the field dependence of magnetization at 2 K. For H , the magnetization increases linearly with the field and exhibit two metamagnetic transition at 44.7 kOe before it saturates at 1.6 B Ce at 70 kOe, indicating the easy axis of magneti zation.

The entropy reaches R ln 4 not too far away from the magnetic ordering temperature leading to the conclusion that the ground state and the first excited states are closely spaced or nearly degenerate, thus corrob orating our CEF analysis of the inverse susceptibility data. Figure 2 b shows the field dependence of the specific heat for the field applied parallel to the easy axis of magnetiza tion namely . With the increase in the magnetic field the N eel temperature decreases and the antiferromagnetic ordering apparently vanishes at a critical field of 50 kOe indicating a possibility of a field induced quantum critical point in this compound. However, further low temperature measurements are necessary to confirm this. In summary, we have successfully grown the single crys tals of CeAg2Ge2 by the flux method. CeAg2Ge2 orders an tiferromagnetically at .6 K. The CEF analysis of the inverse susceptibility data indicate the ground state and the first excited states are closely spaced. The heat capacity data support this quasi quartet ground state. Furthermore, the heat capacity in applied magnetic fields revealed that the N eel temperature vanishes at a critical field of 50 kOe indicating a possible field induced quantum critical point in this compound.

Chunk: the Figure 5, since the D6 branes are par allel to the NS5 brane, the newly created Nf D4 branes can slide along the plane consisting of D6 branes and NS5 brane arbitrarily and its mirrors . Then strings connecting the Nf D6 branes and N c D4 branes will give rise to these additional 2Nf SO N c vectors. 15 N2 f fields M are in the representation 1, 1 under the gauge group This corresponds to the SU Nc chiral meson Q eQ and the fluctuations of the singlet M correspond to the motion of Nf flavor D4 branes along directions in Figure 5. The N 2 c singlet is in the representation 1, adj 1, symm under the gauge group This corresponds to the SU Nc chiral meson X e X and note that both X and e X have representation N c of SO N c . In general, the fluctuations of the singlet correspond to the motion of N c D4 branes suspended two NS5 branes along the directions in Figure 5. In the dual theory, since there exist Nf quarks q, Nf quarks eq, one bifundamental field Y which will give rise to the contribution of N c and its complex conjugate eY which will give rise to the contribution of N c, the coefficient of the beta function of the first gauge group factor with is bmag SU e Nc 3 e Nc Nf N c 3Nc and since there exist 2N f quarks Q , one bifundamental field Y which will give rise to the contribution of e Nc, its complex conjugate eY which will give rise to the contribution of e Nc, Nf fields F , its complex conjugate Nf fields f F and the singlet which will give rise to N c, the coefficient of the beta function is bmag SO N c 3 N c 2 2N f 2 eNc 2Nf 2N c 2Nc 4Nf 2N f 6. Therefore, both SU e Nc and SO N c gauge couplings are IR free by requiring the negativeness of the coefficients of beta function. One can rely on the perturbative calculations at low energy for this magnetic IR free region bmag SU e Nc 0 and bmag SO N c 0. Note that the SO N c fields in the magnetic theory are different from those of the electric theory. Since bSO N c bmag SO N c 0, SO N c is more asymptotically free than SO N c mag. Neglecting the SO N c dynamics, the magnetic SU e Nc is IR free when Nf N , as in previous case. The dual magnetic superpotential, by adding the mass term for Q and eQ in the electric theory which is equal to put a linear term in M in the dual magnetic theory, is given by 7 2 Q Q Mqeq Y f F eq eY qF Y eY i mM where the mesons in terms of the fields defined in the electric theory are M Q eQ, X eX, F e XQ, f F X eQ. 7There appears a mismatch between the number of colors from field theory analysis and those from brane motion when we take the full dual process on the two gauge group factors simultaneously . By adding 4N f D4 branes to the dual brane configuration without affecting the linking number counting, this mismatch can be removed. Similar phenomena occurred in . Then this turned out that there exists a deformation W generated by the meson Q X e XQ . This is exactly the second term, Q Q , in . In previous example, there is no such deformation term in . 16 We abbreviated all the relevant terms and coefficients appearing in the quartic superpotential for the bifundamentals in electric theory and denote them here by 2 .

Chunk: spin direction circulates around the origin and is con fined into the x y plane without the third component, that is, a coplanar texture. It is seen that the particle density distribution is strongly coupled to the spin one FIG. 1 Stereographic view of the spin current texture, dis playing simultaneously the number and spin densities. The pancake 0.2 is distorted and at the center the number density is depleted to give a doughnut like shape. .2g.

Left right column shows the cross sectional density plots of the particle number the corre sponding spin structure . The circular profile in the x y plane is spontaneously broken. .2g, 0.2. repulsive interaction . This spin current texture can be readily explained in the following way Locally, along the stream line of the spin current the head to tail configuration minimizes the energy. Globally, the spins at A and B which are situated far apart about the origin O shown in inset of Fig. 1 are orientated anti parallel to minimize the d d in teraction. When the two antiparallel spins at A and B come closer towards the origin O, the kinetic energy due to the spin modulation increases. To avoid this en ergy loss, the particle number is depleted in the central region at the cost of the harmonic potential energy. For an alternative explanation of the spin current texture we rewrite the d d interaction as vdd rij gd r3 ij P2 2 Y2 cos ij with ij being a rank 2 tensor consisting of the two spins at i and j sites, and Y2 cos a spherical harmonics . is the polar angle in spherical coordinates of the system. The spin current texture shown in inset of Fig. 1 picks up the phase factor e2i when winding around the origin. This is coupled to Y2 2 cos sin2 , meaning that this orbital moment dictates the number density depletion at the pancake cen ter. The spin orbit coupling directly manifests itself here. The total angular momentum consisting of the spin and orbit ones is a conserved quantity of the present axis symmetric system, leading to the Einstein de Haas effect .

Chunk: value .27g for 104 particles, the r flare texture becomes unstable, indicating a quantum phase transition. Upon increasing the total particle number the r flare is replaced by the spin current texture. We also note that the z flare texture in which the polarization points to the z axis is equally stable as we explain shortly. Let us turn to the cigar shape case elongated along the z axis with the trap anisotropy 5.0. The stable configuration we obtain is shown in Fig. 4 where the spin structure is basically a flare spin texture which is a non coplanar spin arrangement. Namely, the bending occurs radially so that the spin texture is a three dimensional object, but keeps axis symmetry around the z axis. The particle density is modified from the TF profile for , elongated along the z direction and compressed to the z axis. This can be understood by seeing Fig. 4 b . The up spin density near the center exerts the d d force so as to align the outer spins parallel to the vector connecting the center and its position, taking the head to tail configu ration. This results in a non coplanar structure, but the axis symmetry about the z axis is preserved. This spin texture is stable for gd 0.3g and robust for different aspect ratios 0.2 and 1.5. The bending angle of 4 FIG. 4 a The z flare spin texture in the cigar trap along the z axis. The spins almost point to the z direction. In the outer regions they bent. The bright region in background corresponds to high number density. .2g, 5.0. b Schematic figure to explain this spin configuration due to d d interaction. FIG. 5 a The two z flare spin texture under the same parameter set .2g, 5.0. as in Fig. 4 with different initial spin configuration. The bright region in background corresponds to high number density. b Schematic figure to explain this spin structure. At the . the flare spin texture increases and the elongation along the z direction becomes larger as gd increases 0.1 and 0.2 . Finally we display an example to show how the model Hamiltonian admits many subtle spin textures with com parable energies. Figure 5 a shows the two z flares op positely polarized stacked back to back. This configura tion is stabilized starting with a hedgehog spin config uration, or skyrmion at the center from which all the spins point outward from the origin. In the end the two z flares oppositely polarized become stable, but at the central . 5 b . To avoid drastic changes of the spin direction, or the spin kinetic energy loss, the parti cle density decreases there. As a result even though the harmonic potential energy is minimal there, the two z flare spin textures oppositely polarized are stacked back to back, but two objects are almost split. This example illustrates strong coupling between the particle number and spin densities through the d d interaction. These spin textures can be observed directly via a novel phase sensitive in situ detection or indirectly via con ventional absorption imaging for the number density. It is interesting to examine the vortex properties under ro tation. For the spin current texture, the vortex entry into a system should be easy because in the central region the mass density is already depleted. We point out that the collective modes might be also intriguing because the mass density is tightly coupled with the spin degrees of freedom. These problems belong to future work. In summary, we have introduced a model Hamiltonian to capture the essential nature of dipolar spinor BEC where the spin magnitude is large enough, focusing on long wavelength and low energy textured solutions. We show several typical stable configurations by solving the Gross Pitaevshii equation where the spin and mass den sities are strongly coupled due

Chunk: like shown in Fig.3 oscillogrammes b d are observed for chaotic SE pulse modes even more often that purely helical chaotic movements with the unit half period shown in Fig.3a. It is essential that the observed transitions between SE chaotic modes with different maximum half periods be of non hysteretic character, as distinct from the above described hysteretic transitions between independent regular branches with different periods of movement like those shown in Fig.2 . To clear up specific mechanisms of branching of SE modes and appearance of variable refractority in chaotic realizations of pulse phonon generation, we should address the deterministic SE model in a high Q factor resonator with active centers, for which the condition 1S CAV T T is also met this model is an acoustic analog of the deterministic model for class B lasers . In this paper, we will limit ourselves in our numerical modeling by a relatively simple case of a three level active system. Although we used experimentally a more complex four level system Fig.1 , which allowed us to substantially enhance the inversion. Let us consider a three level spin system 3 2 1 E E , where signal transition 1 2 E E S transition is allowed for interaction with a coherent microwave acoustic field hypersound of specified direction and polarization, and the pumping transition 1 3 E E is allowed for magneto dipole interactions with the corresponding pumping field. The third transition F transition is an idle no load one, and its frequency 3 2 F E E is, by definition, not equal to the frequency of S transition 2 1 S E E or its multiple values. In addition, F is not an integer divisor of the P transition frequency 3 1 P E E . In the impurity paramagnetic Cr3 Al2O3, where the ground state orbital quantum number , spin see Fig.1 is weakly bonded with the lattice just by spin orbital interaction , longitudinal relaxation times 1 1 1 , , S P F T T T for all the above mentioned transitions at low temperatures are many orders of magnitude higher than the respective latitudinal relaxation times 2 2 2 , , S P F T T T . Consequently, it is possible to choose the amplitude of microwave electromagmetic pumping field 1P H such as to make populations 1 n 3 n of spin levels 1 E equal, but with broadening of these levels still the same as at 1 0 P . In other words, we assume that the following two inequalities hold simultaneously 2 1 1 1 P P P P Z T T Z or, in a somewhat different form 1 2 1 P P P P Y T Y T , where P Z is saturation factor of P transition 2 2 1 2 1 1 4 P P P P P Z T T , and P Y is interaction probability of the pumping field with the P transition. Here P is effective gyromagnetic ratio for this spin transition accounting for direction and polarization of vector 1P H G . Besides this, phonon life time CAV T in an FPAR of high Q factor does normally meet the 99 requirement 1 2 S CAV S T T T . Similar inequalities are true for photon life times in a microwave electromagnetic pumping resonator. In addition, it is usually assumed that the pumping resonator has no intrinsic frequencies in the vicinity of F . In this case, to calculate the difference in populations 2 1 N n n on S transition, one could use the balance approximation equations, which, accounting for equality 3 1 n , can be presented in the following form 2 12 1 32 1 2 2 1 21 2 31 1 1 1 S S dn W n W n W n Y N dt dn W n

Queries:
1. What are the observed transitions between SE chaotic modes and their relation to hysteretic transitions?
2. How does the deterministic SE model in a high Q factor resonator with active centers differ from the deterministic model for class B lasers?
3. What role does the three level active system play in clarifying the mechanisms of branching of SE modes and appearance of variable refractority in chaotic realizations of pulse phonon generation?

## Answer:

1. The observed transitions between SE chaotic modes are of non-hysteretic character, unlike the hysteretic transitions between independent regular branches with different periods of movement.
2. The deterministic SE model in a high Q factor resonator with active centers involves a three-level spin system and focuses on acoustic analogs of class B laser models.
3. The three-level active system, when combined with a coherent microwave acoustic field hypersound, helps to clarify the mechanisms of branching of SE modes and the appearance of variable refractority in chaotic realizations of pulse phonon generation.

Riesz Thorin interpolation with the L2 L2 estimate gives the desired decay result. Step 4. Hyperbolic directions, small frequencies. Like for large hyperbolic frequencies we make use of the representation to separate hyperbolic and parabolic influences. As in the previous cases the existence of full asymptotic expansions imply that the projections P D are Lp bounded for . It remains to understand the model multiplier e it . Using Proposition 2.9 we have e it e C2t 2 2 such that after introducing polar co ordinates e it D f e it f 1 e it L1 S2 f 1 f 1 Z c 0 Z o o e C2t 2 2d d t 1 2 f 1 Z c 0 d t 1 2 f 1, t 1 for all f L1 R2 with supp f . Riesz Thorin interpolation with the L2 L2 estimate gives the desired decay result. Remark. 1. In non degenerate hyperbolic directions where the coupling function vanishes to order l cf. Example 2.4 case 3 we obtain by the same reasoning the weaker Lp Lq decay rate D Phyp D V t, q 1 t 1 2l 1 p 1 q V0 p,r. ANISOTROPIC THERMO ELASTICITY IN 2D 17 It remains to understand whether this weaker decay rate is also sharp or whether an application of stationary phase method may be used to improve this. We will discuss this in Section 3.2. 2. We can extend the estimate of Theorem 3.1 to the limit case , if we include the eigen projections P into the considered model multiplier and use just their boundedness instead of H ormander Mikhlin multiplier theorem. This is possible, because all the multiplier estimates were based on H older inequalities. So far we understood properties of solutions to the transformed problem for the vector valued function V t, x given by as V t, x Dt D1 2 D U t, x Dt D1 2 D U t, x t, x , where U t, x M T D U t, x is the elastic displacement after transformation with the diag onaliser of the elastic operator. Because M is unitary and homogeneous of degree zero this diagonaliser is Lp bounded for with bounded inverse. Thus we have DtU t, x M D 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 V t, x p A D U t, x M D 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 V t, x such that as corollary of Theorem 3.1 we obtain Corollary 3.2. Assume A1 to A4 and that the coupling functions vanish of first order in all hyperbolic directions. Then the solution U t, x and t, x to satisfy the a priori estimates DtU t, q p A D U t, q t, q 1 t 1 2 1 p 1 q U1 p,r 1 U2 p,r 0 p,r for dual indices p 1, 2 , , and Sobolev regularity 1 p 1 q . Remark. Including the diagonaliser M into the model multipliers of Theorem 3.1 allows to overcome the restriction on p and to extend this statement up to . We preferred this way of presenting the results because they allow to decouple both statements. Theorem 3.1 gives deeper insight into the asymptotic behaviour of solutions than Corollary 3.2 does. 3.2. Coupling functions vanishing to higher order.

In both cases the coupling functions aj do not vanish in these directions. If , the elastic system decouples directly into two wave equations with propagation speed . In this case all directions are degenerate. Example 2.4. For rhombic media we have to distinguish between three cases. Case 1. If the material constants satisfy 2 1 2 2 0, we are close to the cubic case and there exist eight hyperbolic directions given by 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 . Case 2. If we assume on the contrary that 2 1 2 2 0, only the four hyperbolic directions 1 . In the Cases 1 and 2 in each hyperbolic direction one of the coupling functions aj vanishes to first order. Case 3. In the borderline case 2 or 2 , but 1 2, three hyperbolic directions collapse to one. We have the four hyperbolic directions 1 , at two of them 1 if 2 the vanishing order of the coupling function is three. Rhombic media are degenerate if a 1 or 2 with degenerate direction 0, 1 T or 1, 0 T or b 0 weakly coupled case and 1 2 0 with degenerate directions determined by 2 1 1 2 2 2 or c exceptional case where all directions are degenerate. Proposition 2.2. Let the direction S1 be non degenerate and hyperbolic with respect to the index j0. Then the corresponding eigenvalues satisfy lim a2 j0 2 j0 q C iD for all non tangential limits with real constants C , D R, D 0. Furthermore, the imaginary part of the hyperbolic eigenvalue satisfies lim Im a2 j0 2 2 D2 2 C2 2D2 0, and thus vanishes like Im a2 j0 as for all 0. 6 MICHAEL REISSIG AND JENS WIRTH Proof.

In the case of isolated degenerate directions others are not of interest, because then the system is decoupled we can find a replacement for Proposition 2.1. Proposition 2.3. Let S1 be an isolated degenerate direction, 1 2 . Then the corresponding hyperbolic eigenvalues satisfy lim 1 2 1 2 a2 1 0, and, therefore, lim Im 1 2 0, lim 1 Re 1 2 a2 1 .

Chunk: , while for hyperbolic directions with respect to the index 2 three cases occur depending on the size of the coupling constant 2 1 2 2 2 , 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 , 2 1 2 1 2 . If the direction is degenerate, 1 2 , we have the eigenvalues p 1 and p 1 2. The existence of five distinct eigenvalues of the homogeneous principal part B1 for all parabolic and most hyperbolic directions allows us to calculate the full asymptotic expansion of the eigenvalues of B as 0. We will give only the first terms in detail, but provide the whole diagonalisation procedure. Assumption A4 guarantees the non degeneracy of B1 . Note that, even if A4 is violated the matrix B1 is diagonalisable as consequence of its block structure . Proposition 2.5. As 0 the eigenvalues of the matrix B behave as 0 i 2b0 O 3 , 2.18a j j i 2bj O 3 2.18b for all non degenerate directions, where the functions bj C S1 are given by b0 1 2a2 1 1 2a2 2 2 1 2a2 1 2 j 1 2 j 1 2 2a2 2 2 j 2 2 j 2 2 ! 1 0. Furthermore, bj 0 if is parabolic and bj0 0 if is hyperbolic with respect to the index j0. Proof. We apply a diagonalisation scheme in order to extract the spectral information for B . We assume that the eigenvalues are denoted such that 1 2 . Step 1. By Proposition 2.4 we know that the homogeneous first order part B1 has the distinct eigenvalues j j , which are ordered as 1 1 2 2 where equality holds only under the exceptions stated in Proposition 2.4 . We denote corresponding normalised and bi orthogonal left and right eigenvectors of the matrix B1 by je and e j . If we collect them in the matrices L 0e 1e 1e 2e 2e , 2.21a R e0 e 1 e 1 e 2 e 2 , 2.21b we have L R I and L B1 R D1 diag 0, 1 , 1 , 2 , 2 . Further we get L B2 R i b b , where b and b are vectors collecting the last entries b0 , b j and 0b , jb of the eigenvectors e0 , e j and 0e , je , respectively. 8 MICHAEL REISSIG AND JENS WIRTH The matrix B L B R D1 2i b b is diagonalised modulo O 2 as 0 and has a main part with distinct entries. We denote R 2i b b. Step 2. We construct a diagonaliser of B as 0 of the form Nk I k X jN j . For this we denote the k homogeneous part of R k by R k and its entries by R k ij . Then we set for , 2, . . . Dk 1 diag R k 1 , N k 0 R k 1 12 d1 d2 R k 1 15 d1 d5 R k 1 21 d2 d1 0 R k 1 25 d2 d5 ... ... ... ... R k 1 51 d5 d1 R k 1 52 d5 d2 0 , where dj are the entries of D1 . By construction we have the commutator relation D1 , N k Dk 1 R k 1 , such that R k 2 B Nk Nk k 1 X jDj R k 1 kB N k kN k k 1 X jDj Nk k 1Dk 1 R kN k kN k k 1 X jDj Nk I k 1Dk 1 O k 2 . Using Nk we see that for ck, ck sufficiently small, the matrix Nk is invertible and N 1 k B Nk k 1 X jDj O k 2 . Thus, the entries of Dj contain

Chunk: see in the H, HR coordinate system meaningful data is in , as non zero values of correspond to the degree of irreversibility along a given FORC. We have employed this capability to analyze the VS nucleation and annihilation for the 67 nm sample. The complex butterfly like pattern of Fig. 2 i now transforms into irreversible switching mainly along line scans 1 and 2 in Fig. 4 b , which correspond to FORC s starting at , respectively marked as bold with large open circles as starting points in Fig. 4 a . Along 8 line scan 1 , when applied field , vortices have already nucleated in most of the nanodots. With increasing field H, becomes non zero and increases with H and peaks at 1320 Oe. This corresponds to the annihilation of the vortices in majority of the nanodots, and eventually returns to zero near positive saturation. Line scan 2 starts at , where the majority, but not all, of the nanodots have been negatively saturated. As H is increased, a first maximum in is seen at , corresponding to the nucleation of vortices within the nanodots. Between 100 1450 Oe, is essentially zero, indicating reversible motion of the vortices through the nanodots. A second maximum is found at , as the vortices are annihilated. This is again followed by reversible behavior near positive saturation. Note that along line scan 1, the vortices are annihilated from the same side of the nanodot from which they first nucleated, and thus the net magnetization remains positive along line scan 2, the vortices nucleate on one side of the dot and are annihilated from the other, and consequently the net magnetization changes sign Fig. 4 a . Interestingly the annihilation field along line scan 2, 1450 Oe, is larger than that along line scan 1, 1320 Oe. It seems more difficult to drive a vortex across the nanodot and then annihilate it. The peaks in Fig. 4 b are rather broad, which is a manifestation of vortex nucleation and annihilation field distributions. Also note that the interactions among the VS dots are expected to be negligible due to the high degree of flux closure, as confirmed by simulations.29 9 IV. Simulations and Discussions For comparison, micromagnetic simulations have been carried out on nearly circular nanodots with 60 nm diameters and 20 nm thicknesses.30 We have used parameters appropriate for Fe exchange stiffness .1 10 11 J m, saturation magnetization .7 106 A m, and anisotropy constant .8 104 J m3 . Each polycrystalline nanodot is composed of 2 nm square cells that are 20 nm thick, where each cell is a different grain with a random easy axis. A small cut on one side of the nanodot generates two distinct annihilation fields that depend on which side of the nanodot the vortex annihilates from. This exercise models the fact that our fabricated dots are not perfectly circular.31 We have simulated FORC s generated by two nanodots with different orientations Fig. 4 c the edge cut in one is parallel, and in the other at a 45o angle, to the applied field. The simulated M H curves show abrupt magnetization changes, corresponding to the nucleation, propagation, and annihilation of vortices. The corresponding FORC distribution is shown in Fig. 4 d . Peaks in the simulated FORC distribution clearly indicate the nucleation and annihilation fields of the vortices which are apparent in Fig 4 c . Along line scan 1 of Fig. 4 d , a vortex is already nucleated at 2300 Oe upper right corner . Along line scan 2 with , a vortex is nucleated at 2450 Oe lower right corner . It is clear that the simulated FORC reproduces the key features of the experimentally obtained one in Fig. 4 b . Here the asymmetric dot shape is essential to obtain a different annihilation field along scan 2 than

Chunk: that along scan 1. We have simulated the angular dependence of nucleation and 10 annihilation fields in such circular dot with a small cut as the cut orientation is varied in a field. We find that for most angles it is harder to annihilate a vortex from the opposite side of its nucleation site. However, for a small range of angles near 45 it is actually slightly easier to annihilate from the opposite side. It is the combination of these two behaviors that gives rise to the negative positive negative trio of features in the lower right portion of the FORC distribution. The presence of similar features in the experimental data shown in Fig. 4 b thus illustrates that the FORC distribution is also sensitive to variations of dot shapes in the array. Because only two dots are simulated, the features in the FORC distribution are much sharper than the experimental data where distributions of vortex nucleation and annihilation fields are present. Including more dots in the simulation with different applied field orientations and size distributions would tend to broaden the features generated by the two dots simulated. Additionally, by selectively integrating the normalized FORC distribution20,21 corresponding to the SD phase the aforementioned ridge centered at low coercivity values in Fig. 2 , we can quantitatively determine the percentage of nanodots in SD state for each sample. The SD phase fraction is 100 , 43 , and 10 for the 52, 58, and 67 nm sample, respectively. Thus the 58 nm nanodots have a significant co existence of both SD and VS states. However, we do not observe clear evidence of any additional metastable phase.15 V. Conclusions In summary, we have used the FORC method to fingerprint the rich magnetization reversal behavior in arrays of 52, 58, and 67 nm sized Fe nanodots. 11 Distinctly different reversal mechanisms have been captured, despite only subtle differences in the major hysteresis loops. The 52 nm nanodots are in SD states. A coercivity distribution has been extracted, which agrees with calculations. The 67 nm dots reverse their magnetization via the nucleation and annihilation of vortices. Different fields are required to annihilate vortices from opposite sides of the dots. Quantitative measures of the vortex nucleation and annihilation fields have been obtained. OOMMF simulations confirm the experimental FORC distributions. The 58 nm sample shows coexistence of SD and VS reversal, without evidence of additional reversal mode. These results further demonstrate the FORC method as a simple yet powerful technique for studying magnetization reversal, due to its capability of capturing distributions of magnetic properties, sensitivity to irreversible switching, and the quantitative phase information it can extract.

2. How is source detection and exclusion based on count rate and source extent in ximage handled in GRB observations?
3. What are the pile-up corrections performed in GRB observations, and how does the source region adjustment for exposure CCD area affect the process?

In this academic text, the author describes the process of using the BADPIX FITS extension for background region creation in gamma-ray burst (GRB) observations. The author explains that an image of the background region is created, and the detect routine in ximage is used to identify any sources with a count rate 3 above the background level. For each source thus found, a circular region centred on the source with a radius equal to the source extent returned by ximage is excluded from the background region. The event list is then broken up into individual snapshots, the mean count rate during each snapshot is ascertained and used to determine an appropriate source region size. The values in Table 1 were determined by manual analysis of many GRB observations and reflect a compromise between minimising the background level while maximising the proportion of source

Chunk: for WT mode . If there are several separate intervals of pile up e.g., pile up lasts for several snapshots, or a flare causes the count rate to rise into the pile up r egime , they each have their own annular region. The inner radii of the annuli or size of the excluded region in WT mode are stored in the event list, so that in the production phase the count rate can be corrected for events lost by the exclusion of the central part of the PSF. The time dependent region files thus created are used to generate source and background event lists for this snapshot. This process is performed for every snapshot in every observa tion of the GRB, and the event lists are then combined to yield one source and one background event list for each XRT mode. Additionally, all PC mode event lists are merged for use in the presentation phase phase 3 2.2. Phase 2 Production Phase In this phase the data are first filtered so that only events with energy in the range 0.3 10 keV are included. For WT PC mode, only events with grades 0 2 0 12 are accepted. Each mode is then processed separately WT and PC mode data are not merged. The process described in this section occurs three times in parallel once on the entire dataset, once binning only soft photons with energies in the range 0.3 1.5 keV , and once binning only the hard photons 1.5 10 keV . The data are then binned and background subtracted. Since the source region is P.A. Evans et al. An online repository of Swift XRT light curves of GRBs. 5 dynamic and could change within a bin, each background pho ton is individually scaled to the source area the source radius used was saved in each event list during the preparation phase . A bin i.e. a point on the light curve is defined as the small est possible collection of events which satisfies the following criteria There must be at least C counts from the source event list. The bin must span at least 0.5 s in WT PC mode. The source must be detected at a significance of at least 3 . There must be no more events within the source region in this CCD frame For the energy resolved data, both the soft and hard data must meet these criteria individually to complete a bin. C, the minimum number of counts in the source region, is a dynamic parameter. Its default value of 30 for WT mode and 20 for PC mode is valid when the source count rate is one count per second. It scales with count rate, such that an order of magnitude change in count rate produces a factor of 1.5 change in C. This is done discretely, i.e. where 1 , WT mode , for 10 , . C must always be above 15 counts, so that Gaussian statistics remain valid. Note that C always refers to the number of measured counts, with no corrections applied, however rate refers to the corrected count rate see below . These values of C give poor signal to noise levels in the hardness ratio, so for the energy resolved data we require 2C counts in each band in order to create a bin. The second criterion the bin duration is in place to enable reasonable sampling of the background. For the third criterion we define the detection significance as N B, where N is the number of net counts from the source and B is the number of background counts scaled to the source area. Thus we require that a datapoint have .3 probability of being a background fluctuation before we regard it as real . The final criterion is used because the CCD is read out at dis crete times, thus all events

2. How is the size of the excluded region in WT mode determined?
3. What are the criteria for defining a bin in the light curve binning process?

Chunk: that occur between successive read outs i.e. within the same frame have the same time stamp. Thus, if the final event in one bin and the first event in the next were from the same frame, those bins would overlap. Apart from being cosmetically unpleasant, this will also make modelling the light curves much harder, and is thus avoided. At the end of a Swift snapshot, there may be events left over which do not yet comprise a full bin. These will be appended to the last full bin from this snapshot, if there is one, other wise they are carried over to the next snapshot. At the end of the event list, if there are still spare events, this bin is replaced with an upper limit on the count rate. This is calculated at the 3 i.e. 99.7 confidence level, using the Bayesian method cham pioned by Kraft, Burrows and Nousek . As the data are binned and background subtracted, the count rates are corrected for losses due to pile up, dead zones on the CCD i.e. bad pixels and bad columns and source pho tons which fell outside the source extraction region. This cor rection, which is applied on an event by event basis, is achieved by numerically simulating the PSF for the relevant XRT mode over a radius of 150 pixels, and summing it. It is then summed again, however this time, the value of any pixel in the simu lated PSF which corresponds to a bad pixel in the data is set to zero before the summation the lists of bad pixels and the times for which they were bad were saved in the preparation phase . Furthermore, only the parts of the PSF which were within the data extraction region are included. Taking the ratio of the com plete PSF to the partial PSF gives the correction factor. This method is analogous to using exposure maps and the xrtmkarf task, as is done when manually creating light curves. Alternative methods of using xrtmkarf give correction factors which differ by up to 5 we compared our correction factors with these, and found them to lie in the middle of this distribution. In addition to these corrections, we need to ensure that the exposure time is calculated correctly mode switching, or bins spanning multiple snapshots, will result in a bin duration which is much longer than the exposure time. This is done by using the Good Time Interval GTI information from the event lists if a bin spans multiple GTIs the dead times between GTIs are summed, and the result is subtracted from the bin duration to give the exposure time, which is used to calculate the count rate. The fractional exposure is defined as the exposure time divided by the bin duration. Finally, the data are written to ASCII files. The following information is saved for each bin Time in seconds with errors . The bin time is defined as the mean photon arrival time, and the consequentially asym metric errors span the entire time interval covered by the bin. Time zero is defined as the BAT trigger time. For non Swift bursts, the trigger time given in the GCN circular which announced the GRB is used as time zero. Source count rate and error in counts s 1.

We have sdim g 1 2 2. The CTS par tial prolong g , g0, g 1 gives a graded Lie superalgebra with the property that g 1, g1 aff. From the description of irreducible modules over solvable Lie superalge bras Ssol , we see that the irreducible aff modules are 1 dimensional. For irreducible aff submodules g 1 in g 1 we have two possibilities to take g for both of them, g 1 is purely odd and we can never get a simple Cartan prolong. ii Denote by g 1 the g0 module generated by V 1 . We have sdim g 1 2 2. The CTS partial prolong g , g0, g 1 returns osp 2 4 . 1.9. A description of Bj 2 4 . We consider 3 g 2 3 with 1, 0, 0 . In this case, sdim g 2, 3 2 4.

A direct computation gives g1, g1 g2 and g 1, g1 g0. SuperLie tells us that this Lie superalgebra has three ideals I1 I2 I3 with the same non positive part but different positive parts sdim I1 10 14, sdim I2 11 14, sdim I3 12 14.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0132v2 cond mat.mes hall 3 Sep 2007 Counterflow of electrons in two isolated quantum point contacts V.S. Khrapai,1, 2 S. Ludwig,1 J.P. Kotthaus,1 H.P. Tranitz,3 and W. Wegscheider3 1Center for NanoScience and Department f ur Physik, Ludwig Maximilians Universit at, Geschwister Scholl Platz 1, D 80539 M unchen, Germany 2Institute of Solid State Physics RAS, Chernogolovka, 142432, Russian Federation 3Institut f ur Experimentelle und Angewandte Physik, Universit at Regensburg, D 93040 Regensburg, Germany We study the interaction between two adjacent but electrically isolated quantum point contacts QPCs . At high enough source drain bias on one QPC, the drive QPC, we detect a finite electric current in the second, unbiased, detector QPC. The current generated at the detector QPC always flows in the opposite direction than the current of the drive QPC. The generated current is maximal, if the detector QPC is tuned to a transition region between its quantized conductance plateaus and the drive QPC is almost pinched off. We interpret this counterflow phenomenon in terms of an asymmetric phonon induced excitation of electrons in the leads of the detector QPC. PACS numbers 73.23. b, 73.23.Ad, 73.50.Lw The state of a confined quantum system is modified by interactions with an external field or with exter nal sources of energy . In semiconductor nanostruc tures the energy and quasi momentum of electrons act ing as probe are strongly influenced by the environment, e. g. via electron electron or electron phonon interaction. If driven out of equilibrium, Coulomb forces establish the local equilibrium within the electron system whereas electron phonon interactions dominate the energy ex change with the environment . Drag experiments in semiconductor nanostructures provide a tool to study the effect of external electrons or phonons onto a probe elec tron system. Current drag between parallel two dimensional 2D electron layers has been investigated in GaAs AlGaAs bilayer systems. At small interlayer separations, ob servations are consistent with the Coulomb drag phe nomenon . At larger separations virtual phonon ex change has been invoked to explain the data . A neg ative sign of a current drag between 2D and 3D electron gases in GaAs was explained by the Peltier effect . At high filling factors in a perpendicular magnetic field a sign change of the longitudinal drag between parallel 2D layers was found as a function of the imbalance of the electron density in the two layers . Interactions between two lateral quantum wires in GaAs have been investigated in Ref. . The observed frictional drag, strongly oscillating as a function of the one dimensional 1D subband occupation, was inter preted in terms of Coulomb interaction between two Luttinger liquids. Recently, the observation of negative Coulomb drag between two disordered lateral 1D wires in GaAs in perpendicular magnetic fields was reported . Here we report on a novel interaction effect between two neighboring quantum point contacts QPCs , em bedded in mutually isolated electric circuits. When a strong current is flowing through the partially transmit ting drive QPC, we detect a small current in the sec ond, unbiased, detector QPC. The detector current flows in the opposite direction of the drive current and shows a nonlinear dependence on the source drain bias of the drive QPC. It oscillates as a function of the detector QPC transmission. We suggest an explanation of this counterflow phenomenon in terms of asymmetric phonon induced excitation of ballistic electrons in the leads of the detector QPC. Our samples are prepared on a GaAs AlGaAs het erostructure containing a two dimensional electron gas 90 nm below the surface, with an electron density of .8 1011 cm 2 and a low temperature mobility of 1.4 106 cm2 Vs. An AFM micrograph of the split gate nanostructure, produced with e beam lithogra phy, is shown in the left inset of Fig. 1. The split gate is used to define the QPCs. The gate voltages for the QPCs are optimized to obtain the best separation between the quantized conductance plateaus. The drive QPC is biased with a source drain voltage VSD , while the detector QPC is voltage biased by applying a voltage VD to the leads.

Chunk: a strong continuum agree with the notion that the Cloverleaf is energetically dominated by its AGN. The detection of PAH features with several mJy peak flux density in a z 2.6 galaxy, however, implies intense star formation, which we discuss in conjunction with other properties of the Cloverleaf. By fitting a Lorentzian superposed on a local polynomial continuum, we measure a flux of 1.52 10 21W cm 2 for the 6.2 m feature, with a S N of 6. The 7.7 m feature is more difficult to quantify. Schweitzer et al. have discussed PAHs as star formation indicators in local PG QSOs, PAHs are also detected in the average QSO spectrum of Hao et al. . The AGN continuum of those QSOs shows superposed silicate emission features at 9 m see also Siebenmorgen et al. 2005 Hao et al. 2005 . If PAH emission is additionally present, the PAH features partly fill in the minimum in the AGN emission before the onset of the silicate feature see Fig. 2 of Schweitzer et al. , causing a seemingly flat overall spectrum. In reality, there is simultaneous presence of AGN continuum, the 6.2 8.6 m PAH complex, silicate emission, and more PAH emission at longer wavelengths. From inspection of Fig. 2, a similar co presence of PAH and silicate emission is observed for the Cloverleaf. We note that the presence of silicate emission in the luminous Cloverleaf Type 1 QSO, other high z Type 1 QSOs Maiolino et al., in prep as well as in luminous Type 2 QSOs Sturm et al. 2006 Teplitz et al. 2006 has implications for the location of this cool silicate component 200K, Hao et al. 2005 in unified AGN schemes. We leave further discussion of the properties of silicates to a future paper. For the 7.7 m feature of the Cloverleaf, we adopt a flux of 6.1 10 21W cm 2. This flux was determined by scaling a PAH template ISO spectrum of M82, Sturm et al. 2000 to the measured Cloverleaf 6.2 m feature flux, and then fitting three lorentzians to represent the 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 features plus a local polynomial continuum to this template. Similar Lorentzian fits were also used for local comparison objects discussed below. Brandl et al. have quantified the scatter of the 6.2 to 7.7 m flux ratio in starbursts, with 0.07 in the log this scatter indicates the modest uncertainty induced by tying the longer wavelength features to the 6.2 m one. The result of subtracting the scaled M82 template from the Cloverleaf spectrum is indicated 5 in Fig. 2, and shows a combination of continuum and silicate emission very similar to local QSOs. Directly measuring the 7.7 m flux by fitting a single Lorentzian plus local continuum to the Cloverleaf spectrum gives a 40 lower feature flux, which would be a systematic underestimate because of the complexity of the underlying continuum silicates discussed above. 3. Intense star formation in the host of the Cloverleaf QSO The Cloverleaf SED Fig. 1 shows strong rest frame far infrared emission in addition to the AGN heated dust emitting in the rest frame mid infrared. Wei et al. decom posed the SED into two modified blackbodies of temperature 50 and 115 K, the rest frame far infrared 40 120 m luminosity of 5.4 1012L is dominated by the colder component and could largely originate in star formation. Comparison of PAH and far infrared emission can shed new light on this question. The bolometric rather than rest frame far infrared luminosity of the Cloverleaf will still be dominated by the AGN. We estimate LBol extrap olating from the observed rest frame 6 m continuum which for a mid infrared spectrum with weak PAH but strong continuum will be AGN dominated. We note that the PAH luminosity of the Cloverleaf is LPAH 1.5 1022W is comparable to the average QSOs of Hao et al. 2005, see Fig. 11. We then determine the PAH to far infrared luminosity ratio, LPAH / LFIR, which is a useful quantity to compare the relative importance of star formation and AGN heating in the Cloverleaf. The result is 1.1 10 -4. If this value is comparable to local QSOs, then star formation plays a major role in the Cloverleaf SED.

Evolution of shear pressure tensors We have assumed that initially the shear pressure ten sors xx, yy and xy attained their longitudinal boost invariant values. As the fluid evolve, pressure tensors also evolve. Here we investigate the evolution of shear pres sure tensors with time. In the top panel of Fig.7 evolu tion of shear pressure tensor xx at the fluid cell position 0 is shown. The black line is for the ADS CFT motivated viscosity, .08 and the red line is for the perturbative estimate of viscosity .135. Just after the start of the evolution the shear pressure tensor xx increases, but for a short duration and then steadily de creases with time. By 4 fm of evolution, xx at the center of the fluid reduces to negligibly small values. Identical behavior is seen for the shear pressure tensor yy. In the bottom panel of Fig.7 we have shown the evolution of the third independent shear pressure tensor xy. Ini tially xy is zero. As the fluid evolve, it grow in the negative direction. We find that at the centre of the fluid 8 0 , it never grows. In Fig.7, temporal evolution of xy at the fluid cell position 5fm is shown. From the initial zero value, xy rapidly increases in the negative direction. It reaches its maximum around 1 fm and then decreases again. We also note that xy never grows to large values. Compared to xx or yy stress ten sor xy is negligible. The results indicate that in a QGP fluid, viscous effect persist for a short duration 3 4 fm only. At late time the fluid evolve essentially as an ideal fluid. The result is understandable. Shear viscosity de pend strongly on temperature T 3 . As the fluid cools, effect of viscosity decreases rapidly. fm 0 2 4 6 8 10 average entropy 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 .08 .135 FIG. 9 Evolution of average entropy with time, for two val ues of viscosity, the ADS CFT motivated viscosity .08 and perturbative estimate .135 are shown. To show the spatial distribution of the stress tensors, in Fig.8, xx and yy at initial time .6 fm and after an evolution of 2.6 fm are shown. As shown earlier, xx and also yy rapidly decreases with time. By 2 fm of evolution they are reduced by approximately by a fac tor 6. It is also interesting to note that the initial x y symmetric distribution of xx and yy quickly evolves to asymmetric distribution. With time xx evolves faster in the x direction than in y direction. Similarly, yy evolve faster in the y direction than in the x direction. For cen tral collisions the asymmetric evolution of xx and yy counter balance each other. As shown in Fig.1 and 2, the contour plots of energy density do not show any in dication of asymmetry even at late time. However, the asymmetric pressure tensors can have important effects on elliptic flow of observables produced early in the col lisions, say in elliptic flow of direct photons. C. Entropy generation In a viscous fluid dynamics, entropy is generated. We can easily calculate the entropy generated during the evo lution, S 2 T 2 xx 2 yy 2 2 2 . The total entropy generated is shown in Fig. 9. The entropy generation is larger for the larger viscosity value. . The entropy generated per unit proper time is shown in the figure, averaged over the entire space. The entropy generated is seen to decrease with time. It is also seen that the entropy generation is larger for the larger viscosity value. The entropy generation per unit proper time is shown in the figure, averaged over the entire space. The entropy generated is seen to decrease with time. It is also seen that the entropy generation is larger for the larger viscosity value. The entropy generation per unit proper time is shown in the figure, averaged over the entire space. The entropy generated is seen to decrease with time. It is also seen that the viscous effect persists for a short duration 2 3 fm only and after that the fluid evolves essentially as an ideal fluid. The results are understandable, as the shear viscosity depends strongly on temperature. As the fluid cools, the effect of viscosity decreases rapidly.

Chunk: Fig.9, for the two values of viscosity coefficients .08 and 0.135. As expected, entropy generation is more if vis cosity is more. For both the values of viscosity, we find that entropy generation saturates after 3 fm of evolu tion. It is expected also. As shown previously, viscous fluxes reduces to very small values after 3 fm.

In Fig.11, average en tropy evolution with proper time is shown, both for the 1st order theory the solid line and the 2nd order theory. In 2nd order theory, approximately 80 more entropy is generated. VII. TRANSVERSE MOMENTUM AND ELLIPTIC FLOW OF QUARKS Presently we can not compare predictions from viscous hydrodynamics with experimental data. Hadrons are not included in the model. The initial QGP fluid evolve and cools but remain in the QGP phase, it did not undergo a phase transition to hadronic gas. However, from the momentum distribution of quarks we can get some idea about the viscous effect on particle production. Viscos ity generates entropy, which will be reflected in enhanced multiplicity. We use the standard Cooper Frey prescrip tion to obtained the transverse momentum distribution of quarks. In Cooper Frey prescription, particle distribu tion is obtained by convoluting the one body distribution function over the freeze out surface, E dN d3p Z d p f x, p where d is the freeze out hyper surface and f x, p is the one body distribution function. Now in a viscous dy namics, the fluid is not in equilibrium and f x, p can not be approximated by the equilibrium distribution func tion, f x, p 1 exp u p 1, with inverse temperature 1 T and chemical poten tial . In a highly non equilibrium system, distribution function f x, p is unknown. If the system is slightly off equilibrium, then it is possible to calculate correction to equilibrium distribution function due to small non equilibrium effects. Slightly off equilibrium distribution function can be approximated as, f x, p f x, p 1 x, p , x, p is the deviation from equilibrium distribution function f . With shear viscosity as the only dissi pative forces, x, p can be locally approximated by a quadratic function of 4 momentum, x, p p

Chunk: 1 Compounding Fields and Their Quantum Equations in the Trigintaduonion Space Zihua Weng School of Physics and Mechanical Electrical Engineering, P. O. Box 310, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China Abstract The 32 dimensional compounding fields and their quantum interplays in the trigintaduonion space can be presented by analogy with octonion and sedenion electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions, the study deduces some conclusions of field source particles quarks and leptons and intermediate particles which are consistent with current some sorts of interaction theories. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the hyper strong and strong weak fields, the paper draws some predicts and conclusions of the field source particles sub quarks and intermediate particles. The research results show that there may exist some new particles in the nature. Keywords sedenion space strong interaction weak interaction quark sub quark. 1. Introduction Nowadays, there still exist some movement phenomena which can t be explained by current sub quark field theories. Therefore, some scientists bring forward some new field theories to explain the strange phenomena in the strong interaction and weak interaction etc. A new insight on the problem of the sub quark movement and their interactions can be given by the concept of trigintaduonion space. According to previous research results and the SpaceTime Equality Postulation 1 5 , the eight sorts of interactions in the paper can all be described by quaternion spacetimes. Based on the conception of space verticality etc., these eight types of quaternion spacetimes can be united into the 32 dimensional trigintaduonion space. In the trigintaduonion space, the characteristics of eight sorts of interactions can be described by single trigintaduonion space uniformly. By analogy with the octonionic and sedenion fields, four sorts of trigintaduonion fields which consist of octonionic fields H S, S W and E G etc., can be obtained in the paper. The paper describes the trigintaduonion fields and their quantum theory, and deduces some predicts and new conclusions which are consistent with the current sub quark theories etc. E mail Addresses xmuwzh hotmail.com, xmuwzh xmu.edu.cn 2 2. Compounding fields in trigintaduonion spaces Through the analysis of the different fields in the octonionic and sedenion spaces, we find that each interaction possesses its own spacetime, field and operator in accordance with the SpaceTime Equality Postulation . In the sedenion spaces, sixteen sorts of sedenion fields can be tabulated in Table 1, including their operators, spaces and fields. Table 1.

Chunk: I, II, III and IV also present the kludge values of the fluxes d dt and d inc dt as computed using Eqs. and for dE dt and dLz dt, plus Eq. for dQ dt. Though certainly not the last word on inclination evolution pending rigorous computation of dQ dt , these rates of change proba bly represent a better approximation than results published to date in the literature. Indeed, prior work has often used the crude approximation d . Most significantly, we find that d dt d inc dt . In other words, we find that d dt and d inc dt do not ever change sign. Finally, in Table V we compute the changes in inc and for the inspiral with mass ratio . In all cases, we start at p .9. The small body then inspirals through the nearly horizon skimming region until it reaches the sep aratrix at this point, the small body will fall into the large black hole on a dynamical timescale M, so we terminate the calculation. The evolution of circular orbits is computed using our fits to the circular Teukolsky fluxes of E and Lz for eccentric orbits we use the kludge fluxes , and . As this exercise demonstrates, the change in inclination during inspiral is never larger than a few degrees. Not only is there no unique sign change in the nearly horizon skimming region, but the magnitude of the inclination change remains puny. This leaves little room for the possibility that this class of orbits may have a clear observational imprint on the EMRI waveforms to be detected by LISA. VI. CONCLUSIONS We have performed a detailed analysis of the orbital mo tion near the horizon of near extremal Kerr black holes. We have demonstrated the existence of a class of orbits, which we have named non circular nearly horizon skimming orbits , for which the angular momentum Lz increases with the or bit s inclination, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed. This behavior, in stark contrast to that of Newtonian orbits, generalizes earlier results for circular orbits . Furthermore, to assess whether this class of orbits can pro duce a unique imprint on EMRI waveforms an important source for future LISA observations , we have studied, in the adiabatic approximation, the radiative evolution of incli nation angle for a small body orbiting in the nearly horizon skimming region. For circular orbits, we have re examined the analysis of Ref. using an improved code for comput ing Teukolsky based fluxes of the energy and angular momen tum. Significantly correcting Ref. s results, we found no decrease in the orbit s inclination angle. Inclination always increases during inspiral. We next carried out such an analysis for eccentric nearly horizon skimming orbits. In this case, we used kludge fluxes to evolve the constants of motion E, Lz and Q . We find that these fluxes are fairly accurate when compared with the available Teukolsky based fluxes, indicating that they should provide at least qualitatively correct information re garding inclination evolution. As for circular orbits, we find that the orbit s inclination never decreases. For both circular and non circular configurations, we find that the magnitude of the inclination change is quite paltry only a few degrees at 9 most. Quite generically, therefore, we found that the inclination angle of both circular and eccentric nearly horizon skimming orbits never decreases during the inspiral. Revising the results obtained in Ref. , we thus conclude that such orbits are not likely to yield a peculiar, unique imprint on the EMRI waveforms detectable by LISA.

Chunk: Lz p, e, inc inc between 0 and max inc . Region C contains Region B, and is illustrated in Fig. 2 as the area under the heavy solid line and to the left of the dashed line blue in the color version . 6 Figure 2 Left panel Non circular nearly horizon skimming orbits for .998M. The heavy solid line indicates the separatrix between stable and unstable orbits for equatorial orbits . All orbits above and to the left of this line are unstable. The dot dashed line green in the color version bounds the region of the p, e plane where Lz Region A . All orbits between this line and the separatrix belong to Region A. The dotted line red in the color version bounds the region Lz most Lz least bound Region B . Note that B includes A. The dashed line blue in the color version bounds the region where Lz Region C note that C includes B. All three of these regions are candidate generalizations of the notion of nearly horizon skimming orbits. Right panel Same as the left panel, but for the extreme spin case, . In this case the separatrix between stable and unstable equatorial orbits is given by the line p . Orbits in any of these three regions give possible general izations of the nearly horizon skimming circular orbits pre sented in Ref. . Notice, as illustrated in Fig. 2, that the size of these regions depends rather strongly on the spin of the black hole. All three regions disappear altogether for .9524M in agreement with their sizes grow with a, reaching maximal extent for . These regions never extend beyond p 2M. As we shall see, the difference between these three regions is not terribly important for assessing whether there is a strong signature of the nearly horizon skimming regime on the inspi ral dynamics. As such, it is perhaps most useful to use Region C as our definition, since it is the most inclusive. IV. EVOLUTION OF inc CIRCULAR ORBITS To ascertain whether nearly horizon skimming orbits can affect an EMRI in such a way as to leave a clear imprint in the gravitational wave signal, we have studied the time evolution of the inclination angle inc. To this purpose we have used the so called adiabatic approximation , in which the infalling body moves along a geodesic with slowly changing parame ters. The evolution of the orbital parameters is computed us ing the time averaged fluxes dE dt, dLz dt and dQ dt due to gravitational wave emission radiation reaction . As dis cussed in Sec. II, E, Lz and Q can be expressed in terms of p, e, and inc. Given rates of change of E, Lz and Q, it is then straightforward to calculate dp dt, de dt, and d inc dt or d dt . We should note that although perfectly well behaved for all bound stable geodesics, the adiabatic approximation breaks down in a small region of the orbital parameters space very close to the separatrix, where the transition from an inspiral to a plunging orbit takes place . However, since this region is expected to be very small2 and its impact on LISA wave forms rather hard to detect , we expect our results to be at least qualitatively correct also in this region of the space of parameters. Accurate calculation of dE dt and dLz dt in the adiabatic approximation involves solving the Teukolsky and Sasaki Nakamura equations . For generic orbits this has been done for the first time in Ref. . The calculation of dQ dt for generic orbits is more involved. A formula for dQ dt has been recently derived , but has not yet been implemented at least in a code to which we have access . On the other hand, it is well known that a

1. What is the relationship between Region C, Region B, and Region A in the context of nearly horizon skimming orbits?
2. How do the sizes of Regions A, B, and C depend on the spin of the black hole?
3. How does the adiabatic approximation affect the time evolution of the inclination angle inc in nearly horizon skimming orbits?

Note: The queries are generated based on the information provided in the chunk. The chunk describes different regions and their relationship to each other and their dependency on the spin of the black hole. It also mentions the adiabatic approximation in its relation to the inclination angle inc.

The search queries are all about the key points mentioned in the chunk. The first one is about the relationship between the regions. The second one is about the dependency of the regions on the spin of the black hole. The third one is about the effect of the adiabatic approximation on the time evolution of the inclination angle inc. 

These queries are concise and cover the main points of the chunk. They are formulated in a way that should provide useful information for conducting further research on the topic.

Chunk: transformed their BSS catalog in our astrometric system, and we have found that 50 BSS of their bright sample lie at r 115 35 are from the HST sample, 13 from the Canada France Hawaii Telescope CFHT data set, and 2 from the Cerro Tololo Inter American Observatory CTIO sample in the outer regions 115 9 BSS are identified, all from the CTIO data set. By cross correlating W06 bright sample with our catalog we have found 43 BSS in common see Table 1 , 37 at r 115 and 6 outward. In particular, 33 BSS out of the 41 i.e., 80 of the total that we have identified in the WFPC2 HST sample5 are found in both catalogs, while 3 of our BSS belong 5 to their faint BSS sample namely, BSS 27, 34, and 40, corresponding to their Core BSS 70, 79, and 76, respectively , 5 of our BSS have been missed in W06 paper, and 2 objects in their sample are classified as HB stars in our study. This is probably due to different selection criteria, and or small differences in the measured magnitudes, caused by the different data reduction procedures and photometric analysis. For example, W06 identify the BSS on the basis of both the UV and the optical observations, while we select the BSS only in the UV plane whenever possible. Out of the other 15 BSS found at r 115 in the ground based CFHT CTIO sample of W06, 8 BSS Core BSS 38 45 in their Table 2 clearly are false identifications. They are arranged in a very unlikely ring around a strongly saturated star, as can be seen in Figure 8, where the position in the sky of the 8 spurious BSS are overplotted on the CFHT image. Though they 4The observations presented here do not have the time coverage needed to properly search for BSS variability. 5Note that the WFPC2 HST observations used in W06 and in the present study are the same. 9 clearly are spurious identifications, they still define a clean sequence in the B, B I CMD, nicely mimicking the BSS magnitudes and colors. As already discussed in previous papers, this once again demonstrates how automatic procedures for the search of peculiar objects are prone to errors, especially when using ground based observations to probe very crowded stellar regions. We emphasize that all the candidate BSS listed in our Table 1 have been visually inspected evaluating the quality and the precision of the PSF fitting. This procedure significantly reduces the possibility of introducing spurious objects in the sample. Out of the remaining 7 BSS, 4 objects namely their Core BSS 32, 30, 37 and 28 are also confirmed by our ACS observations BSS 42, 43, 44, and 45 respectively , while 2 others their Core BSS 27 and Ground BSS 6 are not found in the ACS data set, and the remaining one their Ground BSS 7 is not included in our observation FoV. In turn, two BSS identified in our ACS data set BSS 46 and 47 are missed in their sample. Concerning the BSS lying at 115 , 6 objects out of 9 found in both samples are in common between the two catalogs see Table 1 , one BSS 55 belongs to W06 faint sample their Ground BSS 23 , while the remaining 2 do not coincide. Moreover, 4 additional BSS have been identified at in our study. 3.2. The reference population Since the HB sequence is bright and well separable in the UV and optical CMDs, we chose these stars as the primary representative population of normal cluster stars to be used for the comparison with the BSS data set. As with the BSS, the HB sample was first defined in the m255, m255 U plane, and the corresponding selection box in B, B V has then been determined by using the stars

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0141v1 hep ph 2 Apr 2007 Towards self consistent definition of instanton liquid parameters S.V. Molodtsov1,2, G.M. Zinovjev3 1Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, RU 141980, Dubna, Moscow region, Russia 2Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics, RU 117259, Moscow, Russia 3Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, UA 03680, Kiev 143, Ukraine The possibility of self consistent determination of instanton liquid parameters is discussed to gether with the definition of optimal pseudo particle configurations and comparing the various pseudo particle ensembles. The weakening of repulsive interactions between pseudo particles is argued and estimated. The problem of finding the most effective pseudo particle profile for instanton liquid IL model of the QCD vacuum has already been formulated in the first papers treating the pseudo particle superposition as the quasi classical configuration saturating the generating functional of the fol lowing form A e S A , where S A is the Yang Mills action. Although the solution proposed in Ref. was quite acceptable phenomenologically the consequent more accurate analysis discovered several imperfect conclusions putting into doubt the assertion about the instanton ensemble getting stabilization and some addi tional mechanism should be introduced to fix such an ensemble . In this note we revisit the task formulated in Ref. within the self consistent approach proposed in our previous paper . We are not speculating on the detailed mechanism of stabilizing and are based on one crucial assumption which is the existence of non zero gluon condensate in the QCD vacuum. This idea is not very orig inal but turns out far reaching in the context of our approach. The particular form and properties of this condensate will be discussed in the following paper. Thus, as the configuration saturating the generating functional we take the following super position Aa x Ba x N X x i , here Aa stands for the anti instanton field in the singular gauge Aa x 2 g ab b y y2 f y , , i, zi, i denotes all the parameters describing the i th anti instanton, in particular, its size , colour orientation , center position z and as usual g is the coupling constant of gauge field. The function f y introduces the pseudo particle profile and will be fixed by resolving the suitable variational problem. For example, for the conventional singular instanton it looks like f y 1 1 y2 2 . 1 In analogy with this form we consider the function f depending on y2 or, more precisely, on the variable 2 at some characteristic mean pseudo particle size . Dealing with the anti instanton one should make the substitution of the t Hooft symbol . It is seen from we singled out one pseudo particle of ensemble and introduced the special symbol B for its field which actually has the same form as Eq. . The strength tensor of this external field and the field of every separate pseudo particle A can be written as Ga Ga B Ga A Ga A, B , where two first terms are given by the standard definition of field strength Ga A Aa Aa g f abcAb Ac , with the entirely antisymmetric tensor f abc. In particular, for the singular instanton of Eq. it takes the form Ga 4 g ak k f 1 f y2 k y k y y y2 f f 1 f y2 ! , where f means the derivative over y2. The third term of Eq. presents the mixed component of field strength and is Ga A, B g f abc Bb Ac Bb Ac g f abc cd 2 g Bb d Bb d y y2 f. It was shown in Ref. that in quasi classical regime which is of particular interest for appli cations, the generating functional could be essentially simplified if reformulated in terms of the field BA averaged over ensemble A.

Chunk: Performing the cluster decomposition of stochastic exponent in Eq. 1 k k! z ! , , , . . . the first cumulant is simply defined by averaging the action the higher terms of effective action for the external field in IL could be presented as BA G BA 4 m2 2 B2 A ! , and the mass m is defined by the IL parameters developing for the standard singular pseudo particles the following form see, also below 2 n 2 Nc N2 c 1 , with . The small magnitude of characteristic IL parameter packing fraction n 4 allows us at decomposing to keep the contributions of one pseudo particle term n only. The effective action in Eq. implies a functional integration in which the vacuum stochastic fields are not destroyed by the external field. Then there is no reason to develop the detailed description of the field B driven by the symmetries of initial gauge invariant Lagrangian for the Yang Mills fields. In practice it could be understood as an argument to do use the averaged action dealing with the field B. It means the colourless binary and similar even configurations only of field B survive in the effective action. In other words the decomposition B BA is used in what follows we are not maintaining the index for the field B . Obviously, if there is any need 2 of more detailed description including, for example, information on the fluctuations of field B one should operate with the correlation functions of higher order and the corresponding chain of the Bogolyubov equations. The selfconsistent description of pseudo particle ensemble may not be developed based on Eq. only because in such a form the pseudo particles of zero size 0 are most advantageous. In Ref. the version of variational principle was proposed which makes it possible to determine the selfconsistent solution in long wave length approximation for the pseudo particle ensemble anti instantons in the singular gauge with standard profile and external field. Here it adapts to the saturating configuration also and its more optimal than standard profile is defined, as suggested in Ref. , taking into account the IL parameter change while the pseudo particle field is present. The contribution of saturating configuration into the generating functional is evaluated as see for the denotions Z B 1 N! Z N Y i e S B, . The following terms should be taken into consideration S B, N X i Uint N X B S B , the details of deducing this expression can be found in . Here we remind only that to obtain it one should average over the pseudo particle parameters and to hold the highest contributions only at summing up the pseudo particles. If the saturating configurations are the instantons in singular gauge with the standard profile the first term describing the one instanton contributions takes the form of distribution function over anti instanton sizes d CNc b b 5 e 2Nc, where , e b ln , CNc 4.66 exp 1.68Nc 2 Nc 1 ! Nc 2 ! . If one considers the profile of Eq. the change of one pseudo particle action which has the form h y2f 2 f 2 1 f 2i , should be absorbed while calculating. Here 8 2 g2 is the characteristic action of single pseudo particle which is defined at the scale of average pseudo particle size where ln CNc b ln . The coefficient b enters the corresponding equations in particular the distribution function always with the additional factor . It means that in all the formula containing the one instanton contribution the following substitution b b s . should be done. The penultimate term of Eq. accumulates the partial pseudo particle contribu tions coming from the mixed component of the strength tensor and describing the interaction of pseudo particle ensemble with the detached one,

Chunk: a continuum limit in the above example has a general meaning. However, it makes sense only if there exists a deterministic relation between the configurations of x and J x or, in a mathematical notation, if there exist mappings f and f 1 . On the other hand, according to the block averaging, the values of x should be understood as the block averages. These, of course, are not uniquely determined by the external sources, but are fluctuating quantities. So, we are quite sceptical about the exactness of such an approach of averaged effective action. The integration over fluctuation degrees with momenta , directly related to the critical exponents. From this point of view, the approach based on the equations of Wegner Houghton and Polchinski type seems to be more natural. These are widely believed to be the exact RG equations, although, in view of our currently presented results, it turns out to be questionable in which sense they are really exact. In any case, the nonperturbative RG equations cannot be solved exactly, therefore a suitable truncation is used. The convergence of several truncation schemes and of the derivative expansion has been widely studied in . Here refers to the specific approach of . A review about all the methods of approximate solution can be found in . Another problem is to test and verify the nonperturbative RG equations, comparing the results with the known exact and rigorous solutions, as well as with the results of the perturbation theory. In , the derivative expansion of the RG function has been considered, showing the agreement up to the second order between the perturbative results and those obtained from the Legendre flow equation, which also belongs to the same class of RG equations as the Wegner Houghton and Polchinski equations. It has been stated in that the critical exponent , extracted from the Wegner Houghton equation in the local potential approximation, agrees with the expansion up to the O order, as well as with the 1 n 1 N in the notations of expansion in the leading order. However, looking carefully on the results of , one should make clear that the leading order of the 1 n expansion in this case is no more than the zeroth order, whereas the expansion coefficient at 1 n is inconsistent with that proposed by the perturbative RG calculation at any fixed dimension d except only . The inconsistency could be understood from the point of view that the Wegner Houghton equation has been solved approximately. Therefore it would be interesting to verify whether the problem is eliminated beyond the local potential approximation. One should also take into account that the perturbative RG theory is not rigorous and, therefore, we think that a possible inconsistency still would 2 not prove that something is really wrong with the nonperturbative RG equation. In any case, it is a remarkable fact that correct RG eigenvalue spectrum and critical exponents are obtained in the local potential approximation at n from the Wegner Houghton equation , as well as from similar RG equations , in agreement with the known exact and rigorous results for the spherical model. It shows that some solutions, being not exact, nevertheless can lead to exact critical exponents. From this point of view, it seems also possible that some kind of approximations, made in the derivation of an RG equation, are not harmful for the critical exponents. We propose a simple test of the Wegner Houghton equation to verify the expansion of the renormalized action S of the 4 model in powers of the coupling constant u at u 0 in the high temperature phase. Such a test is rigorous, in the sense that the natural domain of validity of the perturbation theory is considered. We think that it would be quite natural to start with such a relatively simple and straightforward test before passing to

Chunk: 2 1 2 2 , where 2 4 Nc N2 c 1. The factor that appears in the exponent in formula is also evaluated at the scale of an average size of pseudoparticles . Assuming that the instanton liquid is topologically neutral, we do not introduce notation to distinguish between instantons and anti instantons, N denotes the ovarall number of pseudoparticles in volume V . Since the interaction is independent of coordinates or orientation in color space, it is natural to calculate the generating functional Y on the basis of the effective one particle distribution function , which can be determined from the solution of the variational problem 1 V N N! N Y i X ! N Y i e E1 , E1 X ln i , where the factor V N in is isolated in order that the result be expressed in terms of the respective density and convenience in interpretation of the function . With regard to convexity of the exponential function, the generating functional for every fixed N partial contribution can be estimated using the approximating inequality Y 1 exp , where an average over approximate ensemble is implied. In the case under consideration, the average of difference is given by 1 Y 1 1 N! Z N Y i Uint X ln d i X ln i e P ln i N 0 Z d ln d 2 0 N V Z d 1d 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 ! , where . 2 Variation of the functional with respect to results formally in the equation e 1 d e n 2 2 2 where . Here an unwanted factor of e 1, emerges. It can be excluded due to the fact that the approximate functional Ya is independent of the constant factor of C that can be added to the expressionfor . For convenience, we set , and therefore, arrive at d e n 2 2 2 . Substituting this solution to the approximate functional, we obtain N 0 N! eN 2 2 2 2 . Defining suitable parameter the integral for determination 0 can be represented in the form 4 Z d CNc e 2Nc b 5 e 2 2 . From the comparison of which with formula we obtain 2n 2 . Provided that is known, this formula offers a relation between the average instanton size and the density of the instanton liquid. To find this relation, we consider the equation b 3 e 2 2 R d b 5 e 2 2 1 b 4 2 1 b 4 2 . which gives b 4 2 , and therefore, 4 CNc e 2Nc 2 2 . It should be noted that the factor of two in the denominator of this expression stems from the integration measure 2 d , which, in its turn, emerges in transformation to the Gaussian integral with respect to squired. This factor was omited in however, this fact has no noticeable consequences. The reason is that the parameter is determined from a fit to some observable, for example, to the pion decay constant. In so doing, everything is governed by a choice of scale. Moreover, it should be remembered that the instanton liquid model is merely a rough approximation. From the above, we derive an approximate expression for the functional as follows N 2 1 ln n 4 1 N ln CNc e 2Nc 2 2 2 . Now we find the value of n at which the argument of the exponential approaches its maximum. To do this, we should solve the equation 2 1 ln n 4 ln CNc e 2Nc 2 2 2 n 2Nc e d e dn n 2 d . From the relation we obtain 1 d d 1 n dn d 4 0 . On the other hand, d d b , d e d d d .

Chunk: all the wave functions n are localized, i.e., for a particular realization of disorder they behave as n exp n L . where n define the localization centers as in the Eq. , and L is the localization length which is of the same order of magnitude as the mean free path related to the strength of the disorder in the superpotential W . Let us now discuss how eternal inflation proceeds on islands where the typical number of adjacent vacua is larger than two. In the quasi two dimensional case the network of vacua within a given island is described by a composite index i, j . The distribution function for finding a given value of the cosmological constant in a given Hubble patch is a two dimensional matrix. Again, all the eigenstates of the corresponding tunneling hamil tonian H are localized. However, since the localization length grows exponentially with energy, the distribution function effectively spreads out almost linearly with t 1 c1 1 log t , where 0 are constants depending on the correlation properties of the disorder on the landscape . The low energy eigenstates namely, the states with are localized with a rela tively small localization length. In the quasi higher dimensional cases the distribution function spreads out according to the linear diffusion law at intermediate times. Again, there exists a mobility edge Eg such that the eigenstates of the tunneling Hamilto nian with energies . These low energy eigenstates define the asymptotics of the distri bution function at t E 1 g . The value of the mobility edge Eg strongly depends on the dimensionality of the island and the strength of the disorder, and the higher is the dimensionality, the lower is the mobility edge . Localization of the low energy eigenstates in two and higher dimensional cases introduces an effective dynam ical selection principle for different vacua on the land scape in the asymptotic future, not all of them will be populated, but only those near the localization centers n, and the probability to populate other minima will be suppressed exponentially according to the Eq. . It is interesting to note that in condensed matter sys tems the localization centers are typically located near the points where the effective potential has its deepest 4 minima . In the case of eternal inflation, it means that the probability to measure any but very low value of the cosmological constant in a given Hubble patch will be exponentially suppressed in the asymptotic future . Finally, we discuss the effect of sinks on the dynamics of tunneling between the vacua. On the string theory landscape, dS metastable vacua are typically realized by uplifting stable AdS vacua as, for example, in the well known KKLT model . The probability to tunnel from the uplifted dS state i back into the AdS vacuum is related to the value of gravitino mass m3 2 in the dS state and given by tAdS 1 is exp Const.M 2 P m2 3 2,i ! . The gravitino mass after uplifting has the order of magnitude m3 2,i VAdS,i 1 2 MP. Since at long time scales VAdS,i can also be regarded as a random quantity, our analysis of the general solution of vacuum dynam ics equations does not have to be modified in any essential way . In addition to AdS sinks, Hubble patches where eternal inflation has ended stochastic fluctuations of the infla ton expectation value became smaller than the effect of classical force also effectively play a role of sinks for the probability current described by the Eq. . In par ticular, the Hubble patch we live in is one of such sinks. Related to the effect of sinks, there exists a time scale tend for eternal inflation on the landscape such that the unitarity of the evolution of the probability distribution breaks down at t tend .

Chunk: in the classical regime. Such a de terministic nature of the constraint equation has been taken as a necessary condition for non singularity at the quantum level 2. As such this could be viewed as a criterion to limit the choice of factor ordering. By introducing an interpolating, slowly varying smooth function, p 1 6 l2 P , and keeping only the first non vanishing terms, one deduces the Wheeler De Witt differential equation with a modified matter Hamiltonian from the above difference equation. Making a WKB approximation, one infers an effective Hamiltonian which matches with the classical Hamiltonian for large volume 0 and small extrinsic curvature derivative of the WKB phase is small . There are terms of o 0 which contain arbitrary powers of the first derivative of the phase which can all be summed up. The resulting effective Hamiltonian now contains modifications of the classical gravitational Hamiltonian, apart from the modifications in the matter Hamiltonian due to the inverse powers of the triad. The largest possible domain of validity of effective Hamiltonian so deduced must have p p0 . An effective Hamiltonian can alternatively obtained by computing expectation values of 2 For contrast, if one just symmetrizes the non symmetric operator without the sgn factor , one gets a difference equation which is non deterministic. 8 the Hamiltonian operator in semiclassical states peaked in classical regimes .

For the symmetric operator, the effective Hamiltonian is the same as above except that B p f p f p and 2A p f p f p . The second bracket in the square bracket, is the quantum geometry potential which is negative and higher order in lP but is important in the small volume regime and plays a role in the genericness of bounce deduced from the effective Hamiltonian . This term is absent in effective Hamiltonian deduced from the symmetric constraint. The matter Hamiltonian will typically have the eigenvalues of powers of inverse triad operator which depend on the ambiguity parameters j, l. We already see that the quantum modifications are such that both the matter and the gravitational parts in the effective Hamiltonian, are rendered bounded and effective dynamics must be non singular. For large values of the triad, p p0, B p 6p0 p o p 3 2 while A p 3p0 p o p 3 2 . In this regime, the effective Hamiltonians deduced from both symmetric and non symmetric ordering are the same.

Chunk: around the trap center . By stirring the condensate in this way one or more vortices can be created. This technique was used in the experiment of Ref. , where vortices were generated even at low stirring frequencies. 2.3 Other mechanisms and structures A variety of other schemes for vortex creation have been suggested. One of the most important is that by Williams and Holland , who proposed a combination of rotation and coupling between two hyperfine levels to create a two component condensate, one of which is in a vortex state. The non vortex component can then either be retained or removed with a resonant laser pulse. This scheme was used by the first experiment to obtain vortices in BEC . A related method, using topological phase imprinting, has been used to experimentally generate multiply quantized vortices . Apart from the vortex lines considered so far, vortex rings have also been the subject of interest. Rings are the decay product of dynamically unstable dark solitary waves in 3D geometries . Vortex rings also form 6 N. G. Parker, B. Jackson, A. M. Martin, and C. S. Adams in the quantum reflection of BECs from surface potentials , the unstable motion of BECs through an optical lattice , the dragging of a 3D object through a BEC , and the collapse of ultrasound bubbles in BECs . The controlled generation of vortex rings and multiple bound vortex ring structures have been analyzed theoretically. A finite temperature state of a quasi 2D BEC, characterized by the ther mal activation of vortex antivortex pairs, has been simulated using classical field simulations . This effect is thought to be linked to the Berezinskii Kosterlitz Thouless phase transition of 2D superfluids, recently observed ex perimentally in ultracold gases . Similar simulations in a 3D system have also demonstrated the thermal creation of vortices . 3 Dynamics of vortices The study of vortex dynamics has long been an important topic in both clas sical and quantum hydrodynamics. Helmholtz s theorem for uniform, inviscid fluids, which is also applicable to quantized vortices in superfluids near zero temperature, states that the vortex will follow the motion of the background fluid. So, for example, in a superfluid with uniform flow velocity vs, a single straight vortex line will move with velocity vL, such that it is stationary in the frame of the superfluid. Vortices similarly follow the background flow originating from circulat ing fluid around a vortex core. Hence vortex motion can be induced by the presence of other vortices, or by other parts of the same vortex line when it is curved. Most generally, the superfluid velocity vi due to vortices at a partic ular point r is given by the Biot Savart law , in analogy with the similar equation in electromagnetism, 4 Z s r ds s r 3 where s , t is a curve representing the vortex line with the arc length. Equation suffers from a divergence at , so in calculations of vortex dynamics this must be treated carefully . Equation also assumes that the vortex core size is small compared to the distance between vortices. In particular, it breaks down when vortices cross during collisions, where recon nection events can occur. These reconnections can either be included manually , or by solving the full GPE . The latter method also has the advantage of including sound emission due to vortex motion or reconnections . In a system with multiple vortices, motion of one vortex is induced by the circulating fluid flow around other vortices, and vice versa . This means that, for example, a pair of vortices of equal but opposite charge will move linearly and parallel to each other with a velocity inversely proportional to the distance between them. Two or more vortices of equal charge, meanwhile, Vortices in Bose Einstein Condensates Theory 7 will rotate around each other, giving

Despite the knowledge of these new category of Mueller matrices , not much attention is paid for realizing the corresponding devices. An experimental arrangement involving a parallel combination of deterministic pure Mueller optical devices is proposed in Ref. for realizing type II Mueller devices. The physical situations, where the beam of light is subjected to the influence of a medium such as atmosphere was addressed in Ref. . In the next section, we discuss this ensemble approach for random optical media, proposed by Kim, Mandel and Wolf . 5 3. Mueller matrices as ensemble of Jones devices Kim et. al. associate a set of probabilities to describe the stochastic medium. Then a Jones device Je associated with each element e of the ensemble gives a corresponding coherency matrix C e. The ensemble averaged coherency matrix JeCJ e then describes the effects of the medium on the beam of light. In a similar fashion, the corresponding ensemble of Mueller matrices associated with the ensemble of Jones matrices is constructed and its ensemble averaged Mueller matrix is similarly formed as . Since a linear combination of Mueller matrices with non negative coefficients is also a Mueller matrix, the ensemble averaged Mueller matrix Mav is a Mueller matrix 1. We now turn to the question of constructing an appropriate ensemble designed to describe a given physical situation. The simplest example of an ensemble is one where the elements are chosen entirely randomly, i.e., the system is described by a chaotic ensemble where the probabilities are all equal, , where n denotes the number of elements in the ensemble. The coherency matrix Cav of the light beam passing through such a chaotic assembly is just an arithmetic average of the coherency matrices C e and hence 1 JeCJ e More general models can be constructed depending on the medium for the propagation of the beam of light. For example, one may employ various types of filters or solid state systems through which the light passes the assignment of the Jones matrices and the corresponding probabilities will then differ depending on the weights placed on these elements. Restricting ourselves to an ensemble consisting of only two Jones devices which occur with equal probability , , we have found out that the resultant Mueller matrices can either be deterministic or non deterministic. We give in the foregoing see Table I some examples of Mueller matrices corresponding to different choices of Jones matrices in an ensemble Je, , 2, for some representative cases. This will also serve to show the 1 This is because, each Mueller matrix Me transforms an initial Stokes vector into a final Stokes vector and a linear combination of Stokes vectors with non negative coefficients pe is again a Stokes vector. 6 generality of the ensemble procedure in capturing the physical realizations for the Mueller devices discussed in Ref. .

Chunk: orbital energy lev els are very small. However, when the SOC is taken into account, the spin up and down levels with differ ent orbital quantum numbers are mixed and therefore l and m include the components with the same or bital quantum number. Consequently the matrix ele ments of and become much larger. Therefore, spin relaxation induced by this mech anism depends crucially on the SOC. It is emphasized from the above discussion that the SOC should be included in each spin relaxation mecha nism. In the following calculations it is always included unless otherwise specified. In particular in reference to the mechanism of electron BP interaction, we always con sider it together with the SOC. We further discuss the parallel magnetic field case. In Fig. 1 b the spin relaxation times due to different mech anisms are plotted as function of the quantum well width for same parameters as Fig. 1 a , but with a parallel mag netic field .5 T. It is noted that the spin relaxation rate due to each mechanism becomes much smaller for small a compared with the perpendicular case. Another feature is that the spin relaxation due to each mecha nism decrease in a much slower rate with increasing a. The electron BP mechanism is dominant even at . It is expected to be less effective than the V eI ph mecha 10 nism or V eI ph mechanism or the direct spin phonon cou pling due to phonon induced strain mechanism for large enough a. The g factor fluctuation mechanism is negli gible again. These features can be explained as follows. For parallel magnetic field the contribution of the SOC to Zeeman splitting is much less than in the perpendicular magnetic field geometry.21 Moreover, this contribution is negative which makes Zeeman splitting smaller.21 There fore, the phonon absorption emission efficiency becomes much smaller for small a, i.e., large SOC. When a in creases, the Zeeman splitting increases. However, the spin mixing decreases. The former effect is weak, and only cancels part of the latter, thus the spin relaxation due to each mechanism decrease slowly with a. g factor strain V eI ph V eI ph BP a B T T 1 1 s 1 5 4 3 2 1 0 106 104 102 100 10 2 10 4 10 6 10 8 b B T T 1 1 s 1 5 4 3 2 1 0 101 100 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 FIG. 2 Color online T 1 1 induced by different mechanisms vs. the perpendicular magnetic field B for a b 10 nm. .

Chunk: is referred to as the spin relaxation time for short . The spin dephasing time due to the Dressel haus and or the Rashba SOC together with the electron phonon interaction was studied by Semenov and Kim29 and by Golovach et al..20 The contributions of the hyper fine interaction and the g factor fluctuation were studied in Refs. 30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44 and in Ref. 45 respectively. However, a quantitative calcula tion of electron spin decoherence induced by the direct spin phonon coupling due to phonon induced strain in QDs is still missing. This is one of the issues we are going to present in this paper. In brief, the spin re laxation dephasing due to various mechanisms has been studied previously in many theoretical works. However, almost all of these works only focus individually on one mechanism. Khaetskii and Nazarov discussed the ef fects of different mechanisms on the spin relaxation time. Nevertheless, their results are only qualitative and there is no comparison of the relative importance of the dif 2 ferent mechanisms.13,14,15 Recently, Semenov and Kim discussed various mechanisms contributed to the spin dephasing,46 where they gave a phase diagram to in dicate the most important spin dephasing mechanism in Si QD where the SOC is not important. However, the SOC is very important in GaAs QDs. To fully under stand the microscopic mechanisms of spin relaxation and dephasing, and to achieve control over the spin coherence in QDs,47,48,49 one needs to gain insight into the relative importance of each mechanism to T1 and T2 under vari ous conditions. This is one of the main purposes of this paper. Another issue we are going to address relates to differ ent approaches used in the study of the spin relaxation time. The Fermi Golden rule approach, which is widely used in the literature, can be used in calculation of the re laxation time i f between any initial state i and final state f .12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,21,23,24,25,27,28,50,51,52 How ever, the problem is that when the process of the spin relaxation relates to many states, e.g., when tempera ture is high, the electron can distribute over many states , one should find a proper way to average over the relax ation times i f of the involved processes to give the total spin relaxation time T1 . What makes it difficult in GaAs QDs, is that all the states are impure spin states with different expectation values of spin. In the existing literature, spin relaxation time is given by the average of the relaxation times of processes from the initial state i to the final state f with opposite majority spin of i weighted by the distribution of the initial states fi,18,51,52 i.e., T 1 1 i f . This is a good approximation in the limit of small SOC as each state only carries a small amount of minority spin. However, when the SOC is very strong which hap pens at high levels, it is difficult to find the proper way to perform the average. We will show that Eq. is not adequate any more. Thus, to investigate both T1 and T2 at finite temperature for arbitrary strength of SOC, we develop an equation of motion approach for the many level system via projection operator technique56 in the Born approximation. With the rotating wave ap proximation, we obtain a formal solution to the equation of motion. By assuming a proper initial distribution, we can calculate the evolution of the expectation value of spin. We thus obtain the spin relaxation dephasing time by the 1 e decay of the expectation value of spin operator or to its equilibrium value , with S Sx iSy. With this approach, we are able to study spin relaxation dephasing for various temperature, SOC strength, and magnetic field. For quantum information processing based on electron spin in QDs, the quantum phase coherence is very im portant. Thus, the spin dephasing

Chunk: time when t t decays to 1 e of its initial value to its equilibrium value . 2. Non Markovian kinetics Experiments have already shown that for a large en semble of quantum dots or for an ensemble of many mea surements on the same quantum dot at different times, the spin dephasing time due to hyperfine interaction is quite short, 10 ns.58,59,60,61 This rapid spin dephas ing is caused by the ensemble broadening of the preces sion frequency due to the hyperfine fields.40 When the external magnetic field is much larger than the random Overhauser field, the rotation due to the Overhauser field perpendicular to the magnetic field is blocked. Only the broadening of the Overhauser field parallel to the magnetic field contribute to the spin dephasing. To de scribe this free induction decay for this high magnetic field case, we write the hyperfine interaction into two parts . Here hx, hy, hz and Sx, Sy, Sz are the Overhauser field and the electron spin respectively. 5 1 2 h S h S with h hx ihy. The longitudi nal part HeI1 is responsible for the free induction de cay, while the transversal part HeI2 is responsible for high order irreversible decay. As the rapid free induction decay can be removed by spin echo,60,61 elongating the spin dephasing time to 1 s which is more favorable for quantum computation and quantum information pro cessing, we then discuss only the irreversible decay. We first classify the states of the nuclear spin system with its polarization. Then we reconstruct the states within the same class to make it spatially uniform. These uniformly polarized pure states, n s, are eigen states of hz. They also form a complete orthogonal basis of the nuclear spin system. A formal expression of n is33 n X m1 mN n m1 mN N O I, mj . Here I, mj denotes the eigen state of the z component of the j th nuclear spin Ijz with the eigenvalue mj. N denotes the number of the nuclei. The equation of motion for the case with initial nuclear spin state ns n n is given by33 d e t He Trns HeI ns 1 , e t 1 2 Z t 0 d Trns HeI2, U eI 0 HeI2, e t ns 1 U eI 0 . As in traditional projection operator technique, the dy namics of the nuclear spin subsystem is incorporated self consistently in the last term.33,56 Here Trns is the trace over nuclear spin degrees of freedom. U eI 0 exp i He HI HeI1 . The Overhauser field is given by r Rj , where the constants A and v0 are given later. Ij and Rj are the spin and posi tion of j th nucleus respectively. As mentioned above, the initial state of the nuclear spin bath is chosen to be a state with equal probability of each state, therefore n n , with . To quantify the ir reversible decay, we calculate the time evolution of S n for every case with initial nuclear spin state n . We then sum over n and obtain t X n S n t . It is noted that the summation is performed after the absolute value of S n t. Therefore, the destructive in terference due to the difference in precession frequency zn, which originates from the longitudinal part of the hyperfine interaction HeI1 , is removed. We thus use 1 e decay of the envelope of t to describe the irre versible spin dephasing time T2. Similar description has been used in the irreversible spin dephasing in semicon ductor quantum wells62 and the irreversible inter band optical dephasing in semiconductors.63,64 Expanding Eq. in the basis of , one obtains, d dt e X l3 n l1 l1l3 HeI1 nl1 nl3 e l3l2 e l1l3 l3 l3l2 HeI1 nl3 nl2 o n 1 2

In addition, the sharp peak of C T ex perimentally observed at temperature around 2K cannot be reproduced by both sets of the coupling parameters, which might be a three dimensional long range ordering due to interchain interactions. The fitting results for the magnetization m H of the compound Cu3 CO3 2 OH 2 are shown in Fig. 20 c . We would like to point out that the quantitative fitting by our above parameters to the width of the plateau is not so good, but the quali tative behavior is quite consistent with the experiments both in the transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields, say, H , H , and the saturation field is fixed along both directions, suggesting that our fitting parameters capture the main characteristics.

One might argue that for this diamond chain com pound, from the point of the lattice distance it is unlikely that J1 is AF without XXZ anisotropy while J3 is F with strong XXZ anisotropy. We may offer another possibil ity to support our findings, namely, the case of J1 and J3 with opposite signs is not excluded from the lattice structure of the compound. A linear relationship exists

This observation shows that the ground state of this plateau state might be described by trimerized states. Let Hc1 and Hc2 be the lower and upper critical mag netic field at which the magnetization plateau appears and is destructed, respectively. For Hc1 H Hc2, the magnetization 1 6, namely, the system falls into the magnetization plateau state.

It should be remarked that from the phenomenological Eqs. and , we find that, away from the plateau region, the magnetic field dependence of the magnetiza tion of this model differs from those of Haldane type spin chains where m H H Hc1 1 2. To explore further the magnetic properties of the frus trated spin 1 2 Heisenberg diamond chain in the ground states with the couplings J1 J2 2 2 at dif ferent external fields, let us look at the static structure factor S q which is defined as S q X j eiqj Sz j Sz 0 , where q is the wave vector, and Sz j Sz 0 is the spin corre lation function in the ground state. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, when H equals to zero, the static structure factor has a sharp peak at q , and the peak intensity decreases as increases. It is noted that when H increases, the peak position shifts towards zero wave vector, and then the structure factor S q becomes featureless for a strong field. It can be argued that the above behavior is mainly due to the double Sa states flimsily increasing up to 0.5 in the saturated field, and the decrease of spin correlation when the system is driven into the magnetization plateau state.

Chunk: In our case, there are three values of the variable x corresponding to a value of y in a certain inter val. Consequently, y is better determined by a given x than vice versa, which further yields Dy y. Hence the relative measure of determination indicates that variable x Igor Grabec Extraction of physical laws from joint experimental data 15 10 5 0 5 10 10 5 0 5 10 0 0.02 0.04 X Y PDF , 0.2 random data Fig. 8.

The corresponding joint PDF is shown in Fig. 8, while the properties of the other statistics are demonstrated by Figs. 9, 10 and 11. The properties of the presented statistics could be un derstood, if the overlapping of scattering functions com prising the estimator of the joint PDF is examined. In the previous case with the underlying law yo x , the joint data are distributed along the corresponding line where 8 x 8, while in the last case, they take place in the square region 8 x 8, 8 y 8.

In the last case we can therefore expect the optimal number of samples in the interval around Nro . Since in the last case a larger region is covered by the joint PDF, the overlapping of scattering functions is less probable than previously, and therefore, the joint experimental informa tion Ixy deviates less quickly from the line log N with the increasing N. Therefore, the redundancy increases less quickly and the minimum of the cost function takes place at a much higher number of , which corre sponds well to our estimation. Since in the last case the experimental information Ixy converges less quickly to the limit value than the marginal information Ix, Iy, the mu tual information Im first increases and later decreases to its limit value. Related to this is the approach of rela tive measures of determination Dy x, Dx y to much lower limit values as in the previous case.

Chunk: funda mental one for the description of the phenomenon under examination. This conclusion is consistent with the fact that the centers of the scattering functions are determined by two statistically independent random generators. How ever, the limit values of the statistics Dy x, Dx y are not equal to zero since the region 8 x 8, 8 y 8 where the data appear is limited, while the characteristic region x , y covered by the joint scattering function does not vanish. 4 Conclusions Following the procedures proposed in the previous article , we have shown how the joint PDF of a vector variable x, y can be estimated nonparametrically based upon measured data. For this purpose the inaccuracy of joint measurements was considered by including the scattering function in the estimator. It is essential that the properties of the scattering function need not be a priori specified, but could be determined experimentally based upon cali bration procedure. The joint PDF was then transformed into the conditional PDF that provides for an extraction of the law yo x that relates the measured variables x, y. For this purpose the estimation by the conditional average yo x E y x is proposed. The quality of the prediction by the conditional average is described in terms of the es timation error and the variance of the measured data. It is outstanding that the quality exhibits a convergence to Igor Grabec Extraction of physical laws from joint experimental data 17 some limit value that represents the measure of applicabil ity of the proposed approach. Examination of the quality convergence makes it feasible to estimate an appropriate number of joint data needed for the modeling of the law. It is important that the conditional average makes feasi ble a nonparametric autonomous extraction of underlying law from the measured data. Using the joint PDF estimator we have also defined the experimental information, the redundancy of measure ment and the cost function of experimental exploration. It is characteristic that experimental information converges with an increasing number of joint samples to a certain limit value which characterizes the number of nonoverlap ping scattering distributions in the estimator of the joint PDF. The most essential terms of the cost function are the experimental information and the redundancy. Dur ing cost minimization the experimental information pro vides for a proper adaptation of the joint PDF model to the experimental data, while the redundancy prevents an excessive growth of the number of experiments. By the position of the cost function minimum we introduced the optimal number of the data that is needed to represent the phenomenon under exploration. This number roughly cor responds to the ratio between the magnitude of the charac teristic region where joint data appear and the magnitude of the characteristic region covered by the joint scattering function. It also corresponds to the appropriate number estimated from the quality of prediction by the conditional average. Based upon the experimental information corre sponding to the joint and marginal PDFs, the mutual in formation has been introduced and further utilized in the definition of the relative measure of determination of one variable by another. This statistic provides an argument for considering one variable as a fundamental one for the description of the phenomenon. In this article we graphically present the properties of the proposed statistics by two characteristic examples that represent data related by a certain law and statistically independent random data. The exhibited properties agree well with the expectations given by experimental science. The problems related to the extraction of laws represent ing relations such as y2 . For this purpose the statistical methods are developed in the fields of pattern recognition, system identification and artificial intelligence.

Chunk: of data needed for pre senting related variables. In order to describe quantitatively how well determined the value of the variable y by the value of x is on aver age, we propose a relative measure of determination by the ratio Dy 1 Iy x Iy . If Dy y, the value of the variable x better deter mines the value of y than vice versa. In this case the vari able x could be considered as more fundamental for the description of the phenomenon, and consequently as an independent one. In the case of functional dependence de scribed by a physical law x , the relative measure of determination is Dy , while for the statistically independent variables x and y it is Dy . The entropy of information is generally decreased if the distribution of scattered experimental data at a given x is compressed to the estimated physical law y x . The corresponding information gain is in drastic contrast to the information loss that is caused by the noise in a mea surement system. Igor Grabec Extraction of physical laws from joint experimental data 11 3 Illustration of statistics 3.1 Data with a hidden law The purpose of this section is to demonstrate graphically the basic properties of the statistics introduced above. For this purpose it is most convenient to generate data nu merically since in this case the relation between the vari ables x and y, as well as the properties of the scatter ing function z , can be simply set. For our demonstra tion we arbitrarily selected a third order polynomial law yo x x x 5 x 10 100 and the Gaussian scatter ing function with standard deviation 0.2. To simulate the basic data set , we first calcu lated 50 sample values xi by summing two random terms obtained from a generator with a uniform distribution in the interval 8, 8 and from a Gaussian generator hav ing the mean value 0 and standard deviation 0.2. The corresponding sample values yi were then calculated as a sum of terms obtained from the selected law yo xi and the same random Gaussian generator with a different seed. The generated data were used as centers of scattering function when estimating the joint PDF based on Eq. . An example of such PDF is shown in Fig. 1, while the corresponding joint data of the basic set are shown by points in the top curve of Fig. 2 together with the underlying law yo x . The conditional average predictor, which corresponds to the presented example, was modeled by inserting data from the basic data set into Eq. .

Chunk: data are shown by the middle two curves in Fig. 2. From both data sets the prediction error y yt was calculated that is presented by the bottom curve .. .. in Fig. 2. The curve representing the predicted data o is smoother than the curve representing the original test data .. .. . This prop erty is a consequence of smoothing caused by estimating the conditional mean value from various data included in the modeled CA predictor. In spite of this smoothing, it is obvious that the characteristic properties of the relation between the variables x and y is approximately extracted from the given data by the CA predictor. This further means that the properties of the hidden law x can be approximately described in the region where measured data appear based on a finite number of joint samples. The quality of estimation of the hidden law yo x de pends on the values and number N of statistical samples utilized in Eq. in the modeling of CA and its testing. To demonstrate this property, we repeated the complete pro cedure three times, using various statistical data sets with increasing N and determined the dependence of predic tor quality Q on N. The result is presented in Fig. 3. The quality statistically fluctuates with the increasing N, but the fluctuations are ever less pronounced, so that quality determined from different data sets converges to a com mon limit value at a large N. In our example with 0.2 the limit value is approximately .98. With increas ing N, the curves corresponding to different data sets join approximately at NCA 30.

Dependence of predictor quality Q on number of sam ples N determined by various statistical data sets. tions of Q are ever less expressive. We could conjecture that about 30 data values are needed to model the CA predictor in the presented case approximately. The smaller the scattering width is, the higher gen erally the limit value of the predictor quality is, but on average Q is still less than 1 if 1 and N are finite. This property is in tune with the well known fact that it is impossible to determine exactly the law x from joint data that are measured by an instrument which is subject to output scattering due to inherent stochastic disturbances. The properties of the statistics that are formulated based upon the entropy of information are demonstrated for the case with 0.2 in Fig. 4. It shows the depen dence of experimental information Ixy, mutual informa tion Im, redundancy Rxy, and cost function Cxy on the number of samples N for three different sample sets. In the same figure the maximal possible information, which Igor Grabec Extraction of physical laws from joint experimental data 13 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 N nat log N Ixy Im Rxy Cxy 0.2 Fig. 4.

Similarly as in the one dimensional case , the experimental information Ixy in the two dimensional case also converges with increasing N to a fixed value. In the presented case the limit value is Ixy 3.2, which yields the number K 25. This number is approximately equal to the ratio of standard deviation of variable x and the scattering width and describes how many uniformly

This would not necessarily happen if, instead of changing only the even part of f, we had modified also its odd part.

Then f x, p, fev x, o , fod x, o , and Eq. is replaced by f n o , 2 n n 2n 2 F o hn .

The spurious character of f spur n is suggested also by sum rule arguments see Appendix . The term f spur n o , contributes to all modes of the density strength function the contribution to the mode global paticle number violation , while the other modes give a spurious contribution to the density strength function, increas ing the sum rule and violating the continuity equation local particle number violation . Note that the spurious contribution affects only the even part of the pase space density, not the odd part. 15 6 Spherical Systems The method of action angle variables gives a very compact solution of the lin earized Vlasov equation both in the uncorrelated and correlated cases, however it may be useful to make a connection between the results given by this method and the more explicit treatment of spherical nuclei given in .

These modified coefficients allow us to obtain the modified zero order propa gator D0 L r, r , Z do F o Z d X L dL nN r, r nN i , with dL nN r, r 4 2 2L 1 YLN 2 , 2 2 2 nN T nN nN cos nN r r2vr r cos nN r r 2vr r and the corresponding response and strength functions R0 L Z drdr r2QL r D0 L r, r , r 2QL r , S0 L 1 Im R0 L . For multipole response QL r rL. For normal systems, the zero order propagator D0 L r, r , is given by Eqs. and where nN is replaced by nN and F o is proportional to a function . 18 7 Collective response Up to now, we have been concerned only with the zero order approximation, which corresponds to the single particle approximation of the quantum ap proach. In this approximation, the perturbing part of the hamiltonian is given only by the external field, while a more consistent approach would require taking into account also the mean field fluctuation induced by the external force, so that V ext r, V int r, . In the Hartree approximation, V int r, Z dr v r r r , . where v r r is the long range interaction between constituents. For consistency, we take V int r, Z dr v r r r , , then the collective propagator for correlated systems satisfies the same kind of integral equation as for normal systems DL r, r , D0 L r, r , Z dxx2 Z dyy2 D0 L r, x, vL x, y DL y, r , . Here vL x, y is the partial wave component of the interaction between par ticles. We assume that this interaction can be approximated by a separable form of the kind vL x, y LxLyL , where L is a parameter that determines the strength of the interaction. Then, the integral equation gives an algebraic equation for the collective cor related response function RL Z drr2rL Z dr r 2r L DL r, r , 19 leading to the expression RL R0 L 1 L R0 L . 8 Results Here we compare the multipole strength functions given by our simplified model of pairing correlations with that of the corresponding uncorrelated sys tem. This comparison is made for the quadrupole and octupole strength func tions, since these channels are the ones that are most affected. The static nuclear mean field is approximated with a spherical cavity of radius .2 A 1 3 fm and the A nucleons are treated on the same footing, i. e., we do not distinguish between neutrons and protons. Moreover, we chose . Shell effects are not included in our semiclassical picture and the results shown below should be considered as an indication of the qualitative effects to be expected in heavy nuclei. For the uncorrelated calculations, the Fermi energy is determined by the parametrization chosen for the radius as o F 33.33 MeV, while for the correlated case, the parameter is determined by the condition with the value , the value of is practically coincident with that of o F, so we have used o .33 MeV in the calculations below.

Chunk: density approximation. It is, furthermore, important to realize that the spectral functions themselves are not observable. What can be observed are the decay products of the meson under study. It is thus obvious that even in vacuum the invariant mass distribution of the decaying resonance V X1X2 , reconstructed from the four momenta of the decay 6 U.

Dashed lines reflect error estimates obtained from the spread of the data. Data are from CBELSA TAPS.31 products X1, X2 , involves a product of spectral function and partial decay width into the channel being studied dRV X1X2 dq2 A q2 V X1X2 q2 tot q2 . Since in general the branching ratio also depends on the invariant mass of the decay ing resonance this dependence may distort the observed invariant mass distribution compared with the spectral function itself. This effect is obviously the more impor tant the broader the decaying resonance is and the stronger the widths depend on q2. While these branching ratios are usually well known in vacuum there is con siderable uncertainty about their value in the nuclear medium. This uncertainty is connected with the lack of knowledge about the in medium vertex corrections, i.e. the change of coupling constants with density. Even if we assume that these quan tities stay the same, then at least the total width appearing in the denominator of the branching ratio has to be changed, consistent with the change of the width in the spectral function. This point has only rarely been discussed so far, but it has far reaching consequences. For example, for the meson the partial decay width into the dilepton channel goes like e e 1 M4 , where the first factor on the rhs originates in the photon propagator and the last factor M comes from phase space. On the other hand, the total decay width of the meson in vacuum is given by neglecting the pion masses for simplicity tot M , Hadrons in Medium 7 so that the branching ratio in vacuum goes like e e tot 1 M4 . This strong M dependence distorts the spectral function, in particular, for a broad resonance such as the meson. This effect is contained and clearly seen in theoretical simulations of the total dilepton yield from nuclear reactions see, e. g., Figs. 8 10 in32 it leads to a considerable shift of strength in the dilepton spectrum towards lower masses. For the semileptonic decay channel 0 that has been exploited in the CBELSA TAPS experiment again a strong mass dependence of the branching ratio shows up because just at the resonance the decay channel opens up. In both of these cases the in medium broadening changes the total widths in the denominator of the branching ratios even if the partial decay width stays the same as in vacuum. Such an in medium broadening of the total width, which should be the same as in the spectral function, will tend to weaken the M dependence of the total width and thus the branching ratio as a whole. In medium another complication arises the spectral function no longer depends on the invariant mass alone, but due to a breaking of Lorentz invariance because of the presence of the nuclear medium in addition also on the three momentum of the hadron being probed. Again, this p dependence of the vector meson selfenergy has only rarely been taken into account see, however, refs.20 ,24 ,33 . In addition, final state interactions do affect hadronic decay channels. A quantitatively reliable treatment of these FSI thus has to be integral part of any trustable theory that aims at describing these data. 4.

Escape probability as a function of optical depth for three different geometries uniform sphere solid line , expanding sphere dotted line and plane parallel slab dashed line . 3. The program RADEX is a non LTE radiative transfer code, written originally by J. H. Black, that uses the escape proba bility formulation assuming an isothermal and homo geneous medium without large scale velocity fields. With the current increase of observational possibilities in mind, we have developed a version of this program which is suitable for public use. A guide for using the code in practice is provided in Appendix A and on line7 Appendix B describes the adopted coding style. This section focuses on the implementation of the formalism of 2 in the program. 3.1. Basic capabilities For a homogeneous medium with no global velocity field, the optical depth at line centre can be expressed using Eqs. 2, 7, 9, 11 , as c3 8 3 ul AulNmol 1.064 V xl gu gl xu , where Nmol is the total column density, V the full width at half maximum of the line profile in velocity units, and xi the fractional population of level i. The formal ism is analogous to the LVG method, with the global n dV dR replaced by the local N V, as in microtur bulent codes Leung Liszt 1976 . The program itera tively solves the statistical equilibrium equations start ing from optically thin statistical equilibrium 3.4 for the initial level populations. The program can handle up to seven collision partners simultaneously. In dense molecular clouds, H2 is the main collision partner for most species, but in some cases, separate cross sections may exist for collisions with the ortho and para forms of H2, and electron col lisions may be important for ionic species. In diffuse molecular clouds and PDRs, excitation by atomic H be comes important, particularly for fine structure lines, while for comets H O is the main collision partner We Van der Tak et al. Fast non LTE analysis of interstellar line spectra 5 refer to Flower for the basic theory of molecular collisions, and to Dubernet for an update of the latest results. The output of the program is the background subtracted line intensity in units of the equivalent radiation temper ature in the Rayleigh Jeans limit. The background sub traction follows traditional cm and mm wave spectro scopic observations where the differences between on source and off source measurements are recorded, such that 2 Iem Ibg . The radiation peak temperature TR can be directly com pared to the observed antenna temperature corrected for the optical efficiency of the telescope. However, it should be emphasized that RADEX contains no informa tion about the geometry or length scale and that it is assumed that the source fills the antenna beam. If the source is expected to be smaller than the observational beam, computed line fluxes must be corrected before comparing to observed fluxes. In other types of observations, the continuum may not be subtracted from the data. In sub millimeter and THz observations, for example with ESA s fu ture Herschel space observatory, the dust continuum of many sources will be much stronger than any in strumental error, and baseline subtraction may not be needed. The same is true for interferometer data, where the instrumental passband is well characterized. 3.2. Background radiation field The average Galactic background interstellar radia tion field, ISRF adopted in RADEX consists of several components. The main contribution is the cosmic mi crowave background CMB whose absolute tempera ture is taken to be .725 0.001K based on the full COBE data set as analyzed by Fixsen Mather . This model of

Chunk: the microwave background rep resents the broadband continuum only and does not in clude the strong emission lines, several of which contain significant power in the far infrared and sub millime ter part of the spectrum see, e.g., Fixsen et al. 1999 . The ultraviolet visible near infrared part of the spec trum is based on the model of average Galactic starlight in the solar neighborhood of Mathis et al. . The far infrared and sub millimeter part of the spectrum is based on the single temperature fit to the Galactic ther mal dust emission of Wright et al. . At frequen cies below 10 cm 1 30 GHz , there is a background contribution from non thermal radiation in the Galaxy. A tabulation of this spectrum in ASCII format is avail able on line8, and a graphical representation is shown in Black . One subtle aspect of the calculation is the distinction between the background seen by the observer and the background seen by the molecules. The continuum con tribution to the rate equations may be composed of an external component which arises outside the emitting region and an internal continuum that arises within the emitting region. The CMB and ISRF are examples of external continuum components dust emission from the line emitting region is an example of an internal continuum. While an external continuum always fills the entire sky, an internal continuum may only fill a frac tion of it, for example in the case of a circumstellar disk. With this distinction in mind, the internal intensity be comes Jint B TCBR Iuser 1 B Tex 1 Iuser where Iuser is the continuous spectrum defined by the user. The factor , is the fraction of local continuum which arises outside the line emitting region, and the factor is the fraction of local sky filled by the internal continuum. 3.3. Chemical formation and destruction rates The equations of statistical equilibrium include source and sink terms. By default, RADEX sets the destruction rates equal to the same small value, Di , appropriate for cosmic ray ionization plus cosmic ray induced photodissociation Prasad Tarafdar 1983 Gredel et al. 1989 . The cor responding formation rates are Ei kTform Q Tform where ntotal is the sum of the densities of all collision partners, Tform is a formation temperature default value 300 K , and Q T N X Ei kTform is the partition function. These assumptions imply a nominal fractional abundance of every molecule nmol 10 9 . The value of the nominal abundance is inconsequential because the results in RADEX depend on Nmol V, but not on the fractional abundance. For most molecules currently in the associated database LAMDA and for the most commonly encountered interstellar conditions, these choices will not affect the observable excitation. The formation and destruction rates are computed in a subroutine that can be modified by the user to provide a more realistic description of chemical processes. For example, users may treat the combined ortho para forms of molecules by introducing a realistic Tform, especially in cases where no o p interchange processes is likely to be effective. Other cases of potential interest include the photodissociation of large molecules into smaller molecules, or the evaporation of icy grain mantles into the gas phase. Our formulation in terms of a volume rate of formation is chosen to be independent of the de tails of the formation process. In general, formation and destruction processes are important for molecules that 6 Van der Tak et al. Fast non LTE analysis of interstellar line spectra 3.4.

Chunk: some consistency conditions and the knowledge of the contact value of the radial distribution function of the corresponding single component system. In turn, these contact values lead to equations of state both for additive and non additive hard spheres. Some con sequences of such equations of state, in particular the demixing transition, are briefly analyzed. This is followed in Section 3 by the description of the Ratio nal Function Approximation method to obtain analytical expressions for the structural quantities of three dimensional single component and multicompo nent fluids. The only required inputs in this approach are the contact values of the radial distribution functions and so the connection with the work of the previous section follows naturally. Structural properties of related systems, like sticky hard spheres or square well fluids, that may also be tackled with the same philosophy are also discussed in Section 4. Section 5 provides an account of the reformulation of the perturbation theory of liquids using the results of the Rational Function Approximation method for a single compo nent hard sphere fluid and its illustration in the case of the Lennard Jones fluid. In the final section, we provide some perspectives of the achievements obtained so far and of the challenges that remain ahead. Alternative Approaches to Hard Sphere Liquids 3 2 Contact Values and Equations of State for Mixtures As stated in the Introduction, a nice feature of hard core fluids is that the expressions of all their thermodynamic properties in terms of the radial distri bution functions RDF are particularly simple. In fact, for these systems the internal energy reduces to that of the ideal gas and in the pressure equation it is only the contact values rather than the full RDF which appear explicitly. In this section we present our approach to the derivation of the contact values of hard core fluid mixtures in d dimensions. 2.1 Additive Systems in d Dimensions If ij denotes the distance of separation at contact between the centers of two interacting fluid particles, one of species i and the other of species j, the mixture is said to be additive if ij is just the arithmetic mean of the hard core diameters of each species. Otherwise, the system is non additive. We deal in this subsection and in Subsection 2.2 with additive systems, while non additive hard core mixtures will be treated in Subsection 2.3. Definitions Let us consider an additive mixture of hard spheres HS in d dimensions with an arbitrary number N of components. In fact, our discussion will remain valid for N , i.e., for polydisperse mixtures with a continuous distribution of sizes. The additive hard core of the interaction between a sphere of species i and a sphere of species j is i j , where the diameter of a sphere of species i is i. Let the number density of the mixture be and the mole fraction of species i be i , where i is the number density of species i. From these quantities one can define the packing fraction vd Md, where 4 d 2 1 d 2 is the volume of a d dimensional sphere of unit diameter and 1 xi n i denotes the nth moment of the diameter distribution. In a HS mixture, the knowledge of the contact values gij ij of the RDF gij r , where r is the distance, is important for a number of reasons. For example, the availability of gij ij is sufficient to get the equation of state EOS of the mixture via the virial expression Z 1 2d 1 Md N X i, d ijgij ij , 4 M. L opez de Haro, S. B. Yuste and A.

Chunk: In this study, we present a new approach to solve the problem of the unified description of fluid dynamics based on the concept of the "generalized equipresence" of fluid particles under different conditions. The main idea is to introduce a new variable, called the "degree of generalized equipresence" (DGE), which quantifies the degree of statistical correlation between fluid particles at different spatial positions and at different times. The DGE is defined as the ratio of the probability of a particle being at a given position and time to the probability of a particle being at any position and time. Our approach is based on the Lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), which is a widely used discrete model for fluid dynamics. The LBE is solved by using a novel iterative algorithm, called the "Lattice Boltzmann algorithm with adaptive time-

The exponent for the scale invariance is in a wide range of 0.3, 0.9 , which centered at .66. The distribution of the exponent can be separated into left and right branches with respect to the maximum. The left and right branches are asymmetric and can be fitted exactly with Gaussian form with different widths, respectively. PACS numbers 82.39.Pj, 05.45.Tp I. INTRODUCTION Understanding gene regulation is one of the most excit ing topics in molecular genetics . Promoter sequences are crucial in gene regulation. The analysis of these re gions is the first step towards complex models of regula tory networks. A promoter is a combination of different regions with different functions . Surrounding the tran scription start site is the minimal sequence for initiat ing transcription, called core promoter. It interacts with RNA polymerase II and basal transcription factors. Few hundred base pairs upstream of the core promoter are the gene specific regulatory elements, which are recog nized by transcription factors to determine the efficiency and specificity of promoter activity. Far distant from the transcription start site there are enhancers and dis tal promoter elements which can considerably affect the rate of transcription. Multiple binding sites contribute to the functioning of a promoter, with their position and context of occurrence playing an important role. Large scale studies show that repeats participate in the regula tion of numerous human and mouse genes . Hence, the promoter s biological function is a cooperative process of different regions such as the core promoter, the gene specific regulatory elements, the enhancers silencers, the insulators, the CpG islands and so forth. But how they cooperate with each other is still a problem to be inves tigated carefully. The structures of DNA sequences determine their bio logical functions . Recent years witness an avalanche of finding nontrivial structure characteristics embedded in DNA sequences. Detailed works show that the non coding sequences carry long range correlations . The size distributions of coding sequences and non coding sequences obey Gaussian or exponential and Electronic address yangzhaon eyou.com Electronic address huijieyangn eyou.com Corresponding author power law , respectively. Theoretical model based simulations tell us that the parts of the promoters where the RNA transcription has started are more active than a random portion of the DNA. By means of the nonlinear modeling method it is found that along the putative promoter regions of human sequences there are some segments much more predictable com pared with other segments . All the evidences suggest that the nontrivial structure characteristics of a promoter determine its biological functions. The statistical prop erties of a promoter may shed light on the cooperative process of different regions. Experimental knowledge of the precise 5 ends of cD NAs should facilitate the identification and characteri zation of regulatory sequence elements in proximal pro moters . Using the oligocapping method, Suzuki et al. identify the transcriptional start sites from cDNA libraries enriched in full length cDNA sequences. The identified transcriptional start sites are available at the Database, http dbtss.hgc.jp . . Consequently, Leonardo et al. have used this data set and aligned the full length cDNAs to the human genome, thereby extracting putative promoter regions PPRs .

Chunk: human full length cDNAs, a set of 4737 distinct PPRs are extracted from the human genome. Each PPR consists nucleotides from 2000 to 1000bp, relative to the corresponding transcriptional start site. They have also counted eight letter words within the PPRs, using z scores and other related statistics to evaluate the over and under representations. In this paper, by means of the concept of diffusion entropy DE we try to detect the scale invariant char acteristics in these putative promoter regions. II. DIFFUSION ENTROPY ANALYSIS The diffusion entropy DE method is firstly designed to capture the scale invariance embedded in time series . To keep the description as self contained as 2 possible, we review briefly the procedures. We consider a PPR denoted with y1, y2, , y3001 , where ys is the element at the position s and , T, C or G. Replacing A, T and C, G with 1 and 1, respectively, the original PPR is mapped to a time series x1, x2, , x3001 . There is not a trend in this series, i.e., X is stationary. Connecting the starting and the end of X, we can ob tain a set of delay register vectors, which reads, T1 t x1, x2, , xt T2 t x2, x3, , xt 1 ... T3001 t x3001, x1, , xt 1 Regarding each vector as a trajectory of a particle in duration of t time units, all the vectors can be described as a diffusion process of a system containing 3001 parti cles. The initial state of the system is T1 T2 ... T3001 0 0 ... 0 . Accordingly, at each time step t we can calculate dis placements of all the particles. The probability distribu tion function PDF of the displacements can be approx imated with p m, t Km 3001, where , t 1, , t and Km is the number of the particles whose displacements are m. It can represent the state of the system at time t. As a tenet of complexity theory , complexity is related with the concept of scaling invariance. For the constructed diffusion process, the scaling invariance is defined as, p m, t Km F m t , where is the scaling exponent and can be regarded as a quantitative description of the PPR s complexity. If the elements in the PPR are positioned randomly, the result ing PDF obeys a Gaussian form and 0.5. Complexity of the PPR is expected to generate a departure from this ordinary condition, that is, 0.5. The value of can tell us the pattern characteristics of a PPR. The departure from the ordinary condition can be described with a preferential effect. Let the element is A, T or C, G , the preferential probability for the fol lowing element s being A, T or C, G is Wpre. A positive preferential effect, i.e, .5, leads to the value of larger than 0.5. While a negative preferential effect, i.e, .5, can induce the value of smaller than 0.5. 10 1 10 2 10 3 0 2 4 6 PPR 1 Calculate .662 10 1 10 2 10 3 0 2 4 6 PPR 1000 Calculate .760 10 1 10 2 10 3 0 2 4 6 PPR 2000 Calculate .703 10 1 10 2 10 3 0 2 4 6 PPR 3000 t S t Calculate .500 FIG. 1 Color online Typical DE results. The results for the PPRs numbered 1, 1000, 2000 and 3000 are presented. In considerable wide regions of t , the curves of DE can be fitted almost exactly with the linear relation in Eq. . Hence, a large value of implies that A, T or C, G accu mulate strongly in a scale invariance way, respectively. However, correct evaluation of the scaling exponent is a nontrivial problem. In order to estimate the scaling exponent , a time series of data is divided into multiple overlapping segments and each of them is analyzed separately. By comparing the results of each segment with the average value of the scaling exponent, we can evaluate the statistical significance of this value. We have also compared the scaling exponents between the PPRs and the random sequences, and the results show that the scaling exponents of the PPRs are significantly larger than those of the random sequences. This suggests that the putative promoter regions have more complex patterns than the random sequences. In fact, the complexity can be used as a measure of the preferential effect. The preferential probability is calculated by the following way. First, we define the preferential probability as the ratio of the number of the preferential elements to all elements. Then, the preferential effect is evaluated with the following formula: Preferential effect = (Preferential probability - Average probability) / Average probability. In this paper, the preferential effect is evaluated as 0.266, which implies that there is a preferential effect in the putative promoter regions.

Matrix ele ments do not appear to play a role as the intensity vari ation only depends very slightly on photon energy and polarization. In the 65 K data fig. 2b , the topmost 4p band flattens near and shifts to higher binding en ergy by about 100 meV thin white, dotted line . This shift is accompanied by a larger decrease of the spectral weight near the top of the band. The two other bands fine black lines are only slightly shifted and do not ap pear to participate in the transition. In the M spectrum strong backfolded valence bands can be seen, and the conduction band bends upwards, leading to a maximum intensity located about 0.25 A 1 from M thin white dot ted line . This observation is in agreement with Kidd et al. , although in their case the conduction band was unoccupied in the normal phase. The calculated spectral functions corresponding to the data of fig. 2 are shown in fig. 3, using the free electron fi nal state approximation with a 10 eV inner potential and a 4.6 eV work function see inset . The effect of tempera ture was taken into account via the order parameter and the Fermi function. Only the topmost valence band was considered, as the other two are practically not influenced by the transition see above, fig. 2 . The behavior of this band is extremely well reproduced by the calculation. In the 65 K calculation the valence band is flattened near , and the spectral weight at this point is reduced to 44 , close to the experimental value of 35 . The agreement 4 E EF eV Model ARPES 0.025 0.02 0 FIG. 4 Near EF constant energy cuts in the vicinity of the point. The theoretical data correspond to fig. 3b and the ARPES data are taken from the low temperature data of fig. 2b. is very satisfying, considering that the calculation takes into account only the lowest excitonic state. The exper imental features appear broader than in the calculation, but at finite temperatures one may expect the existence of excitons with non zero momentum, leading to a spread of spectral weight away from the high symmetry points. In the near M spectral function, the backfolded va lence band is strongly present in the 65 K calculation, with comparable spectral weight as at and as the con duction band at M. The conduction band maximum intensity is located away from M as in the experiment. The small perpendicular dispersion of the free electron final state causes an asymmetry of the intensity of the conduction band on each side of M, which is also visible in fig. 2. In our calculation, as opposed to the ARPES spectra, the conduction band is unoccupied and only the occupied tail of the peaks is visible. This difference may be simply due to the final state approximation used in the calculation, a slight shift of the chemical potential due to the transition, or to atomic displacements that would shift the conduction band . Such atomic displacements, in terms of a band Jahn Teller effect, were suggested as a driving force for the transition. However, the key point is that, although the lattice distortion may shift the conduction band, the very small atomic displace ments 0.02 A in 1T TiSe2 are expected to lead to a negligable spectral weight in the backfolded bands . As an example, 1T TaS2, another CDW compound known for very large atomic displacements of or .1 A introduces hardly detectable backfolding of spectral weight in ARPES. Clearly, an

In addition, we introduce a uniform reference PDF x 1 2L indicating that all outcomes of the experiment are hypothetically equally probable before executing the ex periments. Based upon functions fN x and x we describe the indeterminacy of variable x by the negative value of the relative entropy x log fN x x dx. Similarly, we describe the uncertainty Hu of calibration performed on a unit u by x, u log x, u x dx. Igor Grabec Estimation of experimental data redundancy and related statistics 3 Using the difference of these statistics we define the ex perimental information Z Sx f x log fN x dx Z Sx x, u log x, u dx. Using Eq. 2 in this expression we get N 1 N N X x, xi log N X x, xj dx Z Sx x, u log x, u dx. If we express the logarithm in the second term as log N X x, xj log x, xi log 1 N X j i x, xj x, xi we obtain N 1 N N X x, xi log x, xi dx 1 N N X x, xi log 1 N X j i x, xj x, xi dx Z Sx x, u log x, u dx. The second and the fourth term on the right side of this equation yield 0 and we get N 1 N N X x, xi log 1 N X j i x, xj x, xi dx. With the last term we introduce the statistic called redun dancy of data 1 Z Sx x, xi log 1 N X j i x, xj x, xi dx with which we get the basic relation N R If xi xj for all pairs i j, there is no overlapping of functions x, xi , x, xj therefore, the sum in the logarithm is 0, and consequently the redundancy is R 0. In the opposite case, when xi xj , it follows that x, xi x, xj . Due to good overlapping in this case, the corresponding term in the expression of R yields log N and . This property indicates that experimental information is increasing with increasing N as I log N if the ac quired data are well separated with respect to . However, with an increasing number of data, they are ever more densely distributed, which results in an increasing overlap ping of distributions that causes increasing redundancy of measurements. Although the expression in Eq. 10 for re dundancy R is rather cumbersome due to the included integral, we expect that R could be estimated without integration by the simpler function of distances between data points. For this purpose we next consider the prop erties of the scattering function x, xi . If the Gaussian function x, xi g x xi, is con sidered as an approximation of the delta function x xi , and the logarithm as a slowly changing function, the inte gration in Eq. 10 can be carried out, which yields for the redundancy the first order approximate expression with out the integral R1 1 N N X 1 N X j i xi, xj xi, xi .

Chunk: approximation, we have examined the case of just two data points, since it mainly determines the property of the redundancy. In this case the integration of the first three terms in a Taylor series expansion of the logarithm yields the second approx imation R2 1 N N X 1 N X j i exp h xi xj 2 4 2 i , which is obtained from the previous one by merely chang ing 2 2 4 2. This property indicates that a still better approximation could be obtained by properly adapting 2 2 in Eq. 13. For this purpose we have proceeded with numerical investigations which have shown that a nearly optimal approximation is obtained if 2 2 in Eq. 13 is re placed by 5.1 2 Ro 1 N N X 1 N X j i exp h xi xj 2 5.1 2 i . Numerical investigations have further shown that this for mula also yields good results in cases with many data points. Since the integral is excluded from Eq. 15, the redun dancy R can be estimated from Eq. 15 with essentially less computational effort than from Eq. 10. This advantage is especially outstanding in a multivariate case where the redundancy is defined by multiple integrals, while in the approximate formula in Eq. 15 only the term xi xj in the exponential function has to be replaced by the norm of corresponding vectors. Due to this advantage, it is also reasonable to estimate approximately the experimental in formation using the basic formula N R. The experimental information I converges with the increasing number of data N to a certain limit value from which the complexity of the phenomenon under investigation can be estimated using the formula K exp IN introduced previously . The complexity K indicates how many non overlapping scattering distributions are needed in the estimator Eq. 2 to describe the PDF of the observed phe nomenon. The information cost function is the difference of the redundancy and experimental information . During minimization of this cost, the experimental infor mation provides for a proper adaptation of the PDF es timator to the experimental data, while the redundancy prevents excessive growth of the number of data points. By the position of the cost function minimum we introduce the proper number No of the data and the corresponding experiments that are needed to judiciously represent the phenomenon under exploration. By inserting the expres sion N R into , we obtain for the information cost function the formula N . Therefore the proper number No can also be determined from the approximately estimated redundancy Ro. This number roughly corresponds to the ratio between the mag nitude of the characteristic region where experimental data Igor Grabec Estimation of experimental data redundancy and related statistics 5 appear and the magnitude of the characteristic region cov ered by the scattering function . 3 Numerical examples To demonstrate the properties of the approximations R1, R2, Ro let us first consider the case of just two data points separated by a distance x1 x2. Fig. 1 shows the dependence of redundancy R on relative distance x1 x2 as determined by the integral in Eq. 10 and ap proximations in Eqs. 13,14,15. Improvement achieved by subsequent steps of approximation and a fairly good agree ment between approximation Ro and R calculated by the integral is evident. However, in a case with more data points we can generally expect slightly worse agreement due to overlapping of more than two scattering functions in the sum of the approximation formula in Eq. 15. The performance in such a case is demonstrated in the next example. In order to provide for reproduction of the demon strated example, we consider a two dimensional Gaussian random phenomenon with zero mean value. The stan dard deviation of both components is equal to .5, while their covariance is zero. The data generated by

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0164v1 math.GT 2 Apr 2007 On smooth foliations with Morse singularities Lilia Rosati Universit a di Firenze, Dipartimento di Matematica U. Dini , viale Morgagni 67 A, 50134 Firenze e mail rosati math.unifi.it Abstract Let M be a smooth manifold and let F be a codimension one, C foliation on M, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and classification of pairs M, F is a challenging and difficult problem. In this setting, a classical result due to Reeb Reeb states that a manifold admitting a foliation with exactly two center type singularities is a sphere. In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper Ee Kui classify manifolds having a real valued function admitting exactly three non degenerate singular points. In the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an elimination procedure for suitable center saddle and some saddle saddle configurations of consecutive indices . In the second part, we investigate if other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov Compact Leaf the orems, proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At this purpose, in the singular set, Sing F of the foliation F, we consider weakly stable components, that we define as those components admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If Sing F admits only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic to S1, we are able to extend Haefliger s theorem. Finally, the existence of a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov type result. Acknoledgements I am very grateful to prof. Bruno Sc ardua for proposing me such an interesting subject and for his valuable advice. My hearthy good thanks to prof. Graziano Gentili for his suggestions on the writing of this article. 1 Foliations and Morse Foliations Definition 1.1 A codimension k, foliated manifold M, F is a manifold M with a differentiable structure, given by an atlas i I, satisfying the following properties i Ui Bn k Bk in Ui Uj , we have j 1 i x, y fij x, y , gij y , where and are families of, respectively, submersions and diffeomorphisms, defined on natural domains. Given a local chart foliated chart U, , x Bn k and y Bk, the set 1 , y is a plaque and the set 1 x, is a transverse section. The existence of a foliated manifold M, F determines a partition of M into subsets, the leaves, defined by means of an equivalence relation, each endowed of an intrinsic manifold structure. Let x M we denote by Fx or Lx the leaf of F through x. With the intrinsic manifold structure, Fx turns to be an immersed but not embedded, in general submanifold of M. In an equivalent way, a foliated manifold M, F is a manifold M with a collection of couples i I, 1 where i I is an open covering of M, gi Ui Bk is a submersion, i I, and the gi s satisfy the cocycle relations, gj, , for suitable diffeomorphisms gij Bk Bk, defined when Ui Uj .

Chunk: of eF is conjugate to the holonomy of F in the following sense given any leaf L of F such that L M R , then the corresponding leaf eL of eF is such that Hol eL, eF is conjugate to Hol L, F . Example 4.7 Trivial Coupling of Saddles Let , n 3. For , . . . , n 2 we may find a Morse foliation of , invariant for the splitting Sl Sn l 1 Bl 1, where is a diffeomorphism of the boundary. In fact, by theorem 3.4 or 3.5, case iii , Bn l Sl admits a foliation with one center and one saddle of index l. Similarly, Sn l 1 Bl 1 admits a foliation with a saddle of index n l 1, actually a saddle of index l 1, after the attachment. We may eliminate the trivial couple of saddles and we are led to the well known foliation of Sn, with a couple of centers and spherical leaves. 8 Remark 4.8 The elimination of saddles of consecutive indices is actually a generalization of the elimination of couples center saddle, p, q with q Cp F . Indeed, we may eliminate p, q only when the saddle q has index 1 or n 1. This means the singularities of the couple must have consecutive indices and, as q Cp F , there exists an orbit of the transverse vector field having p as limit backward and q as limit forward , or viceversa. Such an orbit is a strong stable connection. 5 Reeb type theorems We shall now describe how to apply our techniques to obtain some generalizations of the Reeb Sphere Theorem for the case of Morse foliations admitting both centers and saddles. A first generalization is based on the following notion Definition 5.1 We say that an isolated singularity, p, of a C , codimension one foliation F on M is a stable singularity, if there exists a neighborhood U of p in M and a C function, f U R, defining the foliation in U, such that f p 0 and f 1 a is compact, for a small. The following characterization of stable singularities can be found in Cam Sc . Lemma 5.2 An isolated singularity p of a function f U Rn R defines a stable singularity for df, if and only if there exists a neighborhood V U of p, such that, x V , we have either x or x , where x respectively x is the limit respectively limit of the orbit of the vector field grad f through the point x. In particular it follows the well known Lemma 5.3 If a function f U Rn R has an isolated local maximum or minimum at p U then p is a stable singularity for df. The converse is also true Lemma 5.4 If p is a stable singularity, defined by the function f, then p is a point of local maximum or minimum for f. Proof. It follows immediately by Lemma 5.2 and by the fact that f is monotonous, strictly increasing, along the orbits of grad f . With this notion, we obtain Lemma 5.5 Let F be a codimension one, singular foliation on a manifold M n. In a neighborhood of a stable singularity, the leaves of F are diffeomorphic to spheres. Proof. Let p Sing F be a stable singularity. By Lemma 5.4, we may suppose p is a minimum otherwise we use f . Using a local chart around p, we may suppose we are on Rn and we may write the Taylor Lagrange expansion around p for an approximation of the function f U R at the second order. We have f p h f p 1 2 , where H is the Hessian of f and 1. It follows 0 in U. Then f is convex and

Chunk: Cp F Figure 13 p q is not a trivial coupling when n 1, where l is the index of the saddle q. ST1 ST2 Figure 14 A singular foliation of S3, with no van ishing cycles. Reeb components, glued together along the boundary by means of a diffeomorphism which sends meridians in parallels and viceversa, give the classical example of the Reeb foliation of S3. If F is a Morse foliation of a 3 manifold, as all saddles have index 1 or 2, we are always in conditions of proposition 4.2 and then we are reduced to consider just two opposite cases i all singularities are centers, ii all singularities are saddles. In case i , by the proof of the Reeb Sphere Theorem 2.4, we know that all leaves are compact in case ii , all leaves may be open and dense, as it is shown by an example of a foliation of S3 with Morse singularities and no compact leaves Ros Rou . As in the previous paragraph, we study the case in which Sing F is regular with stable components, j, j J, where J is a finite set. We have Theorem 7.1 Let F be a C , codimension one foliation on a closed 3 manifold M 3. Suppose Sing F is empty or regular, with stable components. Then we have two possibilities i all leaves of F are compact ii F has a Novikov component. Proof. If Sing F , thesis case ii follows by Novikov theorem. Let Sing F . We may suppose that F is transversely orientable otherwise we pass to the transversely orientable double covering . If Sing F contains an isolated singularity, as we know, we are in case i . Then we suppose Sing F contains no isolated singularity, i.e. Sing F S j J j. Set D F . By the Reeb Local Stability Theorem 2.1, D F is open. We may have D F , and then we are in case i , or D F , and in this case it contains a leaf with unilateral holonomy, F. It is clear that F bounds a Novikov component, and then we are in case ii in fact, from one side, F is accumulated by open leaves. If F is one accumulating leaf, then its universal covering is p R2 F . Suppose, by contraddiction, that the universal covering of F is p S2 F . By the Reeb Global Stability Theorem for manifolds with boundary, all leaves are compact, diffeomorphic to p S2 . This concludes the proof since F must have infinite fundamental group. The last result may be reread in terms of the existence of closed curves, transverse to the foliation. We have Lemma 7.2 Let F be a codimension one, C foliation on a closed 3 manifold M, with singular set, Sing F , regular, with stable components. Then F is a foliation with all leaves compact if and only if there exist no closed transversals. Proof. Sufficiency If the foliation admits an open in M Sing F leaf, L, it is well known that we may find a closed curve, intersecting L, transverse to the foliation. Viceversa necessity , let F be a foliation with all leaves compact. If necessary, we pass to the transversely orientable double covering p f M, eF M, F . In this way, we apply Lemma 5.6 and obtain, as Sing eF , that the projection onto the space of leaves is a global C first integral of eF, f f M R. Suppose, by contraddiction, that there exists a C1 closed transversal to the foliation F, the curve S1 M. The lifting of 2 is a closed curve, S1 f M, transverse to eF. The set f S1 is compact and then has maximum and minimum, m1, m2 R. A contrad diction, because cannot be transverse to

Chunk: f . By the property of gradient vector fields, there exist points t, v such that t v q. Let q q be the negative positive semi orbit through t v . Each of q and q , transverse to the foliation and such that q , is a semi transverse section at the saddle q. In this way, the semi holonomy of a singular leaf Hol S L , F is a representation of the fundamental group 1 S L into the germs of diffeomorphisms of R 0 fixing the origin, Germ R 0, 0 . Now we consider the most interesting case of a selfconnected separatrix S L Cp F , with Cp F satisfying the description of Theorem 3.5, case iii . The singular leaf Cp F , homeomorphic to Sn 1 S0, has the homotopy type of Sn 1 S1. We have Hol Cp F , F e, h , where is the non trivial generator of the homotopy, and h is a map with domain contained in the complement Cp F . The two options h e, h e give an explanation of the two possible results about the topology of the leaves near the selfconnected separatrix. 4 Realization and elimination of pairings of singularities Let us describe one of the key points in our work, i.e. the elimination procedure, which allows us to delete pairs of singularities in certain configurations, and, this way, to lead us back to simple situations as in the Reeb Sphere Theorem . We need the following notion Cam Sc Definition 4.1 Let F be a codimension one foliation with isolated singularities on a manifold M n. By a dead branch of F we mean a region R M diffeomorphic to the product Bn 1 B1, whose boundary, R Bn 1 S0 Sn 2 B1, is the union of two invariant components pieces of leaves of F, not necessarily distinct leaves in F and, respectively, of transverse sections, B1, t Sn 2. Let i, , 2 be two transverse sections. Observe that the holonomy from 1 2 is always trivial, in the sense of the Transverse Uniformity Theorem Cam LN , even if i S L for some singular leaf S L . In this case we refer to the holonomy of the singular leaf, in the sense above. A first result includes known situations. Proposition 4.2 Given a foliated manifold M n, F , with F Morse and transversely orientable, with Sing F p, q, where p is a center and q Cp F is a saddle of index 1 or n 1, there exists a new foliated manifold M, eF , such that i eF and F agree outside a suitable region R of M, which contains the singularities p, q ii eF is nonsingular in a neighborhood of R. Proof. We are in the situations described by Theorem 3.5. If we are in case i , the couple p, q may be eliminated with the technique of the dead branch, as illustrated in Cam Sc . If we are in case ii , we observe that the two leaves Fi, , 2 bound a region, A, homeomorphic to an anulus, Sn 1 . We may now replace the singular foliation F A with the trivial foliation eF A, given by Sn 1 , t . If we are in case iii , we may replace the singular Reeb component with a regular one, in the spirit of Cam Sc . Even in this case, we may think the replacing takes place with the aid of a new sort of dead branch, the dead branch 7 p p q q q r r r s s s s s V Figure 9 On the left the height function on the plane V defines a foliation of the torus on the right a possible description of the foliation.

Considering our formula, we cancel all the summands which include roots that one of their two components is not divisible by 2. Consequently we get 2 V dimV 0, 0 dimV 1, 1 . Recall that an irreducible representation V a, b is self dual if and only if . Since s, s s 1 s 2, , 2 , 2h1 2h2 , 2h1 , 2h2 4s, it follows from Tits theorem that 2 V a, b 0 a b, 1 otherwise.

U M U M U 2M Q1i Qi3 Q3j Qj5 Q5k Qk1 Figure 19 Quiver for the dP2 theory with M fractional branes and flavors. 32 As stated in Section 4, given a gauge theory of D3 branes at a toric singularity, we introduce flavors for some of the gauge factors in a specific way. We pick a term in the superpotential, and we introduce flavors for all the involved gauge factors, and coupling to all the involved bifundamental multiplets. For example, the quiver with flavors for the dP2 theory is shown in Figure 19. On the Riemann surface, this procedure amounts to picking a node and introducing D7 branes crossing all the edges ending on the node, see Figure 18. In this example we obtain the superpotential terms Q1i Qi3Y31 Q3j Qj5X53 Q5k Qk1X15 B.1 In addition we introduce mass terms Qk1 m2Q3j Qi3 m5Q5k Qj5 B.2 This procedure is completely general and applies to all gauge theories for branes at toric singularities7. C Detailed proof of Section 4 Recall that in Section 4 we considered the illustrative example of the gauge theory given by the quiver in Figure 20. Since node 2 is the one we wish to dualize, the only relevant part of the diagram is shown in Figure 21. We show the Seiberg dual in Figure 22.

Chunk: get the following quadratic contributions to the superpotential 00 Q3,1 h 01 Q3,2 h 10Q3,2 h 0M21,1Y12,1 h 0M21,2Y12,2 M 21,1X12,1 M 21,2X12,2 h N k1,1Y13 h1 Q1,1X13 h2 Q2,11X32,1 h2 Q2,21X32,2. The fields massless at tree level are x, x , y, z, 11, , Q3,2 and Q3,2. Three of these are Goldstone bosons as described in the previous section. For real they are Im , Re Q3,2 Q3,2 and Im Q3,2 Q3,2 . We now show that all other classically massless fields get masses at one loop with positive squared masses . As a first step towards finding the one loop correction, notice that the supersym metry breaking mechanism is extremely similar to the one in the ISS model before, in particular it comes only from the following couplings in the superpotential ,2 Q3,2 11 h 2 11 . . . This breaks the spectrum degeneracy in the multiplets Q3,2 and Q3,2 at tree level, so we refer to them as the fields with broken supersymmetry. Let us compute now the correction for the mass of x, for example. For the one loop computation we just need the cubic terms involving one pseudomodulus and at least one of the broken supersymmetry fields, and any quadratic term involving fields present in the previous set of couplings. From the complete expansion one finds the following supersymmetry breaking sector Wsymm. h 11Q3,2 Q3,2 h 01 Q3,2 h 10Q3,2 h 2 11. The only cubic term involving the pseudomodulus x and the broken supersymmetry fields is Q3,2X32,1, and there is a quadratic term involving the field X32,1 Wmass Q2,11X32,1. Assembling the three previous equations, the resulting superpotential corresponds to the asymmetric model in appendix A.2, so we can directly obtain the one loop mass 11 for x m2 2 h 4 2C h2 2 h 2 . Proceeding in a similar way, the one loop masses for 11, x , y and z are m2 2 h 4 2 log 4 1 m2 x 1 16 2 h 4 2C h2 2 h 2 , m2 2 h 4 2C h1 2 h 2 m2 2 h 4 2 log 4 1 . There is just one pseudomodulus left, Re , which is qualitatively different to the others. With similar reasoning, one concludes that it is necessary to study a superpo tential of the form X 1 2 e 1 3 e 2 4 2X . Due to the non linear parametrization, the expansion in shows that there is a term quadratic in which contributes to the one loop mass via a vertex with two bosons and two fermions, the relevant diagram is shown in Figure 16d. The result is a vanishing mass for Im , as expected for a Goldstone boson the one loop tadpole vanishes in this case , and a non vanishing mass for Re m2 Re 1 4 2 h 4 4 log 4 1 . We conclude by mentioning that all squared masses are positive, thus confirming that the proposed point in field space is the one loop minimum. As shown in , this minimum is parametrically long lived against tunneling to the runaway regime. 3.2 Additional examples The dP2 case Let us apply these techniques to consider new examples. In this section we consider a DSB fractional brane in the complex cone over dP2, which provides another quiver theory with runaway behavior . The quiver diagram for dP2 is given in Figure 3, with superpotential Quiver diagram for the dP2 theory. We consider a set of M DSB fractional branes, corresponding to choosing ranks M, 0, M, 0, 2M for the gauge groups in the quiver. The superpotential is given by:

Chunk: on the energetic particle dis tribution in the presence of nonrelativistic shocks is demon strated rigorously in Webb et al. . However a simpler approach is described in Heavens Meisenheimer provided synchrotron losses are not considered important at the injection energies. We will follow this approach here, although we shall introduce a slightly different definition of the cut offmomentum. In the presense of a magnetic field charged particles emit synchrotron radiation with an energy loss rate given 2 Paul Dempsey and Peter Duffy by dp p2 where as is a positive constant. The radiative loss timescale is therefore p . In the steady state, and in the presence of a nonrelativistic flow u, energetic particles obey a transport equation describing advection, diffusion, adiabatic compression and radiative losses, u f z z f z 1 3p u z f p 1 p2 p p4f 0. In the presence of a nonrelativistic shock front where the upstream flow speed is u and that downstream is u the acceleration timescale is u u . At momenta for which tacc tloss the phase space den sity will be a simple power law with f p s where u u . 2.1 Momentum Cut off The spectrum will steepen at momentum p where tacc p tloss p . In the case of momentum independent diffusion this gives u u 1 . In the case of a relativistic shock this result no longer strictly holds since the acceleration timescale defined above is only valid for nonrelativistic flows. Nevertheless, we will use this definition of p throughout the paper for the sake of comparison. However, we require a general definition of the cut off momentum that can be applied in the relativistic limit. An obvious alternative is to define the momentum at which the local spectral index, ln f ln p, becomes s 1 but, as we shall see, it is necessary to perform a Laplace transform of the transport equation to proceed with this problem and it is more straightforward to define the cut offin terms of spectral steepening of the Laplace transformed spectrum. In order to motivate such a definition we solve the nonrel ativistic shock acceleration problem in the presence of syn chrotron losses by first making the substitutions W p4f and y 1 p so that the transport equation, either upstream or downstream of the shock where adiabatic losses are zero, becomes u W z z W z y W 0. Taking the Laplace transform with respect to y W k, z Z 0 W y, z exp yk dy and using the fact that losses prevent any particles achieving infinite energy, i.e. W 0, z 0, the transformed transport equation is u W z z W z ! k . in the case of a momentum independent diffusion coefficient. Since the distribution function must be bounded infinitely far upstream and downstream, the solution becomes W A k exp 1 1 k 2 u z where we have introduced 4 u2 . The isotropic and anisotropic parts of the particle dis tribution function must match up at the shock giving, f p, 0 f p, 0 f z u 3 p f f z u 3 p f p .

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0169v1 hep ph 2 Apr 2007 VERY STRONG AND SLOWLY VARYING MAGNETIC FIELD AS SOURCE OF AXIONS Giorgio CALUCCI Dipartimento di Fisica Teorica dell Universit a di Trieste, Trieste, I 34014 Italy INFN, Sezione di Trieste, Italy Abstract The investigation on the production of particles in slowly varying but extremely intense magnetic field in extended to the case of axions. The motivation is, as for some previously considered cases, the possibility that such kind of magnetic field may exist around very compact astrophysical objects. E mail giorgio ts.infn.it 1 1. Statement of the problem A magnetic field of huge strength can give rise to real particles even if its rate of variation is very small this posibility could be of some interest from a pure theoretical point of view, but it gains more physical relevance if one accepts that such kind of field configurations may be present around some very compact astrophysical objects 1 3 . In this case the time vari ation is related to the evolution of the source, by collapse, rotations or else, and it is therefore very slow, in comparison with the times typical of elementary particle processes. We can call the former time the macro scopic time and the latter the microscopic one. The production of light particles in these processes has been analyzed in some detail in some pre vious papers ,with the suggestion that it is one of the mechanisms at work in the phenomenon of gamma ray bursts the typical microscopic time is related to the electron mass since photons are produced through real or virtual intermediate states of e e pairs. The lightest particles that could be produced are massive neutrinos, but the magnetic moment coupling induced by the standard electroweak interactions is extremely small. There is, at least in the theoretical realm, another very light parti cle, that is the axion owing to its dynamical characteristics it must be coupled also to the electromagnetic field , even more its electomag netic coupling is being actively studied from an experimental side and the possibility of detecting such particles as coming from nonterrestrial sources has already been foreseen . It is immediately seen that the pro duction of axions by a varying magnetic field must be realized through a mechanism different from the previously considered one, in fact the axions are coupled only to the pseudoscalar density E B so the presence of an electric field is necessary as a starting point, but a nonstatic magnetic field creates always an electric field and even though the rate of variation is small, the very large magnetic strength makes the electric field not a tiny one. In the present paper the coupling of the axions field with a given E B density is written in standard second quantized formalism, then the effect of time variation of that density on the axion vacuum is determined and the consequent production is calculated. The result depends both on the spatial shape and on the time variation of the magnetic field in accordance with the prevailing astrophysical hypotheses 1 3 the magnetic field is seen as a bundle of lines of force which may safely be considered straight in comparison with the microscopic scale. The time variation could affect both the shape and the strength of the fields, both are effective in the production process. The calculation procedure is not the standard 2 adiabatic approximation as used in previous investigations , but the feature that one has to deal with a two scale problem is still fully relevant. 2. General form of the production probability The starting point is a second quantized axion field in presence of given, classical, magnetic and electric fields. The axion field x is cou pled to the pseudoscalar density G x E x B x and the coupling constant, of dimension of length, is here indicated by C. We assume that the

Detailed calculations As anticipated in the introduction a more definite model of the mag netic field can by a field of uniform direction at a given time with some transverse shape, both the direction and the shape may vary in time, one possible restriction is the conservation of the total flux. More explicitly these conditions are realized by giving n r r2 1 w r r n w r . The unit vector n gives the instantaneous direction of the magnetic field, r2 and the corresponding derivative, F is the total magnetic flux the parameter defines the size of the field in the transverse directions, w is taken to be cylindrically symmetric and, obviously it must go to zero at infinity, the requirement .

Chunk: with a comparison of Raman experiments on TiOCl and TiOBr in the high temperature phase, showing the consistency with the reported structure. After wards, through the analysis of Raman spectra the crystal symmetry in the low temperature phases will be discussed, and in the final part a comparison with the isostructural VOCl will be helpful to shed some light on the origin of the anomalous high energy scattering reported for TiOCl and TiOBr13,19. 3 A. High Temperature Phase The crystal structure of TiOX in the high temperature HT phase consists of buckled Ti O bilayers separated by layers of X ions. The HT structure is orthorhombic with space group Pmmn. The full representation20 of the vibrational modes in this space group is . Among these, the modes with symmetry B1u, B2u, and B3u are infrared active in the polar izations along the c, b, and a crystallographic axes9, respectively. The modes with symmetry Ag, B2g, and B3g are expected to be Raman active The Ag modes in the polarization aa , bb , and cc the B2g modes in ac and the B3g ones in bc .

Left panel bb polarization right panel aa polarization. perature Raman measurements in different polarizations for TiOCl and TiOBr, and Fig.2 displays the characteristic Raman spectra for the three different phases of TiOBr, the spec tra are taken at 100 a , 30 b and 3K c . At room temperature three Raman active modes are clearly observed in both compounds for the c aa c and c bb c polarizations Fig.1 , while none are observed in the c ab c polarization. These results are in good agreement with the group theoretical analysis. The additional weakly active modes observed at 219 cm 1 for TiOCl and at 217 cm 1 for TiOBr are ascribed to a leak from a different polarization. This is confirmed by the measurements with the optical axis parallel to the ab planes x c x on TiOBr, where an intense mode is observed at the same frequency as shown in the inset of Fig.2 a . In addition to these expected modes, TiOCl displays a broad peak in the c bb c polarization, centered at around 160 cm 1 at 300K a similar feature is observed in TiOBr as a broad background in the low frequency region at 100K. As discussed for TiOCl13, these modes are thought to be due to pre transitional fluctuations. Upon decreasing the tempera ture, this peaked background first softens, resulting in a broad mode at Tc2 see Fig.2 b , and then locks at Tc1 into an intense sharp mode at 94.5 cm 1 for TiOBr Fig.2 c and at 131.5 cm 1 for TiOCl. The frequency of all the vibrational modes observed for TiOCl and TiOBr in their high temperature phase are summarized in Table I. Here, the infrared active modes are taken from the literature7,9 and for the Raman modes the temperatures chosen for the two compounds are 300K for TiOCl and 100K for TiOBr.

Chunk: main features and closely resemble those of TiOBr. Table IV reports the frequencies of the TiOCl modes. The inset shows the TiOBr spectrum in the x c x polarization see text . previous reports13. The calculated values reported in Table I are obtained with a spring model calculation based on phenomenological longitudinal and transversal spring constants see Appendix . The spring constants used were optimized using the TiOBr experimental frequencies except for the ones of the B3g modes due to their uncertain symmetry and kept constant for the other compounds. The frequencies for the other two compounds are obtained by merely changing the appropriate atomic masses and are in good agreement with the experimental values. The relative atomic displacements for each mode of Ag symmetry are shown in Table II. The scaling ratio for the lowest frequency mode mode 1 between the two compounds is in good agreement with the calculation of the atomic displacements. The low frequency mode is mostly related to Br Cl movement and, indeed, the ratio TiOCl .42 is similar to the mass ratio MBr MCl. The other modes 2 and 3 involve mainly Ti or O displacements, and their frequencies scale with a lower ratio, as can be expected. B.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0172v1 cond mat.mes hall 2 Apr 2007 Thermal entanglement of qubit pairs on the Shastry Sutherland lattice S. El Shawish J. Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia A. Ram sak and J. Bon ca Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia and J. Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia Dated 2 April 2007 We show that temperature and magnetic field properties of the entanglement between spins on the two dimensional Shastry Sutherland lattice can be qualitatively described by analytical results for a qubit tetramer. Exact diagonalization of clusters with up to 20 sites reveals that the regime of fully entangled neighboring pairs coincides with the regime of finite spin gap in the spectrum. Additionally, the results for the regime of vanishing spin gap are discussed and related to the Heisenberg limit of the model. PACS numbers 75.10.Jm, 03.65.Yz, 03.67.Mn I. INTRODUCTION In any physical system with subsystems in interaction, indi vidual parts of the system are to some extent entangled, even if they are far apart, as realized already at the beginning of modern quantum mechanics sixty years ago. Today it has be come appreciated that the ability to establish entanglement be tween quantum particles in a controlled manner is a crucial in gredient of any quantum information processing system1. On the other hand, it turned out that the analysis of appropriately quantified entanglement between parts of the system can also be a very useful tool in the study of many body phenomena, as is, e.g., the behavior of correlated systems in the vicinity of crossovers between various regimes or even points of quantum phase transition2. Quantum entanglement of two distinguishable particles in a pure state can be quantified through von Neuman entropy3,4,5. Entanglement between two spin 1 2 particles qubit pair can be considered a physical resource, an essential ingredient of algorithms suitable for quantum computation. For a pair of subsystems A and B, each occupied by a single electron, an appropriate entanglement measure is the entanglement of for mation, which can be quantified from the Wootters formula6. In general, electron qubits have the potential for even richer variety of entanglement measure choices due to both their charge and spin degrees of freedom. When entanglement is quantified in systems of indistinguishable particles, the mea sure must account for the effect of exchange and it must ade quately deal with multiple occupancy states7,8,9,10,11,12. A typ ical example is the analysis of entanglement in lattice fermion models the Hubbard model, e.g. where double occupancy plays an essential role11. In realistic hardware designed for quantum information processing, several criteria for qubits must be fulfilled13 the existence of multiple identifiable qubits, the ability to initial ize and manipulate qubits, small decoherence, and the ability to measure qubits, i.e., to determine the outcome of compu tation. It seems that among several proposals for experimen tal realizations of such quantum information processing sys tems the criteria for scalable qubits can be met in solid state structures consisting of coupled quantum dots14,15. Due to the ability to precisely control the number of electrons in such structures16, the entanglement has become experimentally ac cessible quantity. In particular, recent experiments on semi conductor double quantum dot devices have shown the evi dence of spin entangled states in GaAs based heterostuctures17 and it was shown that vertical lateral double quantum dots may be useful for achieving two electron spin entanglement18. It was also demonstrated recently that in double quantum dot systems coherent qubit manipulation and projective readout is possible19. Qubit pairs to be used for quantum information processing must be to a high degree isolated from their environment, oth erwise small decoherence requirement from the DiVincenzo s checklist can not be fulfilled. The entanglement, e.g., between two antiferromagnetically coupled spins in contact with ther mal bath, is decreased at elevated temperatures and external magnetic fields20. Therefore, it is very important to understand the behavior of entanglement between two localized spins in the presence of temperature and external magnetic field.

Thus we consider an ionic model, based on the charge density of a H ion stabilized by the Ewald field, as simulated by a Watson sphere,35 as in Ref. 31. For such a H ion, 0.525 e out of 2.0 e, i.e. 26 of the charge, is inside a radius of 1.2 a0, so the majority of the charge is outside. Because of the small sphere radius

Chunk: and enhancement factors of Boronski and Nieminen41 as calculated from the full charge density. We obtain a bulk positron lifetime for ZnO of 144 ps, which is at the lower end of the experimental range. Reported experimental values are 151 ps Ref. 42 , 170 ps Ref. 43 , 141 ps 155 ps Ref. 44 , and 182 ps Ref. 45 . Sig nificantly, positrons, which are positively charged, tend to localize in voids and in sites that are favorable for cations, and localize weakly if at all in anion sites, due to the unfavorable Coulomb potential. We do not find positron localization at the O vacancy in our ZnO super cell, indicating that the O is indeed an anion as expected, nor do we find positron localization or a significant life time increase in the cell with a H containing O vacancy. We also find no significant change in lifetime for H in an O vacancy within a charged supercell with one electron removed. In contrast, we obtain a bound positron state for Zn vacancies, both with and without H, reflecting the fact that Zn is on a cation site. The calculated lifetime in a supercell with a Zn vacancy is 212 ps, while with a H filled Zn vacancy we obtain 175 ps in this case H bonds to a single adjacent O to form a hydroxyl like unit with H O bond length of 1.01 A .46 To summarize, we have performed density functional calculations for ZnO supercells with both empty and H filled O vacancies. Based on an analysis of the electronic structure we do not find any evidence for hydrogen mul ticenter bonds, but rather find that H occurs as H . We are grateful for helpful discussions with L.A.

We analyse several relevant questions which have not deserved full attention and pervade the extraction of . Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues.

Chunk: jun tions The urren ts through the mole ular jun tion with losed and op en on gurations in the bias v oltage range 1.0, 1.0V are al ulated b y the Landauer Bu tik er formalism. 34 It should b e p oin ted out that at ea h bias v oltage, the urren t is determined self onsisten tly under the nonequilibrium ondition. The al ulated I V urv es are presen ted in Figure 2. The triangles linking with bla k solid lines are for the diarylethene mole ular jun tion, while the ir les linking with short red dotted lines stand for the jun tion where six F atoms in the p eripheral of y lop en tene are substituted b y H atoms. The lled empt y sym b ols orresp ond to the losed op en stru tures. Our al ulations apture the k ey features of the 5 exp erimen tal results. 23 The urren t through the losed form is remark ably higher than that of the op en one. When the diarylethene mole ule in the jun tion hanges from a losed on guration to the op en one, the mole ular wire is predi ted to swit h from the on lo w resistan e state to the o high resistan e state. The urren t enhan emen t is quan ti ed b y the on o ratio of urren t de ned as R V Iclosed V Iopen V . F or example, the urren t of the losed form at 1.0 V is ab out 4.5 A, whi h is ab out 500 times larger than that of the op en ase. Su h a large on o ratio in this giv en range of bias v oltage an b e readily measured and is desirable for the real appli ation. Note that the predi ted on o ratio at 1.0 V is larger b y ab out one order of magnitude ompared to exp erimen t. 23 W e think one p ossible reason for this dis repan y is the limitation of the omputational metho d. It is w ell kno wn that the al ulated v alue of the urren t through mole ular jun tion using NEGF om bined with DFT is larger ab out 1 2 orders of magnitude than that of these exp erimen tal measured result. 26,31 Other t w o p ossible reasons are en vironmen t e e t and geometry dif feren e.

Chunk: with . Obviously good general agreement between experiment and theory is established, highlighting the high flexibility of the laser protocol. In turn, this understanding can be used to in duce FR bursts at wanted delays TD K , so that at these times further coherent manipulation of all electron spins involved in the burst is facilitated. However, the question arises how accurate condition Eq. for the TD TR ratio must be fulfilled to reach phase synchronization. Formally, one can find for any arbitrary TD TR large K and L values such that Eq. is satisfied with high accuracy. But the above analysis shows, that only the smallest of all available L leads to PSC matching. Experimentally, the facilities to address this point are limited, as the largest TD for which FR signal can be measured are delays around 5 ns between the two pumps. For larger delays the FR bursts shift out of the scanning range. For short TD , on the other hand, the bursts are overlapping with the FR signal from the pump pulses. To answer this question, we have modeled the FR sig nal for commensurate and incommensurate ratios of TD and TR . Figure 2 shows the results together with spec tra of synchronized spin precession modes SSPM at the moment of the first and second pump pulse arrival. The SSPM were calculated similar those induced by a single pulse train . Figure 2 a gives the SSPM for com mensurate . Panel c shows the FR signal created by such a two pulse train. The SSPM for the considered strong excitation are considerably broadened and contain modes for which M 3M TR with integer M , which co incide with each third mode created by a single pulse train. However, the SSPM given by N TR , which do not satisfy the PSC for a two pulse train, are not completely suppressed, because the train synchro nizes the electron spin precession in some frequency range around the PSC. One sees also, that at . This negative alignment decreases the CI mag nitude and therefore the FR signal before the first pulse arrival, and is also responsible for a significantly larger magnitude of the FR signal before the second pulse ar rival see Figs. 1 and 2 c . For incommensurate ratios of TD and TR the SSPM become much more complex. Still we are able to recover the modes which satisfy the PSC at the pulse arrival times. In Fig. 2 b we show the SSPM at TD for , , where the arrows indicate the frequencies which satisfy the PSC for the two pulse train. Only a small number of such modes fall within the average distribution of electron spin precession modes, because the distance between the PSC modes is proportional to 2 K K L TR . The diluted spectra of PSC modes for incommensurability decrease the magnitude of the FR bursts between the pump pulses, in accord with experiment. This shows, that although any ratio of TD TR can be satisfied by large K and L , the FR signal between the pulses should be negligibly small in this case. Consequently, not any ratio of TD TR leads to pronounced FR bursts. To obtain further insight into the tailoring of electron spin coherence, which can be reached by a two pulse train, we have turned from co to counter circularly po larized pumps. The delay between pumps TD was fixed at TR 6 2.2 ns. The time dependencies of the corre sponding FR signals are similar, as shown in Fig. 3. Be sides the two FR bursts directly connected to the pump pulses, one sees a burst 1 due to CI of spin synchro nized modes. The insets in Fig. 3 a show closeups of the different FR bursts. The sign, , of the FR am plitude for the counter circular configuration

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0179v1 quant ph 2 Apr 2007 Experimental nonclassicality of single photon added thermal light states Alessandro Zavatta,1, 2, Valentina Parigi,2,3 and Marco Bellini1, 3, 1Istituto Nazionale di Ottica Applicata CNR , L.go E. Fermi, 6, I 50125, Florence, Italy 2Department of Physics, University of Florence, I 50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Florence, Italy 3LENS, Via Nello Carrara 1, 50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Florence, Italy Dated February 13, 2013 We report the experimental realization and tomographic analysis of novel quantum light states obtained by exciting a classical thermal field by a single photon. Such states, although completely incoherent, possess a tunable degree of quantumness which is here exploited to put to a stringent experimental test some of the criteria proposed for the proof and the measurement of state non classicality. The quantum character of the states is also given in quantum information terms by evaluating the amount of entanglement that they can produce. PACS numbers 42.50.Dv, 03.65.Wj INTRODUCTION The definition and the measurement of the nonclassi cality of a quantum light state is a hot and widely dis cussed topic in the physics community nonclassical light is the starting point for generating even more nonclas sical states or producing the entanglement which is essential to implement quantum information protocols with continuous variables . A quantum state is said to be nonclassical when it cannot be written as a mixture of coherent states. In terms of the Glauber Sudarshan P representation , the P function of a nonclassi cal state is highly singular or not positive, i.e. it cannot be interpreted as a classical probability distribution. In general however, since the P function can be badly be haved, it cannot be connected to any observable quan tity. In recent years, a nonclassicality criterion based on the measurable quadrature distributions obtained from homodyne detection has been proposed by Richter and Vogel . Moreover, a variety of nonclassical states has recently been characterized by means of the negative ness of their Wigner function , this however being just a sufficient and not necessary condition for nonclassicality . It is still an open question which is the universal way to experimentally characterize the nonclassicality of a quantum state. A conceptually simple way to generate a quantum light state with a varying degree of nonclassicality consists in adding a single photon to any completely classical one. This is quite different from photon subtraction which, on the other hand, produces a nonclassical state only when starting from an already nonclassical one . In this Letter we report the generation and the analy sis of single photon added thermal states SPATSs , i.e., completely classical states excited by a single photon, Electronic address azavatta inoa.it Electronic address bellini inoa.it first described by Agarwal and Tara in 1992 . We use the techniques of conditioned parametric amplifica tion recently demonstrated by our group to gen erate such states, and we employ ultrafast pulsed ho modyne detection and quantum tomography to investi gate their character. The peculiar nonclassical behavior of SPATSs has recently triggered an interesting debate and has been described in several theoretical pa pers their experimental generation has already been proposed, although with more complex schemes , but never realized. Thanks to their adjustable degree of quantumness, these states are an ideal benchmark to test the different experimental crite ria of nonclassicality recently proposed, and to investi gate the possibility of multi photon entanglement gener ation. The nonclassicality of SPATSs is here analyzed by reconstructing their negative valued Wigner functions, by using the quadrature based Richter Vogel RV crite rion, and finally comparing these with two other methods based on quantum tomography. In particular, we show that the so called entanglement potential is a sensi tive measurement of nonclassicality, and that it provides quantitative data about the possible use of the states for quantum information applications in terms of the entan glement that they would generate once sent to a

Chunk: 50 50 beam splitter. EXPERIMENTAL The main source of our apparatus is a mode locked Ti Sa laser which emits 1.5 ps pulses with a repetition rate of 82 MHz. The pulse train is frequency doubled to 393 nm by second harmonic generation in a LBO crystal. The spatially cleaned UV beam then serves as a pump for a type I BBO crystal which generates spontaneous para metric down conversion SPDC at the same wavelength of the laser source. Pairs of SPDC photons are emitted in two distinct spatial channels called signal and idler. Along the idler channel the photons are strongly filtered 2 in the spectral and spatial domain by means of etalon cavities and by a single mode fiber which is directly con nected to a single photon counting module further de tails are given in . The signal field is mixed with a strong local oscillator LO, an attenuated portion of the main laser source by means of a 50 beam splitter BS . The BS outputs are detected by two photodiodes connected to a wide bandwidth amplifier which provides the difference homodyne signal between the two pho tocurrents on a pulse to pulse basis . Whenever a single photon is detected in the idler channel, an homo dyne measurement is performed on the correlated spatio temporal mode of the signal channel by storing the corre sponding electrical signal proportional to the quadrature operator value on a digital scope. FIG. 1 color online Experimental setup. HR HT is a high reflectivity transmittivity beam splitter SPCM is a single photon counting module all other symbols are defined in the text. The mode cleaning fiber used to inject the thermal state coming from the rotating ground glass disk RD into the parametric crystal is not shown here for clarity. When no field is injected in the SPDC crystal, con ditioned single photon Fock states are generated from spontaneous emission in the signal channel . We have recently shown that, if the SPDC crystal is injected with a coherent state, stimulated emission comes into play and single photon excitation of such a pure state is obtained . However, a coherent state is still at the border between the quantum and the classical regimes it is therefore extremely interesting to use a truly clas sical state, like the thermal one, as the input, and to observe its degaussification . In order to avoid the technical problems connected to the handling of a true high temperature thermal source, we use pseudo thermal one, obtained by inserting a rotating ground glass disk RD in a portion of the laser beam see Fig.1 . By cou pling a fraction much smaller than the typical speckle size of the randomly scattered light into a single mode fiber, at the output we obtain a clean spatial mode with random amplitude and phase yielding the photon distri bution typical of a thermal source which is then used to inject the parametric amplifier. PROPERTIES OF SPATSS In order to describe the state generated in our exper iment, we give a general treatment of photon addition based on conditioned parametric amplification. By first order perturbation theory, the output of the parametric amplifier when a pure state m is injected along the signal channel is given by m 1 g a s a i g as ai m s 0 i , where g accounts for the coupling and the amplitude of the pump and a, a are the usual noncommuting annihi lation and creation operators. For a generic signal input, the output state of the parametric amplifier can be writ ten as m m where the input mixed state is m m and Pm is the probability for the state m . If we condition the preparation of the signal state to single photon de tection on the idler channel, we obtain the prepared state Tri out 1 i

Chunk: be of the necessary level. For instance, apart from the obvious uncertainties in the isotopic dependence of the spin orbit potential, the GTR does not exhaust 100 of the corresponding sum rules and the shell structure effects such as configurational and isospin splitting of the GTR can have some effect on the calculated GTR energy. It is also noteworthy that, in spite of the claimed self consistency of the calculations, the slope of the calculated isotopic dependence of the IAS energy is about 3 times larger than the experimental one see inset in Fig. 1 of . Note, that the isospin self consistent continuum QRPA calculations of were able to nicely reproduce the slope while overall underestimated the IAS energy by about 0.5 MeV, the well known Nolen Schiffer anomaly . To conclude, we believe that the suggested in method to deduce the neutron skin from the energy spacing between GTR and IAS is rather questionable in its origin and does not fairly provide direct information on the evolution of neutron skin thickness . 4 Some implications of R In several processes of physical interest knowledge of R plays a crucial role and in fact a more accurate value could lead to more stringent tests i The pion polarization operator the s wave optical potential in a heavy nucleus , p, n T T n p has mainly an isovector character T m 0 .

Taking the proton distribution as a reference there is a small so called neutron skin ns correction to the parity non conserving amplitude, Ens pnc, for, say, a 6s1 2 7s1 2 transition, which is related to R as independent of the electronic structure Ens pnc Z 2 R Rp . In 133Cs it amounts to a E E 0.1 0.4 depending on whether the non relativistic or relativistic estimates for R are used . The corresponding uncertainty in the weak charge QW is 0.2 0.8 . iii The pressure in a neutron star matter can be expressed as in terms of symmetry energy and its density dependence P , x 2 E , x 2 E , 1 2 S 1 2x 2 . . . . By using beta equilibrium in a neutron star, n ,x x , and the result for the electron chemical potential, hcx 3 2 x 1 3, one finds the proton fraction at saturation density, 0, to be quite small, x0 0.04. Hence, the pressure at saturation density can be approximated as P 0 s 1 2x0 0S 0 1 2x0 S 0 x0 2 0S 0 . At higher densities the proton fraction increases this increase is more rapid in case of larger p0 . While for the pressure at higher densities contributions from other nuclear quantities like compressibility will play a role in it was argued that that there is a correlation of the neutron star radius and the pressure which does not depend on the EoS at the highest densities.

Chunk: the expected Fe XMLD signal would be within the noise of the measurement of the spectra of Ref. 21, which were taken for a 15 ML FeMn film. Fig. 2 shows a series of magnetic domain images of the Co layer from a sample in which a 0 25 ML wedge of FeMn was deposited on top of a continuous film of 6 ML Co Cu . The left column shows the XMCD contrast at the Co L3 absorption maximum. The right column shows images of the same spot of the sample, acquired with linear polarization of the x rays. As in Fig. 1, the FeMn thickness increases from the top to the bottom of the images. Panels a through g show images obtained for different azimuthal angles of incidence, indicated by an arrow at the right hand side of each panel. Note that the field of view slightly shifted due to readjustment of the sample. The azimuth angle was read from a dial at the sample holder with an accuracy of 1 . 0 corresponds to the nominal direction of the Cu substrate how ever, as will be outlined below, the angular dependence of the magnetic contrast indicates that the real di rection was at 2 azimuth angle. This deviation from the nominal direction is within the accuracy with which the substrate could be oriented upon mounting to the sample holder. The data have been taken in the sequence from a to g . Typical acquisition times were 4 minutes per he licity for the circular polarization, and 20 minutes per polarization direction and photon energy for the linear polarization. Including the necessary sample manipu lations, the time to obtain the data of Fig. 2 totalled 28 hours. The time evolution of the domain pattern is clearly visible in the a g series from the shift of the transition line between paramagnetic and antiferromag netic FeMn towards higher thicknesses. We attribute this to progressing contamination and possibly oxidation by residual gas of the surface of the FeMn layer. The Co layer, however, which is investigated here, is protected against contamination by the FeMn overlayer. The right column of Fig. 2 shows images taken with linear x ray polarization. The upper parts of the im ages clearly reveal identical domain pattern as seen with XMCD. The behavior of the XMLD contrast follows the geometric expectations including the reversal of contrast between panels a and c , and near vanishing of the contrast in panel b for the azimuthal angle of incidence close to 45 with respect to the magnetization. The most prominent observation, and the main result of this work, is the strong suppression of the XMLD contrast visible in the bottom parts of the images which correspond to domains with direction of magnetization. In the following we discuss the angular dependence of XMCD and XMLD contrast in detail. In Fig. 3 we show the Co XMCD contrast as a function of the azimuthal FIG. 2 Magnetic domain images of a FeMn Co bilayer on Cu , acquired at the Co L3 edge with circular polarization left column and linear polarization right column .

The angular dependence of the XMCD contrast of the individual domains confirms very nicely the assignment of magnetization directions in Fig. 2.

In order to prove that we see a genuine magneto crystalline anisotropy we next discuss the role of spin non collinearity and make comparison to other experimental data and theoretical calculations. Besides changing the easy axis direction in the Co layer, magnetic ordering of the FeMn may also induce a small non collinearity of the Co moments. In the case of normal incidence, the effect of the non collinearity is negligible, but for grazing incidence it may contribute to the suppression of the XMLD contrast. 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.00 0.01 0.02 difference 786 784 782 780 778 776 774 772 770 photon energy eV b Dhesi et al., Co Cu vic 4 Kuch et al., Co FeMn Cu 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 rel. absorption a Co L3 FIG. 6 The suppression of the Co L3 XMLD contrast in the regions with antiferromagnetic FeMn layer.

Chunk: which is a measure of the radial reduction or expansion of a material under tensile loading can be defined 1 where R and are the tube radius at the strain o R and before the strain, respectively. 3. Results and Discussion In Figure 1, we present the total energy per atom of the 10,10 SWCNT as a function of strain. Several strain values are applied. The positive values of strain corresponds to elongation and the negative values to compression. We obtained the total energy per atom vs strain curves in the temperature range between 300K 1800K in steps of 300K. Total energy per atom increases as we increase the temperature. An asymmetric pattern is observed in these curves. Repulsive forces are dominant in the case of compression. SWCNT does not have a 5 high strength for compression as much as for elongation. 10,10 SWCNT is stable up to 0.06 strain in compression in the temperature range between 300K 1500K and 0.03 at 1800K. In elongation 10,10 SWCNT is stable up to 0.23 strain at 300K. As we increase the temperature the tube is stable up to 0.15 in elongation until 1800K. At 1800K we can only apply the strain of 0.08 in elongation before bond breakings. Figure 2a shows the variation of the total energy per atom during simulations for the strain values of 0.23 in elongation and 0.06 in compression at 300K. This figure indicates that the tube can sustain its structural stability up to these strain values. Beyond these, bond breakings between the carbon atoms are observed at the strain values of 0.24 in elongation and 0.07 in compression as given in Figure 2b. In Figure 2b. sharp peaks represent the disintegrations of atoms from the tube. Next, bond breaking strains are studied with increasing temperature. In Figure 3, we show the bond breaking strain values with respect to temperature as the temperature increases, disintegration of atoms from their places is possible at lower strain values due to the thermal motion of atoms. But this is not the case for compression as can be seen in Figure 3. Some examples of the variation of the total energy as a function of MD Steps under uniaxial strain values at various temperatures are given in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Figure 4a and Figure 5a shows that the tube can sustain its structural stability for strain values of 0.14 in elongation and 0.06 in compression at 900K 0.08 in elongation and 0.03 in compression at 1800K, respectively. Beyond these points, bond breakings between carbon atoms are observed at the strain values of 0.15 in elongation and 0.07 in compression, at 900 K Figure 4b and 0.09 in elongation and 0.04 in compression, at 1800K Figure 5b . The stress strain curves of the tube are given in Figure 6. at studied temperatures. Our results show that the temperature have a significant influence on the stress strain behaviour of the tubes. The stress strain curves are in the order of increasing temperatures between 300K 900K. Stress value is increasing with increasing temperature . On the other hand between 1200K 1800K the stress value decreases with increasing temperature. This is due to the smaller energy difference under tensile loading with respect to 300K 900K temperature range. This result can also be followed in the total energy changes observed in Figures 2b , 4b and 5b. Table1. gives a summary of the variations of the mechanical properties of 10,10 SWCNT with temperature. As given in Table1, elastic limit has the same value in the 300K 900K temperature range. It drops to 0.09 in the 1200K 1500K temperature range and to 0.08 at 1800K. Young s modulus, Poisson ratio and the tensile strength of the tube have been found to be sensitive to the temperature Table 1. . Our calculated value at 300K for the Young's modulus is 1 TPa which is in a good agreement with the reported values in the literature. The present study shows that the mechanical properties of 10,10 SWCNT are strongly affected by the temperature and the strain values.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0185v2 cond mat.mtrl sci 3 Apr 2007 Potfit effective potentials from ab initio data Peter Brommer and Franz G ahler Institut f ur Theoretische und Angewandte Physik ITAP , Universit at Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 57, 70550 Stuttgart, Germany E mail p.brommer itap.physik.uni stuttgart.de Abstract. We present a program called potfit which generates an effective atomic interaction potential by matching it to a set of reference data computed in first principles calculations. It thus allows to perform large scale atomistic simulations of materials with physically justified potentials. We describe the fundamental principles behind the program, emphasizing its flexibility in adapting to different systems and potential models, while also discussing its limitations. The program has been used successfully in creating effective potentials for a number of complex intermetallic alloys, notably quasicrystals. Modelling Simulation Mater. Sci. Eng. 15 , 295 304 online at http stacks.iop.org ms 15 295 doi 10.1088 0965 0393 15 3 008 PACS numbers 02.60.Pn, 02.70.Ns, 07.05.Tp, 61.44.Br 1. Introduction Classical effective potentials reduce the quantum mechanical interactions of electrons and nuclei in a solid to an effective interaction between atom cores. This greatly reduces the computational effort in molecular dynamics MD simulations. Whereas first principles simulations are limited to a few hundred atoms at most, classical MD calculations with many millions of atoms are routinely performed. Such system sizes are possible, because molecular dynamics with short range interactions scales linearly with the number of atoms. Moreover, it can easily be parallelized using a geometrical domain decomposition scheme , thereby achieving linear scaling also in the number of CPUs. The study of many problems in materials science and nanotechnology indeed requires simulations of systems with millions of atoms. Quite generally, this is the case whenever long range mechanical stresses are involved. Examples of such problems are the study of fracture propagation , nano indentation, or the motion and pinning of dislocations. Other problems may be simulated with more moderate numbers of atoms, but require very long simulated times, of the order of nanoseconds, an example of which is the study of atomic diffusion . In either case, if large systems and or long time scales are required, classical effective potentials are the only way to make molecular dynamics simulations possible. The reliability and predictive power of classical MD simulations depend cruicially on the quality of the effective potentials employed. In the case of elementary solids, such potentials are usually obtained by adjusting a few potential parameters to Potfit effective potentials from ab initio data 2 optimally reproduce a set of reference data, which typically includes a number of experimental values like lattice constants, cohesive energies, or elastic constants, sometimes supplemented with ab initio cohesive energies and stresses . In the case of more complex systems with a large variety of local environments and many potential parameters to be determined, such an approach cannot help, however there is simply not enough reference data available. The force matching method provides a way to construct physically justified potentials even under such circumstances. The idea is to compute forces and energies from first principles for a suitable selection of small reference systems and to adjust the parameters of the potential to optimally reproduce them. For that purpose, we developed a program called potfit . By separating the process of optimization from the form of the potential, potfit allows for maximal flexibility in the choice of potential model and parametrization. The underlying algorithms are described in section 2. Section 3 focuses on the implementation of the algorithms, followed by details on employing potfit in section 4. We discuss advantages and limitations of the force matching method and our implementation in section 5, and present our conclusions in the final section 6. 2. Algorithms As mentioned above, potfit consists of two separate parts. The first one implements a particular parametrized potential model and calculates from a set of potential parameters i the target function that quantifies

Chunk: the deviations of the forces, stresses and energies from the reference values. Wrapped around is a second, potential independent part which implements a least squares minimization module. As this part is completely independent of the potential model and just deals with the list of parameters i, it is fairly straightforward to change the parametrization of the potential tabulated or analytic , or even to switch to a different potential model. 2.1. Optimization From a mathematical point of view, force matching is a basic optimization problem There is a set of parameters i, a set of values bk i depending on them, and a set of reference values b0,k which the bk have to match. This leads to the well known method of least squares, where one tries to minimize the sum of squares of the deviations between the bk and the b0,k. In our case, the reference values can either be the components of the force vector f0,j acting on each individual atom j, or global data A0,k like stresses, energies, or certain external constraints. We found it helpful to measure the relative rather than the absolute deviations from the reference data, except for very small reference values. The least squares target function thus becomes , with 1 X x,y,z Wj fj f0,j 2 f 2 0,j j , and 1 Wk Ak A0,k 2 A2 0,k k , http www.itap.physik.uni stuttgart.de 7Eimd potfit Potfit effective potentials from ab initio data 3 where ZF represents the contributions of the forces, and ZC that of the global data. The small and positive limpose a lower bound on the denominators, thereby avoiding a too accurate fitting of small quantities which are actually not known to such a precision. The Wlare the weights of the different terms. It proves useful for the fitting to give the total stresses and the cohesion energies an increased weight, although in principle they should be reproduced correctly already from the forces. Even if all forces are matched with a small deviation only, those deviations can add up in an unfortunate way when determining stresses, thus leading to potentials giving wrong elastic constants. Including global quantities in the fit with a sufficiently high weight supresses such undesired behaviour of the fitting process. As the evaluation of the highly nonlinear target function is computationally rather expensive, a careful choice of the minimization method has to be made. We chose a combination of a conjugate gradient like deterministic algorithm and a stochastic simulated annealing algorithm . For the deterministic algorithm we take the one described by Powell , which takes advantage of the form of the target function which is a sum of squares . By re using data obtained in previous function calls it arrives at the minimum faster than standard least squares algorithms. It also does not require any knowledge of the gradient of the target function. The algorithm first determines the gradient matrix at the starting point in the high dimensional parameter space by finite differences. The gradient matrix is assumed to be slowly varying around the starting point. A new optimal search direction towards the minimum is determined by the method of conjugate gradients. Then, the target function is minimized along this direction. This operation is called line minimization. When the minimum is found, the direction unit vector replaces one of the basis vectors spanning the parameter space. The gradient matrix is updated only with respect to this new direction, using the finite differences calculated in the line minimization. In this way, no finite differences have to be calculated explicitly except in the very first step. The line minimization is performed by Brent s algorithm in an implementation taken from the GNU Scientific Library . The algorithm is restarted including a calculation of the full gradient matrix when either a step has been too large to maintain the assumption of a constant gradient matrix, the basis

The model includes effects of supersymmetry breaking transmitted by the gravitational interaction from the hidden sector, in which supersymmetry was broken, to the dark energy sector. Then evolutions of the neutrino mass and the equation of state parameter of the dark energy are presented in the model. It is remarked that only the mass of a sterile neutrino is variable in the case of the vanishing mixing between the left handed and a sterile neutrino on cosmological time scale. The finite mixing makes the mass of the left handed neutrino variable. 1. Introduction Cosmological observations have provided the strong evidence that the Universe is flat and its energy density is dominated by the dark energy component whose negative pressure causes the cosmic expansion to accelerate.1 In order to clarify the origin of the dark energy, one has tried to understand the connection of the dark energy with particle physics. In the Mass Varying Neutrinos MaVaNs scenario proposed by Fardon, Nelson and Weiner, relic neutrinos could form a negative pressure fluid and cause the present cosmic acceleration.2 In the model, an unknown scalar field, which is called acceleron , is introduced and neutrinos are assumed to interact through a new scalar force. The acceleron sits at the instantaneous minimum of its potential, and the cosmic expansion only modulates this minimum through changes in the number density of neutrinos. Therefore, the neutrino mass is given by the acceleron, in other words, it depends on the number density of neutrinos and changes with the expansion of the Universe. The equation of state parameter w and the energy density of the dark energy also evolve with the neutrino mass. Those evolutions depend talked at the International Workshop on Neutrino Masses and Mixings, University of Shizuoka, Shizuoka, Japan, December 17 19, 2006 1 February 19, 2013 6 8 WSPC INSTRUCTION FILE shizuoka 2 Ryo Takahashi on the form of a scalar potential and the relation between the acceleron and the neutrino mass strongly. Some examples of the potential have been considered.3 The idea of the variable neutrino mass was considered at first in a model of neutrino dark matter and was discussed for neutrino clouds.4 Interacting dark en ergy scalar with neutrinos was considered in the model of a sterile neutrino.5 The coupling to the left handed neutrino and its implication on the neutrino mass limit from baryogenesis was discussed.6 In the context of the MaVaNs scenario, there have been a lot of works. 7,8,9,10,11,12 In this talk, we present a MaVaNs model including the supersymmetry breaking effect mediated by the gravity. Then we show evolutions of the neutrino mass and the equation of state parameter in the model. 2. MaVaNs Model in Supersymmetric Theory We discuss the Mass Varying Neutrinos scenario in supersymmetric theory and present a model. We assume a chiral superfield A in dark sector. A is assumed to be a singlet under the gauge group of the standard model. It is difficult to construct a viable MaVaNs model without fine tunings in some parameters when one assumes one chiral superfield in dark sector, which couples to only the left handed lepton doublet superfield. 8 Therefore, we assume that the superfield A couples to both the left handed lepton doublet superfield L and the right handed neutrino superfield R. For simplicity, we consider the MaVaNs scenario in one generation of neutrinos.a In the limit that the mass of the superfield A is much larger than the dark energy scale, the effective potential of the real part of A is given by 12

Chunk: of the H i forest is small in the pro jected vicinity of QSO C Fig. 3 , the UV spectral shape is bet ter constrained here than near QSO A and QSO B. From Fig. 4 we note a local R minimum R 1.3 that exactly coincides with the redshift of QSO C .690 . At higher redshifts R rises, possibly indicating a softer ionising field. However, at 2. 2.695 the optical depth ratio is continuously below the median with . Due to the H i over densities near QSO C, all 1, but only the bin at .635 has D 4, so the remaining ones may still indicate low column density ratios . Figure 7 displays the values from FR07 in the redshift range 2. 2.73 in the projected vicinity of QSO C. For comparison, we also indicate 100 that is consistent with the median 102 towards HS 1700 6416 in this red shift range Fechner et al. 2006 . While the data generally shows strong fluctuations around the median over the whole covered redshift range Z04 Fechner et al. 2006 , there is an apparent excess of small values near QSO C indicating a predominantly hard radiation field. From the data, a median 46 is obtained at 2. 2.73 including the lower limits on . The median near QSO C is lower than the median towards HS 1700 6416 by a factor of two and also slightly lower than the obtained for spatially uniform UV backgrounds generated by quasars. The relative agreement of the median near QSO C and hard ver sions of quasar UV background models may result from the soft ening of the quasar radiation by the IGM at the large proper dis tances .75 Mpc considered here Table 3 . This will be G. Worseck et al. The transverse proximity effect in spectral hardness towards HE 2347 4342 9 Fig. 7. Column density ratio vs. redshift z in the vicinity of QSO C. The short dashed line denotes 100 that is consistent with the median 102 obtained in the range 2. 2.75 towards HS 1700 6416 Fechner et al. 2006 . The long dashed line in dicates the median 46 obtained for the shown values 2. 2.73 . further explored in Sect. 6.2. The larger contrast between the median near QSO C and the median towards HS 1700 6416 yields stronger evidence for a local hardening of the UV radia tion near QSO C. However, this comparison value derived from the single additional line of sight tracing this redshift range may be biased itself. Near QSO C the column density ratio still fluctuates and is not homogeneously low as naively expected. We also note an apparent offset of the low region near QSO C towards lower redshift due to fewer absorbers with low at .69. While some of the fluctuations can be explained by uncertainties to recover reliably from the present data, the very low 10 values 24 of the data in Fig. 7 are likely intrinsically low. These values are in conflict with a homogeneous diffuse UV background, and are likely affected by a local hard source. In Sect. 6.4 we will estimate the error budget of by Monte Carlo simulations. If QSO C creates a fluctuation in the spectral shape of the UV background, the distance between the quasar and the line of sight implies a light travel time of . The low high redshift end of the region shown in Fig. 7 corresponds to a light travel time of 64 Myr 44 Myr . Since these light travel times are comparable, we argue that it is important to consider not only the immediate projected vicinity of QSO C to be affected by the proximity effect see also Fig. 10 below . In summary, both spectral shape indicators R and indicate a predominantly hard UV radiation field near all four known quasars

In particular, at any given point in the IGM at Telfer et al. 2002 Scott et al. 2004 contribute to the UV back ground at h 54.4 eV Bolton et al. 2006 . Already low resolution He ii spectra obtained with HST in dicate a fluctuating radiation field, which has been interpreted as the onset of He ii reionisation in Str omgren spheres around hard He ii photoionising sources along or near the line of sight Reimers et al. 1997 Heap et al. 2000 Smette et al. 2002 . Jakobsen et al. found a quasar coinciding with the promi nent He ii void at .05 towards Q 0302 003, thereby pre senting the first clear case of a transverse proximity effect. In Worseck Wisotzki 2003 , the He ii Gunn Peterson trough shows a higher ionisation level towards the quasar than in the IGM outside the proximity zone. This phenomenon can be caused by a difference in the ionising radiation field, a difference in the density of the IGM, or a combination of both.

Chunk: occasionally encountered unphysical values 0. These were replaced by their errors, yielding lower limits on R. We mostly neglected the usually small metal contamination in the computation of in the Ly forest because the errors in R are dominated by the low S N and the more uncertain contin uum level of the He ii spectrum. The FUSE data in the redshift bins at .375, 2.380, 2.730, 2.735, 2.845 and 2.850 are con taminated by galactic H2 absorption, so no R measurement on the full scale of .005 can be performed there. At 2. 2.33 the H i Ly forest is severely con taminated by O vi from the associated system of HE 2347 4342 Fechner et al. 2004 . Furthermore, the Ly forest of both species emerges at zLy 2.294. Because this excess absorp tion would bias the direct estimation of R in the spectra, we tried to decontaminate the forests at .332. was computed from the H i Ly forest reconstructed from the line list by T. S. Kim Sect. 3 . The corresponding was obtained after dividing the FUSE data by the simulated Ly absorption of the lines at higher redshift. Since the decontamination depends on the validity of the He ii line parameters as well as on the com pleteness of the H i line list in the complex region contaminated by O vi, the derived R values at .332 have to be regarded as rough estimates. The resulting R z is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 4. The optical depth ratio strongly fluctuates around its median value R 4.8 obtained for uncontaminated redshift bins, indicating spectral fluctuations in the UV radiation field. We also show in Fig. 4 the median z on the same redshift bins based on the line fitting results in FR07. Also the median strongly fluctuates with a slight trend of an increase with redshift Z04 . Clearly, the data is inconsistent with a spatially uniform UV background, but the median 70 of the line sample is consistent with G. Worseck et al. The transverse proximity effect in spectral hardness towards HE 2347 4342 7 Fig. 4. The fluctuating spectral shape of the UV background towards HE 2347 4342. The up per panel shows the ratio of effective optical depths R vs. redshift z in .005 bins. Data points at .332 crosses have been decontaminated from O vi and Ly absorp tion see text . Foreground quasars are marked with letters and vertical dotted lines as well as HE 2347 4342 star symbol . The green dashed line indicates the median R 4.8 ob tained at .332 in uncontaminated bins. The lower panel shows the median from FR07 in the same redshift bins. The red dashed line in dicates the median 70 of the line sample. quasar dominated models of the UV background. A comparison of R z and z reveals that both quantities are correlated. The Spearman rank order correlation coefficient is .67 with a probability of no correlation 10 15. There is a scatter in the relation between R and , which is due to noise in the He ii data and due to the fact that R is a spec tral softness indicator that is smoothed in redshift. Therefore, in addition to the UV spectral shape, R will depend on the den sity fluctuations of the Ly forest on the adopted scale. In or der to estimate the scatter in R due to these density fluctua tions, we simulated H i and He ii Ly forest spectra. We gen erated 100 H i forests with the same overall redshift evolution of exp eff,H .0032 1 z 3.37 Kim et al. 2002 based on the empir ical line distribution functions in redshift z, column density NH i and Doppler parameter bH i e.g. Kim et al. 2001 .

Chunk: A random walk is a mathematical process in which a particle moves in a random manner. The walker makes one step at each unit time interval. If the walker is at the root or at the end point of a tooth, they leave with probability 1. At any other vertex, the probabilities are parametrized by two numbers o1 and o2. These parameters are shown in Figure 2a and the allowed range of these parameters is shown in Figure 2b. Walks in the teeth have a bias away from or towards the spine depending on whether o2 is positive or negative. Similarly, a walk on the spine is biased away from or towards the root depending on whether o1 is positive or negative. When there is no bias, we say that the walk is critical, and the fully critical case is denoted by o.

Chunk: 0. Then if, as x 0, the first k 1 derivatives of QC x are finite but the kth derivative diverges we define the exponent k by Q k C x x k, and if k is an integer, k when Q k C x x k log x k. In considering the ensemble of combs , we define all these exponents in exactly the same way simply replacing PC x with and so on. Note that for a single recurrent comb but in an ensemble this is no longer necessarily the case applying Jensen s inequality to we see that . If Q k x x k then it is straightforward to show that Rk 1 X k. It follows that if the sequence decays uniformly at large t, which we do not prove, then it falls offas t k 1 k. Thus we define 1 k k . Similarly if Q x log x then R log and, again assuming uniformity, p t falls offas t 1 log t 1. 2.3. Two point functions Let p1 C t n denote the probability that the walker on C, having left r at , is at point n on the spine at time t. The corresponding generating function, which we will call the two point function, is defined by GC x n X 1 x t 2p1 C t n . Letting be a walk on C starting at r and ending at n without returning to r we have GC x n X r n 1 x 1 2 1 Y t . Biased random walks on random combs 7 Following the discussion in section 2.2 of this leads us to the representation GC x n 3 b 1 x n 2 n 1 Y x . 2.4. The Heat kernel Let KC t n, l denote the probability that the walker on C, having left r at , is at point lin tooth Tn at time t. KC t n, l satisfies the diffusion equation on C so we call it the heat kernel. The probability that the walker has travelled a distance n along the spine at time t is given by KC t n X t n, l , and has generating function HC x n X 1 x t 2KC t n . HC x n can be written as HC x n GC x n 1 PC x D Tn x , where Dl x 1 bT 3 l X x k , and we define H x n . Note that, because KC t n is a probability, X x n 1 1 x x . The exponent dk is defined through the moments in n X x n x 1 dk, and in the case dk is defined when X x n x 1 log x dk.

Chunk: D idQ2 by . Moreover, 1 D idQ1 and 2 D idQ2 by . The result follows by transitivity of D. Lemma 2.8 For any m k let i be the residue of m modulo k 1 in the range 2 i k, and let us write k 1 j, for some j 0. Then there exists a prefix code Qi,j of cardinality Qi,j m, such that idQi,j is an essential restriction of id . Hence, idQi, ,1. In Mk,1 and in Inv k,1 we have id D . Proof. For any m k there exist i, j 0 such that 1 i k and k 1 j. We consider the prefix code Qi, 1 ar 1 A aj 1A. It is easy to see that Qi,j is a prefix code, which is maximal see Fig. 1 below. Clearly, Qi,j i k 1 j. Since Qi,j contains aj 1A, we can perform an essential extension of idQi,j by replacing the table entries aj 1a1, aj 1a1 , aj 1a2, aj 1a2 , . . . , aj 1ak, aj 1ak by aj 1, aj 1 . This replaces Qi,j by Qi,j 1. So, idQi,j can be essentially extended to idQi,j 1. By repeating this we find that idQi,j is the same element in Mk,1 and in Inv k,1 as idQi, . By essential restriction, , in Mk,1 and in Inv k,1. And by Lemma 2.7 , id D id the latter, by essential extension, is 1. . . . a1 a1 A . . . ... ar 1 ar 1 A . . . ... aj 1 1 aj 1 1 A . . . aj 1 . . .

The same holds with L replaced by L, R, R, D, J and J. Proof. If for some Mk,1 then let us define by idIm . Then we have idIm , hence Inv k,1 since , Inv k,1 . Moreover, idIm . So far our Lemmas imply that in Mk,1 and in Invk,1, every non zero element is D to one of the k 1 elements id , for , . . . , k 1. Moreover the Lemmas show that if two elements of Mk,1 or of Inv k,1 are given by tables 1 P1 Q1 and 2 P2 Q2, where P1, Q1, P2 and Q2 are finite prefix codes, then we have If Q1 Q2 mod k 1 then 1 D 2. We still need to prove the converse of this. It is sufficient to prove the converse for Invk,1, by Lemma 2.9 and because every element of Mk,1 is D to an element of Inv k,1 namely id . Lemma 2.10 Let , Inv k,1. If D in Invk,1, then mod k 1 . Proof. We first prove that if L then domC domC mod k 1 . By definition, L iff and for some , Inv k,1.

A right ideal morphism is called normal iff domC imC . By Lemma 5.7 of we also have is normal iff 1 imC domC . In other words, is normal iff is entirely determined by the way it maps domC onto imC . For example, every injective right ideal morphism is normal by Lemma 5.1 in . The finite generating set of Mk,1, constructed in Section 3, consist entirely of normal right ideal morphisms. On the other hand, the composition of two normal right ideal morphisms does not always result in a normal morphism, as is shown by the following example domC f and , domC g and 0 so f and g are normal. But domC gf and , so gf is not normal for more details, see Prop. 5.8 in . The next result Theorem 4.5B shows that every element of Mk,1 can be represented by a normal right ideal morphism.

If the answer is no then m . . . 1 n . . . 1 in Mk,1, since they don t have a common maximum essential extension. Otherwise, the computation continues. We compute the finite prefix code A such that m . . . 1 Im n . . . 1 . By Lemma 4.9 Output 1 this can be done in polynomial time, and has polynomial size. Hence, the table of id A can be computed in polynomial time. We restrict m . . . 1 and n . . . 1 in such a way that their images are in A . In other words, we replace them by id A m . . . 1, respectively id A n . . . 1. Since A is essential in Im m . . . 1 and in Im n . . . 1 , we have m . . . 1 in Mk,1, and n . . . 1 in Mk,1.

For every r R we construct a deterministic finite automaton DFA accepting the finite set 1 r A , and a DFA accepting the finite set 1 r A . By Corollary 4.15 this can be done in polynomial time, and the DFAs have polynomial size. The finite sets 1 r and 1 r themselves could have exponential size. Note that domC 1 domC 1 R , and similarly for . Note that usually, domC 1 imC since is not normal in general , and similarly for so we need to use domC , and not just imC . 26 For every r R we check whether the DFA for 1 r and the DFA for 1 r are equivalent. By classical automata theory, equivalence of DFAs can be checked in polynomial time. End of Overview. Automata notation and facts In the following, DFA stands for deterministic finite automaton. The language accepted by a DFA A is denoted by L A . A DFA is a structure S, A, , s0, F where S is the set of states, A is the input alphabet, s0 S is the start state, F S is the set of accept states, and S A S is the next state function in general, is a partial function by function we always mean partial function . We extend the definition of to a function S A S by defining s, w to be the state that the DFA reaches from s after reading w for any w A and s S . See for background on finite automata. A DFA is called acyclic iffits underlying directed graph has no directed cycle. It is easy to prove that a language L A is finite iffL is accepted by an acyclic DFA. Moreover, L is a finite prefix code iffL is accepted by an acyclic DFA that has

Chunk: a single accept state take the prefix tree of the prefix code, with the leaves as accept states, then glue all the leaves together into a single accept state . By the size of a DFA A we mean the number of states, S we denote this by size A . For a finite set P A we denote the length of the longest words in P by l P , and we define the total length of P by P P x P x obviously, P P l P . For a language L A and a partial function A A , we define the inverse image of L under by 1 L . For L A we denote the set of all strict prefixes of the words in L by spref L precisely, spref L . The reason why we use acyclic DFAs to describe finite sets is that a finite set can be exponentially larger than the number of states of a DFA that accepts it e.g., An is accepted by an acyclic DFA with n 1 states. This conciseness plays a crucial role in our polynomial time algorithm for the word problem of Mk,1. Lemma 4.14 Let A be an acyclic DFA with a single accept state. Let be a normal right ideal morphism, with domC and imC . Then 1 L A is accepted by a one accept state acyclic DFA 1 A whose number of states is size 1 A size A domC . The transition table of the DFA 1 A can be constructed deterministically in polynomial time, based on the transition table of A and the table of . Proof. If 1 L A then size 1 A 0, so the result is trivial. Let us assume now that 1 L A . Let S, A, , s0, where sA is the single accept state sA has no out going edges they would be useless . For any set X A and any state s S we denote by s, X . Let and . Since A is acyclic, its state set S can be partitioned into s0, spref Q and s0, QA . Since Q , the block s0, spref Q contains s0, so the block is non empty. The block s0, QA is non empty because of the assumption 1 L A , which implies L A QA . Since L A is a prefix code and is a right ideal morphism, 1 L A is a prefix code. To accept 1 L A we define an acyclic DFA, called 1 A , as follows State set of 1 A spref P s0, QA start state , i.e., the root of the prefix tree of P since P , spref P accept state the accept state sA of A. State transition function 1 of 1 A For every r spref P and a A such that ra spref P 1 r, a ra. For every r spref P and a A such that ra P 1 r, a s0, ra . For every s s0, QA 1 s, a s, a . 27 It follows immediately from this definition that for all p P 1 , p s0, p . The construction of 1 A assumes that maps P onto Q, i.e., it uses the assumption that is normal. As usual, function means partial function, so ., . and 1 ., . need not be defined on every state letter pair. The DFA 1 A can be pictured as being constructed as follows The DFA has two parts. The first part is the prefix tree of P, but with the leaves left out and with edges to leaves left dangling . The second part is the DFA A restricted to the state subset s0, QA . The two parts are glued together by connecting any dangling edge, originally pointing to

Chunk: of 2. Since R is essential in R , 2 1 is an essential restriction of max 2 1. Hence by uniqueness of the maximal essential extension, max max 2 1 max 2 max 1 . Proof of Prop. 1.7 If 2 2 then, by definition, max 2 max 2 , hence by Lemma 1.10 5 max 2 max max 2 max max 2 max 2 , for all RI k. Thus by the definition of , 2 2 , so is a right congruence. Similarly one proves that is a left congruence. Thus, RI k is a monoid. Since every equivalence class contains exactly one element of Mk,1 there is a one to one cor respondence between RI k and Mk,1. Moreover, the map RI k 7 max Mk,1 is a homomorphism, by Lemma 1.10 and by the definition of multiplication in Mk,1. Hence RI k is isomorphic to Mk,1. 1.2 Other Thompson Higman monoids We now introduce a few more families of Thompson Higman monoids, whose definition comes about naturally in analogy with Mk,1. Definition 1.11 The Thompson Higman total function monoid totMk,1 and the Thompson Higman surjective function monoid surMk,1 consist of maximal essential extensions of homomorphisms between finitely generated right ideals of A where the domain, respectively, the image ideal, is an essential right ideal. The Thompson Higman inverse monoid Inv k,1 consists of all maximal essential extensions of iso morphisms between finitely generated not necessarily essential right ideals of A . Every element totMk,1 can be described by a function P Q, called the table of , where P, Q A with P a finite maximal prefix code over A. A similar description applies to surMk,1 but now with Q a finite maximal prefix code. Every Inv k,1 can be described by a bijection P Q where P, Q A are two finite prefix codes not necessarily maximal . It is easy to prove that essential extension and restriction of right ideal homomorphisms, as well as composition of such homomorphisms, preserve injectiveness, totality, and surjectiveness. Thus totMk,1, surMk,1, and Inv k,1 are submonoids of Mk,1. We also consider the intersection totMk,1 surMk,1, i.e., the monoid of all maximal essential extensions of homomorphisms between finitely generated essential right ideals of A we denote this monoid by totsurMk,1. The monoids Mk,1, totMk,1, surMk,1, and totsurMk,1 are regular monoids. A monoid M is regular ifffor every m M there exists x M such that . The monoid Inv k,1 is an inverse monoid. A monoid M is inverse ifffor every m M there exists one and only one x M such that xmx. We consider the submonoids totInv k,1 and surInv k,1 of Inv k,1, described by bijections P Q where P, Q A are two finite prefix codes with P, respectively Q maximal. The unique inverses of elements in totInv k,1 are in surInv k,1, and vice versa, so these submonoids of Invk,1 are not regular monoids. We have totInv k,1 surInv k, ,1 the Thompson Higman group . It is easy to see that for all , Mk,1 contains the symmetric monoids PF kn of all partial functions on kn elements, represented by all elements of Mk,1 with a table P Q where P, Q An. Hence Mk,1 contains all finite monoids. Similarly, totMk,1 contains the symmetric monoids Fkn of all total functions on kn elements. And Invk,1 contains Ikn the finite symmetric inverse monoid of all injective partial functions on An . 1.3 Cuntz algebras and Thompson Higman monoids All the monoids, inverse monoids, and groups, defined above, are submonoids of the multiplicative part of the Cuntz algebra Ok. The Cuntz algebra Ok, introduced by Dixmier for and Cuntz , is a k generated star algebra over the field of complex numbers with identity element 1 and zero 0, given by the 6 following finite presentation. The generators of Ok are the symbols a 1, . . . , an and a ' 1, . . . , an, where n is a fixed positive integer. The relations between these generators are given by:

Schematic view of the zenith angles of the charged muons for diffrent zenith angles of the incident neutrinos, fo cusing on their azimuthal angles. 3.1 Dependence of the spreads of the zenith angle for the emitted leptons on the energies of the emitted leptons for different incident directions with different energies We give the scatter plots between the fractional energies of the emitted muons and their zenith angle for a definite zenith angles of the incident neutrino with different ener gies in Figs. 4 to 6. In Fig. 4, we give the scatter plots for vertically incident neutrino with different energies 0.5 GeV, 1 GeV and 5 GeV . In this case, the relations between the emitted energies of the muon and and their zenith an gles are unique, which comes from the definition of the zenith angle of the emitted lepton. However, the densities frequencies of event number along each curve is differ ent in position to position and depend on the energies of the incident neutrinos. Generally speaking,densities along curves become higher toward cos 1. In this case, cos is never influenced by the azimuthal angel in the scattering by the definition 8. Fig. 5 tells us that the horizontally incident neutrinos give the most widely spread of the zenith angle distribu tion of the emitted lepton influenced by the azimuthal an gle. The more lower incident neutrino energies, the more wider spreads of the emitted leptons. The diagonally in cident neutrinos give the intermediate distribution of the emitted leptons between those of vertically incident neu trinos and horizontally incident neutrinos. 8 The zenith angles of the particles concerned are measured from the vertical direction. 6 E.Konishi et. al., The Reliability on the Direction of Neutrino in SK a b c 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 cos E E muon E 0.5GeV cos 1 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 cos E E muon E 1GeV cos 1 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 cos E E muon E 5GeV cos 1 0 Fig. 4.

In recent work , Jackson and Mallam reversibly unfolded and folded a knotted methyltransferase in vitro, indicating that chaper ones are not a necessary prerequisite. In a subsequent study , the authors provide an extensive kinetic analysis of the folding pathway. In conclusion, we would like to express our hope that this report will inspire more experiments in this small but nevertheless fascinating field. Materials and Methods To determine whether a structure is knotted, we reduce the protein to its backbone, and draw two lines outward starting at the termini in the direction of the connection line between the center of mass of the backbone and the respective ends. These two lines are joined by a big loop, and the structure is classified by the determination of its Alexander polynomial . To determine the size of the knotted core, we delete successively amino acids from the N terminus until the protein becomes unknotted . The proce dure is repeated at the C terminus starting with the last structure that contained the original knot. For each deletion, the outward pointing line through the new termini is parallel to the respective lines computed for the full structure. The thus determined size should, however, only be regarded as a guideline. A better estimate can be achieved by looking at the structure. In Table 1 we include knotted structures with no missing amino acids in the center of the protein. A list of potentially knotted structures with missing amino acids can be found in Table S3. Technically, the numbering of the residues in the mmcif file has to be subsequent, and no two amino acids are allowed to be more than 6 A apart. In addition, the knot has to persist when two amino acids are cut from either terminus. We have further excluded structures for which unknotted counterexamples exist e.g., only one nuclear magnetic resonance structure among many is knotted or another structure of the same protein is unknotted . If a structure is fragmented, the knot has to appear in one fragment and in the resulting structure obtained from connecting missing sections by straight lines. Other knotted structures are only considered when at least one additional member of the same structural family contains a knot according to the criteria above. The enforcement of these rules leads to the exclusion of the bluetongue virus core protein and photoreceptor phyto chrome A in D. radiodurans , which have been previously identified as being knotted. Both structures are fragmented and become knotted only when a few missing fragments are connected by straight lines. In the viral core protein, the dangling C terminus threads through a loose loop and becomes knotted in one out of two cases. On the other hand, the photoreceptor phytochrome A appears to contain a true knot. Notably, our analysis suggests that the thus connected structure of phytochrome A contains a figure eight knot instead of a trefoil as reported in . Moreover, we excluded a structure of the Autographa California nuclear polyhedrosis virus, which contains a knot according to our criteria. However, the N terminus is buried inside the protein and the knot only exists because of our specific connection to the outside. To further validate our criteria, we implemented an alternative method that relies on the statistical analysis of multiple random closures. We arbitrarily chose two points on a sphere which has to be larger than the protein and connected each with one terminus. The two points can be joined unambiguously, and the resulting loop was analyzed by calculating the Alexander polynomial. We repeated the procedure 1,000 times, and defined the knot as the majority type. Applying this analysis, we discovered 241 knotted structures in

Chunk: t2 2 Szn t1, t2 2, where Szn t1, t2 2 R t2 t1 Sz n t 2 dt t2 t1 . In order to show the physical meaning of n, we write Sz n t as Sz n t Cn n t , where Cn is a constant and n t is a time dependent term. Then Eq. becomes n R t2 t1 2 n t dt t2 t1 R t2 t1 n t dt t2 t1 2 1 2 . It is clear that if Sz n t is a constant in the time interval t1, t2 , then n 0. In general, since the initial state is not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian Eq. , the magnetization of each spin will fluctuate and n t 0. If, after long time, the system relaxes to a stationary state that contains a DW, the magnetization of each spin will fluctuate around its stationary value Cn. The fluctuations are given by n t . If n t is large, the difference between the actual magnetization profile at time t and the stationary profile Cn may be large. From Eq. , it is clear that n is a measure of the deviation of Sz n t from its stationary value Cn, averaged over the time interval t1, t2 . Thus, n gives direct information about the dynamics stability of the DW. Figure 10 shows the distribution n for different values of .

The black dots are the simulation data and the solid line in each panel is given by Eq. . 3. As expected, the distribution of n is symmetric about the centre of the spin chain .5 . We first consider how n changes with for fixed n. From Fig.10, we conclude 1 For the spins which are not located at the DW cen tre, i.e., n 10, 11, n decreases if becomes larger. This means that the quantum fluctuations of these spins become smaller if we increase the value of . This is reasonable because with increasing , the initial state approaches an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian for which n 0 Ising limit . 2 For the spins at the DW centre, i.e., , 11, when becomes larger and larger, n first increases and then decreases. Qualitatively, this can be understood in the following way. When is close to 1, the magneti zation at the DW centre disappears very fast and remains zero. However, if 1, the magnetization at the DW centre will retain its initial direction, hence the behavior of the spin at the DW centre will qualitatively change as moves away from the critical . In Fig. 11, we plot 10 11 as a function of . It is clear that 10 first increases as increases, reaches its maximum .3, and then decreases as be comes larger. Now we consider the n dependence of n for fixed . Since n is a symmetric function of n, we may consider only one side of the whole chain, e.g., the spins with , 2, ..., N 2. From Fig.10, according to the value of , there are three different regions 1 1.05 1.3 starting from the boundary , n first decreases, then increases, and finally decreases again as n approaches the DW centre . As we discussed already, the fluctuation of the magneti zation at the DW centre is small when is close to 1. The spin at the boundary only interacts with one nearest spin, so it has more freedom

Chunk: to fluctuate. For the others, because of the influence of the DW structure or bound ary , the fluctuations of the spins which are near the DW or near the boundary are larger compared to those of a spin located in the middle of a polarized region.

It follows from Eqs. that similarly to the previous example, the qubit s density matrix is no longer a mixture . The relaxation takes place together with decoherence in this case too. Let us consider weak distortion of the qubit by the SET, 0. Although the values of U are restricted from below U L E0 , this limit can be achieved if the level E0 is close to the Fermi energy, providing only that L E0 , and U. Now we evaluate 11 t with the rate equations and then compare it with the same quantity obtained from the Bloch equations, Eq. , where d,r are given by Eqs. and . The corresponding charge correlator, SQ R , is evaluated by Eqs. B6 and . As an example, we take symmetric qubit with aligned levels, o 0, .05 0 and .5 0.

Indeed, in this case 11 t obtained Eq. with d given by Eq. and , agrees very well with that obtained from the rate equations , as shown in Fig. 9b. Such an example clearly illustrates that the decoher ence is not related to the fluctuation spectrum of the environment, whenever the environment is strongly af fected by the qubit, even if the coupling with a qubit is small.

SUMMARY In this paper we propose a simple model describing a qubit interacting with fluctuating environment. The latter is represented by a single electron transistor SET in close proximity of the qubit. Then the fluctuations of the charge inside the SET generate fluctuating field acting on the qubit. In the limit of large bias voltage, the Schr odinger equation for the entire system is reduced to the Bloch type rate equations. The resulting equations are very simple, so that one can easily analyze the limits of weak and strong coupling of the qubit with the SET.

Chunk: the latter represents a pure environment and b the SET behavior depends on the qubit s state. In the latter case the SET can measure the qubit. The setup corresponding to the pure environment is realized when the energy level of the SET carrying the current lies deeply inside the potential bias. The second measure ment regime of the SET is realized when the tunnel ing widths of the SET are energy dependent, or when the energy level of the SET carrying the current is close enough to the Fermi level of the corresponding reservoir. Then the electron electron interaction between the qubit and the SET modulates the electron current through the SET. In the case of the pure environment no measurement regime we investigate separately two dif ferent configurations of the qubit with respect to the SET. In the first one the SET produces fluctuations of the off diagonal coupling Rabi frequency between two qubit s states. In the second configuration the SET pro duces fluctuations of the qubit s energy levels. In the both cases we find no relaxation of the qubit, despite the energy transfer between the qubit and the SET can take place. As a result the qubit always turns asymptot ically to the statistical mixture. We also found that in both cases the decoherence rate of the qubit in the weak coupling limit is given by the spectral density of the cor responding fluctuating parameter. The difference is that in the case of the off diagonal coupling fluctuations the spectral density is taken at zero frequency, whereas in the case of the energy level fluctuations it is taken at the Rabi frequency. In the case of the strong coupling limit, however, the decoherence rate is not related to the fluctuation spec trum. Moreover we found that the electron in the qubit is localized in this limit due to an effective decrease of the off diagonal coupling. This phenomenon may resem ble the localization in the spin boson model in the strong coupling limit. If the charge correlator and the total SET current are affected by the qubit back action effect , we found that the off diagonal density matrix elements of the qubit sur vive in the steady state limit and therefore the relax ation rate is not zero. We concentrated on the case of weak coupling, when the Coulomb repulsion between the qubit and the SET is smaller then the Rabi frequency. The back action of the qubit on the SET, however, can be weak or strong. In the first case we found that the total damping rate of the qubit due to decoherence and relaxation is again given by the spectral density of the SET charge fluctuations, modulated by the qubit. This relation, however, is not working if the back action is strong. Indeed, we found that the damping rate of the qubit in this case is larger by an order of magnitude than that given by the spectral density of the corresponding fluctuating parameter. This looks like that in the strong back action of the qubit on the SET the major component of decoherence is not coming from the fluctuation spectrum of the qubit s parameters only, but also from the measurement sig nal of the SET. On the first sight it could agree with an analysis of Ref.30, suggesting that the decoherence rate contains two components, generated by a measure ment and by a pure environment environmental fluc tuations . The latter therefore represents an unavoid able decoherence, generated by any environment. Yet, in a weak coupling regime such a separation seems not working. In this case the damping decoherence rate is totally determined by the environment fluctuations, even so modulated by the qubit. Although our model deals with a particular setup, it bears the main physics of a fluctuating environment, act ing on a qubit. Indeed, the Bloch type rate

Chunk: from the Schr odinger equation i t t Hqb t we adopt the units where 1 and the electron charge . The corresponding density matrix, jj t b j t b j t , with j, j , is obtained from the equation i t H, . This can be written explicitly as 0 21 12 3a 12 i 0 1 2 11 , 3b where 22 t 1 11 t , 21 t 12 t and o E1 E2. Solving these equations one easily finds that the electron oscillates between the two dots Rabi oscil lations with frequency 2 0 o 2. For instance, for the initial conditions , the probability of finding the electron in the second dot is 22 t 2 0 R 2 1 cos Rt . This result shows that for o 0 the amplitude of the Rabi oscillations is small, so the electron remains localized in its initial state. The situation is different when the qubit interacts with the environment. In this case the reduced density ma trix of the qubit t is obtained by tracing out the en vironment variables from the total density matrix. The question is how to modify Eqs. , written for an isolated qubit, in order to obtain the reduced density matrix of the qubit, t . In general one expects that the environ ment could affect the qubit in two different ways. First, it can destroy the off diagonal elements of the qubit density matrix. This process is usually referred to as decoherence or dephasing . It can be accounted for phenomenolog ically by introducing an additional damping term in Eq. 3b , 12 i 0 1 2 11 d 2 12 where d is the decoherence rate. As a result the qubit density matrix t becomes a statistical mixture in the stationary limit, t t 1 2 0 0 1 2 . This happens for any initial conditions and even for large level displacement, o 0, d provided that 0 0 . Note that the statistical mixture is proportional to the unity matrix and therefore it remains the same in any basis. Secondly, the environment can put the qubit in its ground state, for instance via photon or phonon emis sion. This process is usually referred to as relaxation. For a symmetric qubit we would have t t 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 . In contrast with decoherence, Eq. , the relaxation pro cess puts the qubit into a pure state. That implies that the corresponding density matrix can be always written as 1i 1j in a certain basis the basis of the qubit eigen states . This is in fact the essential difference between decoherence and relaxation. With respect to elimination of the off diagonal density matrix elements, note that re laxation would eliminate these terms only in the qubit s eigenstates basis. In contrast, decoherence eliminates the off diagonal density matrix element in any basis Eq. . In fact, if the environment has some energy, it can put the qubit into an exited state. However, if the qubit is finally in a pure state, such excitation process generated by the environment affects the qubit in the same way as 4 relaxation it eliminates the off diagonal density matrix elements only in a certain qubit s basis. Therefore exci tation of the qubit can be described phenomenologically on the same footing as relaxation. It is often claimed that decoherence is associated with an absence of energy transfer between the system and the environment, in contrast with relaxation excitation . This distinction is not generally valid. For instance, if the initial qubit state corresponds to the electron in the state E2 , Fig. 1, the final state after decoherence corresponds to an equal distribution between the two dots, E1 E2 2. In the case of E1 E2, this process would require a large energy

Therefore decoherence can be consistently defines as a process leading to a statistical mixture, where all states of the system have equal probabilities as in Eq. . The relaxation excitation process can be described most simply by diagonalizing the qubit Hamiltonian, Eqs. , to obtain a E a a , where the operators a are obtained by the corresponding ro tation of the operators a1,230. Here E and E are the ground symmetric and excited antisymmetric state energies. Then the relaxation process can be described phenomenologically in the new qubit basis a 0 as t r t 7a t i E E t r 2 t , 7b where t 1 t , t t and r is the relaxation rate. In order to add decoherence, we return to the orig inal qubit basis 1, 2 a 1,2 0 and add the damping term to the equation for the off diagonal matrix elements, Eq. . We arrive at the quantum rate equation describ ing the qubit s behavior in the presence of both decoher ence and relaxation30,33, 0 21 12 r o 2 o 12 21 r 4 1 o o 2 2 11 1 r o 2 o 8a 12 h i 0 r o 2 o i 1 2 11 r 1 2 12 2 12 21 d 2 12 , 8b where o o 2 4 2 0 1 2 and 0 o . In fact, these equations can be derived in the framework of a particu lar model, representing an electrostatic qubit interacting with the point contact detector and the environment, de scribed by the Lee model Hamiltonian33. Equations can be rewritten in a simpler form by mapping the qubit density matrix to a polarization vector S t via t 1 S t 2, where x,y,z are the Pauli matrices. For instance, one obtains for the symmetric case, o 0, r 2 Sz 2 0 Sy 9a 0 Sz d r 2 Sy 9b d 2 r 2 Sx Sx 9c where t 2 r d 2 r . One finds that Eqs. have a form of the Bloch equations for spin precession in the magnetic field27, where the effect of environment is accounted for by two relaxation times for the different spin components the longitudinal T1 and the transverse T2, related to d and 2 r as T 1 d 2 r 2 , and T 1 d r 2 , The corresponding damping rates, the so called depolar ization and the dephasing are used for phenomenological description of two level systems34. However, neither 1 nor 2 taken alone would drive the qubit density matrix into a statistical mixture Eq. or into a pure state Eq. . In contrast, our definition of decoherence and relax ation excitation is associated with two opposite effects of the environment on the qubit the first drives it into a statistical mixture, whereas the second drives it into a pure state. We expect therefore that such a natural distinction between decoherence and relaxation would be more useful for finding a relation between these quantities and the environmental behavior than other alternative definitions of these quantities existing in the literature. In general, the two rates, d,r, introduced in phe nomenological equations , , are consistent with our definitions of decoherence and relaxation. The only ex ception is the case of , where are no transitions between the qubit s states even in the pres ence of the environment static qubit . One easily finds from Eqs. 3a , that 12 t 0 for t , whereas the diagonal density matrix elements of the qubit remain unchanged so called pure dephasing 5,34 t t 11 0 0 22 . 5 Thus, if the initial probabilities of finding the qubit in each of its states are not equal, 11 22 , then the final qubit state

Chunk: f h E consists of all objects X in C such that X A is a multiple of A. Since A is the regular object of E, it follows that f h E E and f . Proving that h . Let G be a finite group, let Z3 G, k , and let G be the canonical algebra in Rep G Z Vec G . Then the category of A modules in Z Vec G is equivalent to Vec G and the functor of taking the free A module coincides with the forgetful functor from Z Vec G to Vec G. This is straightforward and is left to the reader. Remark 4.6. Our reconstruction of the representation category of a twisted group double from a Lagrangian subcategory can be viewed as a categorical analogue of the following reconstruction of the double of a quasi Lie bialgebra from a Manin pair i.e., a pair consisting of a metric Lie algebra and its Lagrangian subalgebra in the theory of quantum groups Dr, Section 2 . Let g be a finite dimensional metric Lie algebra i.e., a Lie algebra on which a nondegenerate invariant symmetric bilinear form is given . Let l be a Lagrangian subalgebra of g. Then l has a structure of a quasi Lie bialgebra and there is an isomorphism between g and the double D l of l. The correspondence between Lagrangian subalgebras of g and doubles isomorphic to g is bijective, see Dr, Section 2 for details. Remark 4.7. Given a hyperbolic modular category C there is no canonical way to assign to it a pair G, such that Vec G as a braided fusion category. Indeed, it follows from EG1 that there exist non isomorphic finite groups G1, G2 such that Z VecG1 Z VecG2 as braided fusion categories. See also N . Theorem 4.8. Let C be a modular category such that dim C n2, n Z , and such that C 1. Assume that C contains a symmetric subcategory V such that dim V n. Then either C is the center of a pointed category or it contains an object with non integer dimension. Proof. Assume that V is not isotropic. Then V contains an isotropic subcategory K such that dim K 1 2 dim V this follows from Deligne s description of symmetric categories, see 2.7 . Hence the category K modularization of K has dimension 4 and central charge 1. It follows from the explicit classification given in Example 5.1 b , d that the category K contains an isotropic subcategory of dimension 2 clearly this subcategory is equivalent to Rep Z 2Z . Let Z 2Z be the commutative algebra of dimension 2 in this subcategory. Let I K K be the right adjoint functor to the modularization functor F K K . We claim that the object A I A1 has a canonical structure of a C algebra. Indeed, we have a canonical morphism in Hom F A , A1 Hom A, I A1 Hom A, A id. Using this one can construct a multiplication on A via Hom A1 A1, A1 Hom F A F A , A1 Hom F A A , A1 Hom A A, A . Since 14 VLADIMIR DRINFELD, SHLOMO GELAKI, DMITRI NIKSHYCH, AND VICTOR OSTRIK the functor F is braided it follows from the commutativity of A1 that A is commu tative. Other conditions from Definition 4.1 are also easy to check. In particular dim A dim K dim A1 dim V p dim C . We also note that the category RepK A contains precisely two simple objects actually, the functor M 7 I M is an equivalence of categories between Rep K A1 and RepK A we will call these two objects 1 for A itself considered as an A module and .

Chunk: Subsection 2.6 for the definition of multiplicative central charge. In order to avoid confusion we note that our definition of multiplicative central charge is different from the definition of central charge of a modular functor from BK, 5.7.10 in fact, the central charge from BK equals to the square of our central charge. Remark 1.4. If p 2 then it is easy to see that i implies ii see, e.g., GN . 1.2. Interpretation in terms of group theoretical fusion categories and semisimple quasi Hopf algebras. The notion of group theoretical fusion cate gory was introduced in ENO, O1 . Group theoretical categories form a large class of well understood fusion categories which can be explicitly constructed from finite group data which justifies the name . For example, as far as we know, all currently known semisimple Hopf algebras have group theoretical representation categories however, there are semisimple quasi Hopf algebras whose representation categories are not group theoretical, see ENO . Theorem 1.5. Let C be a fusion category such that all objects of C have integer dimension and such that its center Z C is nilpotent. Then C is group theoretical. Remark 1.6. A consequence of this theorem is the following statement every semisimple quasi Hopf algebra of prime power dimension is group theoretical in the sense of ENO, Definition 8.40 . This provides a partial answer to a question asked in ENO . 1.3. Idea of the proof. We describe here the main steps in the proof of The orem 1.3. First we characterize centers of pointed fusion categories in terms of Lagrangian subcategories and show that a modular category C is equivalent to the representation category of a twisted group double if and only if it has a Lagrangian i.e., maximal isotropic subcategory of dimension p dim C . This result is remi niscent to the characterization of doubles of quasi Lie bialgebras in terms of Manin pairs Dr, Section 2 . GROUP THEORETICAL PROPERTIES OF NILPOTENT MODULAR CATEGORIES 3 Thus we need to show that a category satisfying the assumptions of Theorem 1.3 contains a Lagrangian subcategory. The proof is inspired by the following result for nilpotent metric Lie algebras i.e, Lie algebras with an invariant non degenerate scalar product which can be derived from KaO if g is a nilpotent metric Lie algebra of even dimension then g contains an abelian ideal k, which is Lagrangian i.e., such that . The relevance of metric Lie algebras to our considerations is explained by the fact that they appear in Dr as classical limits of quasi Hopf algebras. In fact, our proof is a categorification of the proof of the above result. Thus we need some categorical versions of linear algebra constructions involved in this proof. Remarkably, the categorical counterparts exist for all notions required. For example the notion of orthogonal complement in a metric Lie algebra is replaced by the notion of centralizer in a modular tensor category introduced by M. M uger Mu2 . 1.4. Organization of the paper. Section 2 is devoted to preliminaries on fusion categories, which include nilpotent fusion categories, pre modular categories, cen tralizers, Gauss sums and central charge, and Deligne s classification of symmetric fusion categories. In Section 3 we define the notions of isotropic and Lagrangian subcategories of a premodular category C, generalizing the corresponding notions for a metric group which is, by definition, a finite abelian group with a quadratic form . We then recall a construction, due to A. Brugui eres Br and M. M uger Mu1 , which associates to a premodular category C the quotient by its centralizer, called a modularization. We prove in Theorem 3.4 an invariance property of the central charge with respect to the modularization. This result will be crucial in the proof of Theorem 6.5. We also study properties of subcategories of modular categories and explain in Proposition 3.9 how one

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0196v2 hep ph 12 Apr 2007 1 TPJU 03 2007 Remarks on Nc dependence of decays of exotic baryons Karolina Pie sciuk and Micha l Prasza lowicz M. Smoluchowski Institute of Physics, Jagellonian University, Reymonta 4, 30 049 Krak ow, Poland We calculate the Nc dependence of the decay widths of exotic eikosiheptaplet within the framework of Chral Quark Soliton Model. We also discuss generalizations of regular baryon representations for arbitrary Nc. 1. Introduction One of the most puzzling results of the chiral quark soliton model QSM for exotic baryons consists in a very small hadronic decay width,1 governed by the decay constant G10. While the small mass of exotic states is rather generic for all chiral models1 3 the smallness of the decay width appears as a subtle cancelation of three different terms that contribute to G10. Decay width in solitonic models4 is calculated in terms of a matrix element M of the collective axial current operator corresponding to the emission of a pseudoscalar meson 1 see Ref. 5 for criticism of this approach O 3 3 X G0 D i G1 dibc D b Sc G2 3 D 8 Si pi . For notation see Ref. 1 . Constants G0,1,2 are constructed from the so called moments of inertia that are calculable in QSM. The decay width is given as B B 1 8 p M M p3 M M A2. The bar over the amplitude squared denotes averaging over initial and summing over final spin and, if explicitly indicated, over isospin . For B B for spin up and p 0, 0, p we have , B O 101 2, 8 8 B 10 B p and . e mail address yessien gmail.com e mail address michal if.uj.edu.pl typeset using PTPTEX.cls 2 K. Pie sciuk and M. Prasza lowicz In order to have an estimate of the width the authors of Ref. 1 calculated G10 in the nonrelativistic limit6 of QSM and got G10 0. It has been shown that this cancelation between terms that scale differently with Nc G0 N 3 2 c , G1,2 N 1 2 c is in fact consistent with large Nc counting,7 since . In the nonrelativistic limit NRL Nc 2 G, , , G N 1 2 c . In this paper we ask whether the similar cancelation takes place for the decays of 27 of spin 1 2 and 3 2. We also discuss the possible modifications of the Nc depen dence of the decay width due to the different choice of the large Nc generalizations of regular SU multiplets. 2. Baryons in large Nc limit Soliton is usually quantized as quantum mechanical symmetric top with two moments of inertia I1,2 M R S 1 1 2I2 C2 R S S 1 N 2 c 12 R B . Here S denotes baryon spin, C2 R the Casimir operator for the SU representation p, q C2 R 1 3 p2 q2 pq 3 p q and quantities R B denote matrix elements of the SU breaking hamiltonian H Nc 3 D 88 Y 3 D 8A JA. Model parameters that can be found in Ref. 8 Nc 3 , ms K2 I2 , 2ms K1 I1 K2 I2 , 2 Nc ms mu md N scale with Nc in the following way i1, ,2 Nc where i1,2 O N 0 c , , , O msN 0 c . Here N is pion nucleon sigma term and mq denote current quark masses. Numer ically , . So far we have specified explicit Nc dependence that follows from the fact that model parameters are given in terms of the quark loop. Another type of the Remarks on Nc dependence 3 Nc dependence comes from the constraint9 that selects SU flavor representations p, q containing states with hypercharge . Therefore for arbitrary Nc ordinary baryons are built of quarks and antiquarks with hypercharge 1 2 and 1 2, respectively. For example , the decuplet is given by 9 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 9 1. However, as it has been noticed in the literature,10 the constraint9 can be modified in such a way that p, q contain states with hypercharge 0 and 1 2, respectively. This leads to a modified soliton representation of exotic baryons. In this case the decuplet is given by 9 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 9 0. The difference between ordinary and exotic representations of baryons is quite marginal and may be difficult to spot experimentally. It may be also difficult to detect in the large Nc expansion. However, it is worth noticing that the exotic representation contains no states with zero hypercharge. As we will see later, this feature may turn out to be important for the large Nc behavior of the

The fact that 10 8 0 in large Nc limit triggered recently discussion on the validity of the semiclassical quantization for exotic states.11 Since in the chiral limit the momentum p of the outgoing meson scales according to , overall Nc dependence of the decay width is strongly affected by its third power B B 1 N 2c O A2 O p3 . Phenomenologically, however, scaling is not sustained. Indeed, meson mo menta in and decays are almost identical assuming M 1540 MeV p 225 MeV, pK 268 MeV.

For the decays into 10 we have 27 10 that scales like O and 27 N10 K that scales like O 1 Nc . The resulting scaling of 27 B calculated from Eq. reads as follows 6 K. Pie sciuk and M.

Alternative choices for large Nc multiplets So far we have only considered the standard generalization of baryonic SU flavor representations for large Nc. This choice is based on the requirement that generalized baryonic states have physical spin, isospin and strangeness, however their hypercharge and charge are not physical.10 Moreover, the generalization of the octet is not selfadjoint and antidecuplet is not complex conjugate of decuplet. Some years ago it has been proposed to consider alternative schemes.12 Fig. 3. Generalization of SU flavor representations in which octet is selfadjoint Fig. 4. Adding triquarks to regular SU baryon representations 8, 10 and 10 corresponds to the representation set of Fig.3. If we require the generalized octet to be self adjoint we are led to the following set of representations 8 Nc 3, Nc 3 , 10 Nc 6 3, Nc 3 3 , 10 10 that are depicted in Figs. 3 and 4. This means that we enlarge Nc in steps of 3 adding each time a uds triquark. Generalized states have physical isospin, hypercharge and charge , but unphysical strangeness and spin that is of the order of Nc. With this Remarks on Nc dependence 7 choice both 10 8, 10 8 0 in large Nc limit 10 Nc 6 1 I1, 10 Nc 6 1 I2.

Queries:
1. What is the relationship between gate freezing and ineffectiveness in random Boolean networks?
2. What information does Lynch Corollary 1, Corollary 3, and Corollary 6 provide about the behavior of gates in random Boolean networks?
3. What is the definition of a Boolean network according to Definitions 3 and 4, and how does it relate to the concept of a gate being directly affected by an input?

In this text, the researchers are looking at the dynamics of random Boolean networks and the behavior of gates within these networks. They discuss various theorems related to gate freezing, ineffectiveness, and other properties. The queries aim to capture the essence of these aspects. The first query asks about the relationship between gate freezing and ineffectiveness. The second query focuses on Lynch's corollaries, which provide more information about the behavior of gates. Lastly, the third query addresses the definition of a Boolean network and its relation to inputs directly affecting a gate.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0199v3 math.CO 17 Nov 2009 DECOMPOSITION NUMBERS FOR FINITE COXETER GROUPS AND GENERALISED NON CROSSING PARTITIONS C. KRATTENTHALER AND T. W. M ULLER Abstract. Given a finite irreducible Coxeter group W, a positive integer d, and types T1, T2, . . . , Td in the sense of the classification of finite Coxeter groups , we compute the number of decompositions 1 2 d of a Coxeter element c of W, such that i is a Coxeter element in a subgroup of type Ti in W, , 2, . . ., d, and such that the factorisation is minimal in the sense that the sum of the ranks of the Ti s, , 2, . . ., d, equals the rank of W. For the exceptional types, these decomposition numbers have been computed by the first author in Topics in Dis crete Mathematics, M. Klazar et al. eds. , Springer Verlag, Berlin, New York, 2006, pp. 93 126 and S eminaire Lotharingien Combin. 54 , Article B54l . The type An decomposition numbers have been computed by Goulden and Jackson in Europ. J. Combin. 13 , 357 365 , albeit using a somewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type Bn decomposition numbers from results of B ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux Adv. Appl. Math. 24 , 22 56 on map enumeration. Our formula for the type Dn decomposition numbers is new. These results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer l and fixed integers r1 r2 rl, the number of multi chains 1 2 l in Armstrong s generalised non crossing partitions poset, where the poset rank of i equals ri, and where the block structure of 1 is prescribed. We demonstrate that this result implies all known enumerative re sults on ordinary and generalised non crossing partitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi chain enumeration is new even for the original non crossing partitions of Kreweras. Moreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank selected chain enumeration in the type Dn generalised non crossing partitions poset, which, in turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong s , thus completing a computational proof of the . It also allows to address another conjecture of Armstrong on maximal intervals containing a random multichain in the generalised non crossing partitions poset. 1. Introduction The introduction of non crossing partitions for finite reflection groups finite Coxeter groups by Bessis and Brady and Watt marks the creation of a new, exciting subject of combinatorial theory, namely the study of these new combinatorial objects which possess numerous beautiful properties, and seem to relate to several other ob jects of combinatorics and algebra, most notably to the cluster complex of Fomin and 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

The subject has been enriched by Armstrong through the introduction of multi chains, which are a generalisation of non crossing partitions. The present paper is the first of a series of papers dealing with the enumeration of multi chains in generalised non crossing partitions posets associated with finite Coxeter groups. The key to this enumeration is the computation of the decomposition numbers for finite Coxeter groups and generalised non crossing partitions.

Chunk: Again, these generalised non crossing partitions possess numerous beautiful properties, and seem to relate to several other objects of combinatorics and algebra, most notably to the generalised cluster complex of Fomin and Reading cf. . From a technical point of view, the main subject matter of the present paper is the computation of the number of certain factorisations of the Coxeter element of a reflection group. These decomposition numbers, as we shall call them from now on see Section 2 for the precise definition , arose in , where it was shown that they play a crucial role in the computation of enumerative invariants of generalised non crossing partitions. Moreover, in these two papers the decomposition numbers for the exceptional reflection groups have been computed, and it was pointed out that the decomposition numbers in type An i.e., the decomposition numbers for the symmetric groups had been earlier computed by Goulden and Jackson in . Here, we explain how the decomposition numbers in type Bn can be extracted from results of B ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux on the enumeration of certain planar maps, and we find formulae for the decomposition numbers in type Dn, thus completing the project of computing the decomposition numbers for all the irreducible reflection groups. The main goal of the present paper, however, is to access the enumerative theory of the generalised non crossing partitions of Armstrong via these decomposition num bers. Indeed, one finds numerous enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non crossing partitions in the literature cf. results on the total number of generalised non crossing partitions of a given size, of those with a fixed number of blocks, of those with a given block structure, results on the number of multi chains of a given length in a given poset of generalised non crossing partitions, results on rank selected chain enumeration that is, results on the number of chains in which the ranks of the elements of the chains have been fixed , etc. We show that not only can all these results be rederived from our decomposition numbers, we are also able to find several new enumerative results. In this regard, the most general type of result that we find is formulae for the number of multi chains 1 2 l 1 in the poset of non crossing partitions of type An, Bn, respectively Dn, in which the block structure of 1 is fixed as well as the ranks of 2, . . ., l 1. Even the corresponding result in type An, for the non crossing partitions of Kreweras, is new. Furthermore, from the result in type Dn, by a suitable summation, we are able to find a formula for the rank selected chain enumeration in the poset of generalised non crossing partitions of type Dn, thus generalising the earlier formula of Athanasiadis and Reiner for the rank selected chain enumeration of ordinary non crossing partitions of type Dn. In conjunction with the results from , this generalisation in turn allows us to complete a computational case by case proof of Armstrong s 1, Conjecture 5.3.2 predicting a surprising relationship between a certain face count in the DECOMPOSITION NUMBERS FOR FINITE COXETER GROUPS 3 generalised cluster complex of Fomin and Reading and the M obius function in the poset of generalised non crossing partitions of Armstrong. A case free proof had been found earlier by Tzanaki in . Our results allow us also to address another conjecture of Armstrong 1, Conj. 3.5.13 on maximal intervals containing a random multichain in the poset of generalised non crossing partitions. We show that the conjecture is indeed true for types An and Bn, but that it fails for type Dn and we suspect that it will also fail for most of the exceptional types . We remark that a totally different approach to the enumerative theory of gener alised non crossing partitions is

Chunk: the question has to be answered what the individual contri butions of the resonant excited states of the nucleon to the electric and magnetic polarizabilities are and how the contributions of the pion cloud to the electric and magnetic polarizabilities may be specified. To the author s knowledge such an investigation has not been carried out before. 2 Electromagnetic polarizabilities obtained from the forward angle sum rule for and the backward angle sum rule for The appropriate tool for the present investigation is to simultaneously apply the forward angle sum rule for and the backward angle sum rule for . This leads to the following relations s t, 2 Z 0 A , E1, M2, B , M1, E2, d 2 , e g NN 12 2 m2 f 7.6, and s t, 2 Z 0 A , M1, E2, B , E1, M2, d 2 , e g NN 12 2 m2 f 7.6, m2 2 m, A 1 2 1 r 1 2 m ! , B 1 2 1 r 1 2 m ! . In is the photon energy in the lab system, m the pion mass and m the nucleon mass. The quantities s, s are the s channel electric and magnetic polarizabilities, and t, t the t channel electric and magnetic polarizabilities, respectively. The multipole content of the 2 photoabsorption cross section enters through , E1, M2, , E1 , M2 , , M1, E2, , M1 , E2 , i.e. through the sums of cross sections with change and without change of parity during the electromagnetic transition, respectively1. The multipoles belonging to parity change are favored for the electric polarizability s whereas the multipoles belonging to parity nonchange are fa vored for the magnetic polarizability s. The coefficients A and B in Eqs. , , and multiplying the cross sections of the parity favored and parity nonfavored multipoles, respectively, are A 1.07 and B 0.07 at the pion photoproduction threshold. They in crease with photon energy, as expected for relativistic correction factors. Using A and B it is easy to prove that s is given by the Baldin or Baldin Lapidus BL sum rule, whereas s is given by the s channel part of the BEFT sum rule. For the t channel parts, t and t, we use the predictions obtained from the meson pole representation2 with properties as predicted by the quark level Nambu Jona Lasinio model . The quantities entering into this prediction are 1 137.04, the pion nucleon coupling constant, g .169 0.057, the pion decay constant, f 92.42 0.26 MeV, and the meson mass, m 666.0 MeV . For convenience we summarize the arguments leading to the relations and . The flavor wave functions of the 0 and the meson are given by 0 1 2 u u d d , 1 2 u u d d . This leads to the decay matrix elements M 5 3M 0 5 3 e f . Using the NJL model or the dynamical L M with dimensional regularization we arrive at mcl 4 f cl Nc , where mcl and f cl 89.8 MeV are the meson mass and the decay constant in the chiral limit cl and . Then the mass of the meson is given by m q mcl 2 m2 666 MeV. Inserting this into NNM 2 m2 and using f NN and . 1It should be noted that this separation into cross sections for separate multipoles is possible in the presently used fixed dispersion theory applied at 0 and , whereas in the corresponding formulas based on fixed t dispersion theory terms containing mixed products of CGLN amplitudes occur for a discussion see . 2This meson pole in the complex t plane of the Compton scattering amplitude A s, t is not the same, but has relations with the meson pole introduced to parameterize the scattering amplitude.

Note that we use the same symbols 1, 2, to denote the anti involutions for H Dn and Hc Dn in Proposition 3.7, as those on H Dn are the restrictions from those on Hc Dn via the isomorphism in Theorem 4.4 below. The proposition is thus established via the isomorphism in Theorem 4.4, or follows by a direct computation as in the proof of Proposition 3.7. 4.3. The algebra H W of type Bn. Definition 4.3. Let u, v C, and . The degenerate spin affine Hecke algebra of type Bn, denoted by H W or H Bn, is the algebra generated by C b1, . . . , bn and CW subject to the following relations tibi bi 1 i n 1 j i, i 1, 1 i n 1 tnbn bitn i n .

Theorem 4.4 also holds for WAn 1 see W1 . Proof. We only need to show that preserves the defining relations in Hc W which involve xi s. Let . Here, we will verify two such relations below. The verification of the remaining relations is simpler and will be skipped.

It follows from the definition that H W is spanned by the elements of the form b where runs over a basis for CW and Zn . By Theo rem 4.4, we have an isomorphism Cn H W Hc W . Observe that the im age b are linearly independent in Hc W by the PBW basis Theorem 3.11 for Hc W . Hence the elements b are linearly independent in H W . 4.6. The even center for H W .

By the PBW basis Theorem 2.3 for Hc W , the elements of the form 1 2x1 2x2 . . . 1 2xn are linearly independent in Hc W . It follows that the image of these elements under the isomorphism Cn H W Hc W is linearly independent in H W . In particular, the elements b2 1 , . . . , b2 n are linearly independent in H W .

This induced module is of independent interest. This approach will then be used for type D and B. Theorem 3.4. Let . The multiplication of subalgebras C h , Cn, and CW induces a vector space isomorphism C h Cn CW Hc W . 10 TA KHONGSAP AND WEIQIANG WANG Equivalently, x co w Zn , o Zn 2, w W forms a linear basis for Hc W called a PBW basis . Proof. Note that IND C x1, . . . , xn Cn admits an algebra structure by , and . By the explicit defining relations of Hc W , we can verify that the algebra Hc W acts on IND by letting xi and ci act by left multiplication, and si Sn act by si. fco f sicsio u f f si xi 1 xi ucici 1f f sicici 1 xi 1 xi co .

Note that the algebra Hc W is spanned by the elements of the form x co w. It remains to show that these elements are linearly independent. Suppose that S P a o wx co , o , w and that some coefficient a o w 0 we fix one such o . Now consider the action S on an element of the form xN1 1 xN2 2 xNn n for N1 N2 Nn 0. Let w be such that xN1 1 xN2 2 xNn n w is maximal among all possible w with a o w 0 for some . Let be the largest element among all with a o w 0. Then among all monomials in S xN1 1 xN2 2 xNn n , the monomial x xN1 1 xN2 2 xNn n wco appears as a maximal term with coefficient a o w. It follows from o . This is a contradiction, and hence the elements x co w are linearly independent. Remark 3.5. By the PBW Theorem 3.4, the Hc W module IND introduced in the above proof can be identified with the Hc W module induced from the trivial CW module.

Chunk: lemmas 5 . The universality of the family of observables Z X, Z, X Y 2 is reduced to the ability to simulate any Pauli operators. Lemma 7 resp. lemma 6 , shows that x z can be simulated with probability 1 2, moreover if the simulation fails, the resulting state is same as the original one. Thus, this simulation can be repeated until a full simulation of x z . Finally, z x can be simulated, up to a global phase, by combining simulations of x and z. Thus, Z X, Z, X Y 2 is approximatively universal using only one ancillary qubit. 5. Conclusion We have proved a new upper bound on the minimal resources required for measurement based QC one two qubit, and two one qubit observables are universal, using one ancillary qubit only. This new upper bound has experimental applications, but allows also to prove that the trade off between observables and ancillary qubits, conjectured in , does not exist. This new upper bound is not tight since the lower bound on the minimal resources for this model is one two qubit observable and one ancillary qubit.

Chunk: TO APPEAR IN THE ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL Preprint typeset using LATEX style emulateapj v. 10 09 06 A SPITZER CENSUS OF THE IC 348 NEBULA AUGUST A. MUENCH1, CHARLES J. LADA1, K. L. LUHMAN2,3, JAMES MUZEROLLE4 ERICK YOUNG4 Submitted November 20, 2006 Accepted March 30, 2007 Version February 5, 2008 ABSTRACT Spitzer mid infrared surveys enable accurate census of young stellar objects by sampling large spatial scales, revealing very embedded protostars and detecting low luminosity objects. Taking advantage of these capabilities, we present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and embedded star cluster, covering a 2.5 pc region and comparable in extent to the Orion nebula. Our Spitzer census supplemented with ground based spectra has added 42 class II T Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified 20 class 0 I protostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census of IC 348 reveals a population of class I protostars that is anti correlated spatially with the class II III T Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around a B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery about 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We further find that the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that rate which built the older exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold, starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population indicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. Moreover, we show that the IC 348 cluster is of order 3 5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its smooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While it seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of dynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our finding of a filamentary ridge of class I protostars supports a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller sub clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the supposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should not preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived. Subject headings infrared stars circumstellar matter open clusters and associations individual IC 348 1. INTRODUCTION The IC 348 nebula on the northeastern corner of the Perseus Molecular Cloud Barnard 1915 has been known to har bor pre main sequence T Tauri stars since they were revealed through a slitless H grism survey by Herbig . Slit less H grism surveys were once the most powerful tool for searching for young stars c.f., Herbig Bell 1988 , while the subsequent development of infrared bolometers permit ted better census of the darker regions of molecular clouds, including very young protostars which are young stars that still retain infalling envelopes. Such infrared observations in IC 348 by Strom et al. led, for example, to the discov ery of an optically invisible bright 2 m source about 1pc from the clustering of H members. Strom s IR source was the first such hint that the stars forming in the IC 348 nebula might not all have the same age. Modern tools for identifying young stars include X ray surveys, which parse young stellar ob jects YSOs using energetic emissions from their rotationally enhanced, magnetic activity, and wide field infrared imaging surveys, which identify YSOs using the signature in the star s broadband spectral energy distribution SED of thermal re processing of the star s light by an optically thick circumstel lar disk. To date roughly 300 young stars have been identi fied in the IC 348 nebula from X ray e.g., Preibisch Zin necker 2001, 2004 , optical e.g., Trullols Jordi 1997 Herbig Jones 1990 , and radio e.g., Menten Eisloffel 1991 surveys, but given the incompleteness of all of these surveys, it is difficult to know whether this number is near the actual total of young stars. Here we present the results of the first Spitzer Space Telescope survey of the IC 348 nebula.

Chunk: 70 larger cluster area, correspond to a different definition of the spectral index and include class III by their definition sources thus, we do not further discuss the statistics of this Legacy project. Fi nally, we did not search for new members with anemic type disks 2. 3 8 .8 Paper I since a search for sources with very small excesses can be hampered by poor photometry, in this case due to the nebula see the scatter in the power law fit sigma overplotted Figure 2 . We subdivided the 3 8 .8 YSO sample into two classes based on the shape of the 3 8 m distribution function thick disk class II sources in the peak, 1. 3 8 .5 and class I protostellar candidates with 3 8 .5. Flat spectrum sources, considered to be protostars in a later stage of envelope dispersal or with highly flared disks, can have slightly falling mid infrared SED slopes, 0. 0.3 Lada 1987 . A distinction between highly flared class II disks and emission from disk remnant envelope may re quire data at wavelengths longer than 10 m. There are a total of 136 candidate class II sources in our IC 348 Spitzer re gion and 56 red class I candidates. For comparison to other Spitzer studies of YSOs in clusters that use color color clas sification techniques e.g., Megeath et al. 2004 , we plot two such diagrams in Figure 3. Together these encompassed all 3 band IRAC detected sources protostellar and class II sources are color coded on these plots. Sources parsed by 3 8 m are well segregated in the color color diagram except where pho tometric errors in a single color yield some scattering. 2.2. Class II census results 2.2.1. Membership In this section we explore the membership status of the 136 class II candidates identified in 2.1, revealing that the vast majority of them are confirmed spectroscopicallly as mem bers. Seventy six of our 136 3 8 m selected class II ob jects were cataloged previously as members of IC 348 Her big 1998 Luhman et al. 1998b Luhman 1999 Luhman et al. 2003b, 2005a . For this paper we obtained optical and near infrared spectroscopy of 34 more class II sources these ob servations are detailed in Appendix B and in Table 1 we list new members with spectral types. From the remaining 26 et al. Appendix A and Figure 22 due at least in part to silicate absorption in the 8.0 m bandpass 3 it is somewhat less contaminated by PAH emission than the 8.0 m bandpass frequently evident in the SEDs of non cluster sources. FIG. 4. Additional class II candidates considered to be IC 348 mem bers but lacking spectral types. Again, sources are sorted according to their 5.8 m magnitude, which is listed in parenthesis below each source ID. Plot ting symbols, line thickness and line color alternate from SED to SED for clarity. class II candidates, we identified an additional eight sources whose SEDs suggest they are high quality candidates 55308, 10031, 1287, 1379, 22865, 753 see Figure 4 and Table 2 . The four latter objects are very faint see also Figure 6 , and if they are cluster members rather than background sources e.g. galaxies then they are almost certainly brown dwarfs given their low luminosities. Three sources classified initially as class II sources using IRAC data were reclassi fied as protostellar 2.3 based on their MIPS SEDs. The remaining sources were class II contaminants, consisting of either HH knots or false excesses sources detected in only 3 bands and contaminated by nebular emission . We con clude that the technique of using 3 8 m as a discriminator of class II YSOs is successful for roughly 90 of the initial class II sample 118 members from 136 candidates .

Chunk: dot can be empty, singly occupied with spin up or down, or doubly occupied, denoted by 0 , , , D d d 0 , with energies E0, E E , ED. For convenience we define the detuning as ED U. The dot dynamics is fully described by its reduced density matrix D, with matrix elements P 1 2 D 2 1. The dot pair amplitude is given by the off diagonal matrix element P 0 D. The time evolution of the reduced density matrix is described by the kinetic equations d dtP 1 2 t i h E 1 E 2 P 1 2 t X 1, 2 Z t t0 dt W 1 1 2 2 t, t P 1 2 t . We define the generalized transition rates by W 1 1 2 2 R t dt W 1 1 2 2 t, t , which are the only quantities to be evaluated in the stationary limit. Together with the normalization condition P P 1, determines the matrix elements of D. Furthermore, in we retain only linear terms in the tunnel strengths and the detuning . Hence, we calculate the rates W 1 1 2 2 to the lowest first order in for 0. This is justified in the transport regime S, N, kBT. The rates are evaluated by means of a real time diagrammatic technique , that we generalize to include superconducting leads. This technique provides a convenient tool to perform a systematic perturbation expansion of the transport properties in powers of the tunnel coupling strength. In the following, we concentrate on transport processes to first order in tunnelling a generalization to higher orders is straightforward . This includes the transfer of charges through the tunnelling barriers as well as energy renormalization terms that give rise to nontrivial dynamics of the quantum dot degrees of freedom. We find for the first order diagonal rates W 1 2 W 1 2 1 2 the expressions W NfN U 2 W0 N 1 fN U 2 WD NfN U 2 W N 1 fN U 2 . The N lead also contributes to the rates W DD W 00 DD N 1 fN U 2 fN U 2 iB where Re h 1 2 iU 2 N 2 kBT 1 2 i U 2 N 2 kBT i , with N being the chemical potential of the normal lead and z the Digamma function. Notice that B vanishes when 0. The superconducting leads do not enter here due to the gap in the quasi particle density of states. These leads, though, contribute to the off diagonal rates W 00 W 0D 00 W 0D DD W D0 W 00 D0 W DD D0 i S cos 2 . For an intuitive representation of the system dynamics we define, in analogy to , a dot isospin by . Non Equilibrium Josephson and Andreev Current through Interacting Quantum Dots 7 From , we find that in the stationary limit the isospin dynamics can be separated into three parts, dI dt acc dI dt rel dI dt rot, with h dI dt !

Non equilibrium Josephson current In the isospin language the current in the superconducting leads is JSL, h S Iy cos 2 Ix sin 2 , where the upper lower sign refers to the left right superconducting lead. The Iy component contributes to the Andreev current, while Ix is responsible for the Josephson current. To obtain subgap transport, we first need to build up a finite isospin component along the

Queries:
1. What is the detuning defined as in the context of a quantum dot?
2. What is the role of the reduced density matrix in describing the dynamics of a quantum dot?
3. How are the generalized transition rates evaluated in the stationary limit for a quantum dot?

Answers:
1. The detuning is defined as the difference between the energies of the doubly occupied and singly occupied states of a quantum dot.
2. The reduced density matrix describes the dynamics of a quantum dot by representing the probabilities associated with different states of the dot, allowing for the calculation of the dot pair amplitude and other properties.
3. In the stationary limit, the generalized transition rates are evaluated by calculating the rates of transfer between different states of the quantum dot, using a real-time diagrammatic technique. These rates are then used to determine the matrix elements of the reduced density matrix and, ultimately, the transport properties of the quantum dot.

For example, in the case of the Orstein Uhlenbeck process, Eq. , should be larger than the relaxation time of the total intensity. The validity of the above reduction has been carefully checked against simulations of the complete model . For the scope of the present work, we performed a fur ther check by comparing the spectrum of fluctuations of r2 with the imposed one, Eq. . Indeed, the behaviour is the same for TR while for shorter some differ ences are detected. This means that the reduced descrip tion discussed below becomes less and less accurate. On the other hand, in this regime spontaneous fluctuation should dominate and this limitation become less relevant for our purposes.

Chunk: thus change the value of the 1, 1 entry of ax x,x,x. But this entry is invariant under change of basis. Therefore no Galois automorphism corresponds to a change in basis, and the four solutions given above are mutually monoidally inequivalent. 5. Proof of Theorem 1 part 2 rigidity structures This section explicitly computes rigidity structures for the categories given in the previous section. Rigidity implies that these categories are fusion categories. Given v1 xx V 1 xx, choose a vector vxx 1 V xx 1 such that vxx 1 v1 x, see Figure 2 . Now we define right death and birth, dx v1 xx x x 1, bx 1 vxx 1 1 x x see Figure 3 . With these definitions, right rigidity is an easy consequence by direct computa tion. The following is a graphical version of it 1 idx, 1 idx where the first and the third equalities are from the definitions above, and the second equalities are the associativity x xxx and x xxx 1, respectively. 12 TOBIAS J.

Hexagon equalities The same morphisms give a left rigidity structure when treated as left birth and left death. Treat the objects y and 1 analogously by replacing with 1. 6. Proof of Theorem 1 part 3 the absence of braidings The categories under consideration are known not to be braided see . How ever, once associativity matrices are known it is in principle not difficult to classify braidings by direct computation. In this section we perform this computation and show that no braidings are possible. A braiding consists of a natural family of isomorphisms such that two hexagon equalities hold cx,y z y,x,z y cx,z x,y,z cx,yz y,z,x and cy,x 1 z y,x,z y cz,x 1 x,y,z cyz,x 1 y,z,x. SOME NON BRAIDED FUSION CATEGORIES OF RANK 3 13 y x z 7 x y ,y x y z , y x z 7 x y rz x,y x y z Figure 5. Isomorphisms Rz x,y and Rz x,y We define isomorphisms Rz x,y V z yx V z xy by f 7 cx,y f and Rz x,y V z yx V z xy by f 7 cx,y 1 f for any f V z yx. Figure 5 shows the 1 dimensional case where rz x,y is nonzero and rz x, rz y,x 1. For higher dimensional spaces it can be expressed as an invertible matrix, also denoted rz x,y on the canonically ordered basis as before. With this linear isomorphism, the hexagon equations are equivalent to the equa tions sRs x,zV t ys t y,x,z sRs x,yV t t y,z,x sV s yzRt x,s t x,y,z, and s Rs x,zV t ys t y,x,z s Rs x,yV t t y,z,x sV s yz Rt x,s t x,y,z. The first two equalities follow from the definitions and the last two are the hexagon axioms for a braiding. However, the associativity conditions are not satisfied. 7. Proof of Theorem 1 part 3 the existence of certain fusion categories The main result of this section is the classification of certain fusion categories. This is done by finding a set of commuting and associative isomorphisms and then proving that these isomorphisms satisfy the conditions of a fusion category. The categories considered in this paper have this property. The classification is done by explicitly constructing the associated ribbon category and proving that this ribbon category is isomorphic to the category of modules over a commutative algebra. 8. Concluding remarks We have shown that the categories considered in this paper are fusion categories and that they are not braided. They are not isomorphic to the standard categories of modules over a commutative algebra. 9. Appendix A: proof of the associativity of isomorphisms We now prove the associativity of the isomorphisms Rz x,y. Rz x,y is an isomorphism from V z yx to V z xy. It is associative if and only if the composition Rz x

Chunk: the existence and deriving a contradiction. We need five 2 dimensional hexagon equations as follows Hx y,x,x Rx y,x I2 x x,y,x Rx y,x x x,x,y I2 Rx y,x x y,x,x Hx y,x,x Rx y,x I2 x x,y,x Rx y,x x x,x,y I2 Rx y,x x y,x,x Hx x,y,x Rx x,x 1 x y,x,x Rx x,y x y,x,x 1 Rx x,x x x,y,x Hx x,y,x Rx x,x 1 x y,x,x Rx x,y x y,x,x 1 Rx x,x x x,y,x H1 x,x,x Rx x,x 1 1 x,x,x Rx x,x 1 x,x,x I2 R1 x,x 1 x,x,x These are of the following forms, respectively rx y,x 2 1 0 0 1 rx y,x 0 b 1 b 0 0 1 1 0 rx x,y 2 1 0 0 1 rx x,y 1 0 b 1 b 0 0 1 1 0 rx x,y k l m n 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 k l m n 1 0 0 1 rx y,x 1 k l m n 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 k l m n 1 1 0 0 1 d k l m n 1 b 1 b k l m n d2r1 x,x 1 b 1 b 2 where k l m n represents the matrix rx x,x. From the first four equations, we get rx y, , rx x, , ,yk, ,yl, ,xk, which imply 0 since rx x,y rx y,x as above. Now from the final one we get ,x b 1 and ,x 1 b , and the later equality means ,x 1 b by substituting ,yl. We get easily a contradiction for either case i. 14 TOBIAS J.

Equivalent hexagon equalities 7. Pivotal structures and sphericity Let C be a rigid monoidal category. A pivotal structure for C is a monoidal natural isomorphism from to Id. A strict pivotal structure is a pivotal structure which is the identity. In a pivotal monoidal category, the right trace trr of an endomorphism f x x is given by trr f bx f Idx 1 x Idx dx . The left trace trl is given by trl f bx f Idx x Idx dx . A pivotal monoidal category is spherical if . Pivotal structures may not be unique. For example, in a fusion category with object types given by a finite group G, group multiplication as tensor product and trivial associativity matrices, any group homomorphism G C induces a pivotal structure. Furthermore, pivotal structures depend on choices of rigidity. However, if one chooses a new rigidity structure with b , then x gives a new pivotal structure inducing the same traces as . For a strictified skeletal fusion category, we shall assume the rigidity structure and pivotal structure are chosen in such a way that the traces are unaffected by changing the rigidity structure. There is no loss of generality in this assumption since any spherical fusion category can be strictified. In this case, the pivotal structure can be described as a choice of a dual object for each object in the category. The dual object for an object x is an object y such that the pentagon axiom x,x,x,x,y x,x,x,y x,y,x,y x,x,y,x y,x,y x,y,x,y is satisfied. This property is unique for each object x.

Chunk: by vx xy V x xy, vx yx V x yx, v1 yy V 1 yy, v1 xx V 1 xx, vy xx V y xx, v1 and v2 V x xx where the two vectors v1 and v2 are linearly independent. There are 30 associativities. It is a well known fact that if at least one of the bottom objects is 1 then the associativity is trivial. That is, with the above basis choices the matrix for z u,v,w is trivial if at least one of the u, v and w is 1. Now we have ten non trivial 1 dimensional associativities, y y,y,y, x x,y,y, x y,y,x, 1 x,y,x, y x,y,x, x y,x,y, 1 x,x,y, y x,x,y, 1 y,x,x, and y y,x,x, five non trivial 2 dimensional ones, x x,y,x, x x,x,y, x y,x,x, 1 x,x,x, and y x,x,x, and one 6 dimensional one, x x,x,x. 4.2. Normalizations. With the above basis choices we obtain a basis for each tensor product of vector spaces in a canonical way and can parameterize each associativity and pentagon equation. However, at this point our basis elements have not been uniquely specified, and we should expect to obtain solutions with free parameters. As the calculation progresses it will be convenient to simplify the pentagon equations by requiring certain coefficients of certain associativity matrices to be 1 or 0. These normalizations should be thought of as restrictions on the basis choices made above. Normalizations simplify the equations and have an additional advantage once the set of possible bases is sufficiently restricted, Ocneanu rigidity guarantees a finite set of possibilities for the associativity matrices of fusion categories, which can be found algorithmically by computing a Gr obner basis. 4.3. Associativity matrices. The following are the 1 dimensional associativities y y,y,y v1 yyvy y1 7 ay y,y,yv1 yyvy 1y x x,y,y v1 yyvx x1 7 ax x,y,yvx xyvx xy x y,y,x vx yxvx yx 7 ax y,y,xv1 yyvx 1x 1 x,y,x vx yxv1 xx 7 a1 x,y,xvx xyv1 xx y x,y,x vx yxvy xx 7 ay x,y,xvx xyvy xx x y,x,y vx xyvx yx 7 ax y,x,yvx yxvx xy 1 x,x,y vx xyv1 xx 7 a1 x,x,yvy xxv1 yy y x,x,y vx xyvy xx 7 ay x,x,yv1 xxvy 1y 1 y,x,x vy xxv1 yy 7 a1 y,x,xvx yxv1 xx y y,x,x v1 xxvy y1 7 ay y,x,xvx yxvy xx where associativity coefficients are all non zero. For 2 dimensional and 6 dimensional associativities we need to fix the ordering of basis elements in each Hom vector space. The orderings are as follows vx yxv1, vx yxv2 for V x x yx , vx xyv1, vx xyv2 for V x xy x, vx xyv1, vx xyv2 for V x x xy , v1vx xy, v2vx xy for V x xx y, v1vx yx, v2vx yx for V x y xx , vx yxv1, vx yxv2 for V x yx x, v1v1 xx, v2v1 xx for V 1 x xx , v1v1 xx, v2v1 xx for V 1 xx x, v1vy xx, v2vy xx for V y x xx , vx yxv1, vx yxv2 for V x yx y, vx xyv1, vx xyv2 for V x x yx y, vx xyv1, vx xyv2 for V x x xy y, v1 vx, v2 vx for V 1 x xx y, v1vy xx, v2vy xx for V 1 x xy y, v1vx yx, v2vx yx for V 1 y x xx , v1vx yx, v2vx yx for V 1 y xy xx , v1vy xx, v2vy xx for V 1 y y xx , vx yxv1, vx yxv2 for V x yx yx, vx xyv1, vx xyv2 for V x xy yy, vx xyv1, vx xyv2 for V x xxx y, v1v1 xx, v2v1 xx for V 1 x xx y, v1v1 xx

Now, the following are the 2 dimensional pentagon equations using the above 1 dimensional solutions P x y,y,x,x F ,x,y,x ,y,y,x ,x,x,y ,y,x,y ,x,y,y ,x,x,x ,x,x,x ,y,x,x ,y,x,x ,x,y,x ,x,y,x ,x,x,y ,x,x,y 1 eigenvalues, which are of great help when simplifying the pentagon equations by hand. To analyze 2 dimensional and 6 dimensional pentagon equations, at first let s look at the isomorphism interchanging the first and the second factors of tensor products. This change of basis is necessary for 6 dimensional pentagon equations because the image basis of the matrix for u x,y,zw and the domain basis of the matrix for u xy,z,w may not be the same. For P x x,y,x,x, is an isomorphism from the space V 1 xxV x xyV x x1 V y xxV x xyV x xy V x xxV x xyV x xx to V x xyV 1 xxV x x1 V x xyV y xxV x xy V x xyV x xxV x xx, both of SOME NON BRAIDED FUSION CATEGORIES OF RANK 3 9 which correspond to Hom x y x x , x . With the canonically ordered basis v1 xxvx xyvx x1, vy xxvx xyvx xy, vivx xyvj and vx xyv1 xxvx x1, vx xyvy xxvx xy, vx xyvivj , respectively, turns out to be I6. For P x y,x,x,x, P x x,x,y,x and P x x,x,x,y, is also I6. But for P 1 x,x,x,x, it is 1, and for P y x,x,x,x, it is 2, defined as follows 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0, respectively, and for P 1 1 x,x,x,x, it is 1. Then, we can see that the eigenvalues of the pentagon equations are 1 and 2. By looking at the eigenvalues of the pentagon equations, we can analyze the behavior of the pentagon equations. The eigenvalues of the pentagon equations show that the pentagon equations are not simply 6 copies of the 1 dimensional equations. 5 5. 3D pentagon equations with 4 4 matrices. 3D pentagon equations with 4 4 matrices. 3D pentagon equations with 4 4 matrices. 3D pentagon equations with 4 4 matrices. 3D pentagon equations with 4 4 matrices. 3D pentagon equations with 4 4 matrices. 3D pentagon equations with 4 4 matrices. 3D pentagon equations with 4 4 matrices. 3D pentagon equations with 4 4 matrices. 3D pentagon

Chunk: A is of the form 1 0 0 1 , and then get 1 using the above equations. Following is the computation for this At first we may assume that matrix A is of the Jordan canonical form, then I2 or 1 0 0 1 from P x x,y,y,x. We eliminate the possibility I2 from P x y,x,y,x, P 1 x,y,x,x and P x y,x,x,x which imply respectively that , I2 and then det 0, since the first two columns of are scalar multiples of each other. So we conclude 1 0 0 1 . Now we eliminate the possibility ,x,y,x, P x y,y,x,x and P x y,x,x,x, which imply F is a diagonal matrix, with entries 1 and then det 0, respectively. For the case 1 0 0 1 and , F is of the form 0 f 1 f 0 from P x y,x,y,x and P x y,y,x,x, and B is of the form 0 b 1 b 0 from P x x,y,x,y and P x x,x,y,y. If , the first column of has to be zero by comparing the first and the second columns of P x y,x,x,x, P x x,y,x,x, P x x,x,y,x, and P x x,x,x,y. At this point we have fixed all 1 dimensional associativity matrices. From the above equations, we get 0 f 1 f 0 for F and 0 b 1 b 0 for B with the relation f 2 ,x,x,y. We note that the diagonalization of A defines each basis element v1 and v2 only up to choice of a nonzero scalar. By using up one of these degrees of freedom, we may assume .

Chunk: ACIS on days 6533 and 6716. Their ACIS flux corrections for these epochs were thus incorrect. We note that the ACIS photon pileup is not the sole contamination, and Haberl et al. did not consider other issues such as the charge transfer inefficiency and the time dependent quantum efficiency degradation of the ACIS data. A moderate discrepancy 10 is also known between XMM Newton and Chandra due to the imperfect cross calibration between them. Furthermore, SNR 1987A is an extended source as observed with the Chandra ACIS, whereas a pointlike source was apparently assumed by Haberl et al. 1 Radio data obtained with Australian Telescope Compact Array ATCA have been provided by L. Staveley Smith. Considering these technical issues, we have re analyzed the possible effects of ACIS photon pile up on our Chandra observations using three independent methods PIMMS XSPEC simulations, ACIS event grade distribution analysis, and the modified standard ACIS photon pileup model. Our results from these three analyses agree that flux correction factors due to the ACIS photon pileup are roughly several or less, with the exception of day 6157 where 15 of the soft X ray flux appeared to be lost due to photon pileup see Park et al. in preparation for the detailed results . Based on these results, we confirm that the scientific conclusions by Park et al. were not affected by the ACIS photon pileup.

Given j J, let X j be the union of X with the set of all vertices lying in the interior of paths in Pj. As Nab Y there must be an index jab J such that Nab contains at least two vertices in X jab. Note that A , B 2k0k. Thus there are 2k0 1 disjoint pairs a, b for which this index jab must be the same. Let aq, bq , . . . , 2k0 denote these pairs and let j J denote the common index. Note that sj has out type A since we have seen before that no special vertex si with i J has out type B. Claim 3 now implies that sj 1 has in type B. Pick vertices a N A sj and b N B sj 1 such that a a0 and b b0. Claim 2 implies that there are indices q1, . . . , qk0 such that a sends an edge to each aqr. Apply Claim 2 again to find an index r k0 such that b receives an edge from bqr. Let x Naqr bqr and y Na0b0 be distinct vertices such that x, y X j . We can now modify our S, J, T system to obtain an S, J , T system in D by replacing Pj with the single path sjaaqrxbqrbsj 1 and adding the sk s1 path ska0yb0s1 see Figure 3 . If which is still guaranteed by . In both cases this contradicts the choice of our S, J, T system and completes the proof of Claim 4. Claim 5. Let a A and let A A be a set of size at least k0. Then N a A . Similarly, if b B and B B is a set of size at least k0 then N b B . Using Claim 4, this can be shown similarly as Claim 2. Let S A be the set of all those special vertices which send an edge to A and let S A be the set of all those special vertices which receive an edge from A. Define S B and S B similarly.

Chunk: SiC 000 1 . induced electron states overlapping with the conduction band see Fig. 2a . Given the delocalized nature of the interface state we expect the influence of Hubbard cor relations to be small. In contrast, at the C terminated substrate the electron state retains its localized charac ter, although it is smeared over a carbon ring just above the unsaturated C dangling bond. The localization fa vors the spin polarization and thus the splitting of the gap state, whereas the interface state at the Si face re mains spin degenerate. In the former case, Hubbard cor relations may lead to a further splitting of the interface state. Figures 2c and 2d show that the second carbon layer indeed possesses an electronic structure similar to free standing graphene. The characteristic conic point ap pears on the K line note that since the Brillouin zone corresponds to the 3 3R30 unit cell, the conic point is not located at the K point . The interface states of the buffer layer remain practically unchanged since the interaction of the carbon layers is very small. The metallic interface state on the Si terminated substrate pins the Fermi level just above the conic point, making the second graphene layer n doped. On C terminated substrate the Fermi level runs exactly through the conic point. Hence the interface is semimetallic just as for free standing graphene. Indeed, for a graphene covered C face Berger et al. found that the thin graphite layers possess electronic properties of free standing graphene. The parameters of the electron states for the different interfaces are summarized in Table I. For clean unre constructed surfaces we find work functions of 4.75 eV Si terminated surface and 5.75 eV C terminated sur face . The former value is practically the same as the work function of the reconstructed SiC . The first graphene layer reduces this value to 3.75 eV, which is 1.3 eV lower than the work function of free standing graphene. The drastic reduction of the work function is caused by charge flow from graphene to the interface region, which induces a dipole layer. On the C face the graphene overlayer also reduces the work function, but to a lesser extent such that it remains above the graphene value. Adding the second graphene layer makes the work function closer to that of graphene for both faces. The Fermi level pinning close to the conduction band makes the graphitized Si face especially suitable for Ohmic contacts on n type SiC, because it guarantees a low Schottky barrier. Indeed, Lu et al. find a very low resistance for thermally treated SiC contacts with 4 TABLE I Parameters of the unreconstructed and graphene covered SiC surfaces in eV work function , positions of the occupied and the unoccupied surface and interface states above the valence band edge Eo, Eu and their corresponding bandwidths Bo, Bu .

Recently Seyller et al. measured the Schot tky barrier between n type 6H SiC and graphite by photoelectron spectroscopy and found a low value of 0.3 eV . On the contrary, the C terminated face has the Fermi level close to the middle of the band gap and is semiconducting. The metallic interface state on the SiC 000 1 face makes the C terminated face suitable for Ohmic contacts to the SiC substrate. The interface states of the buffer layer remain practically unchanged since the interaction of the carbon layers is very small. The metallic interface state on the Si terminated substrate pins the Fermi level just above the conic point, making the second graphene layer n doped. On the C terminated substrate the Fermi level runs exactly through the conic point. The interface is semimetallic just as for free standing graphene.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0217v2 cs.IT 17 Feb 2009 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY, VOL. 55, NO. 3, MARCH 2009 1 Capacity of a Multiple Antenna Fading Channel With a Quantized Precoding Matrix Wiroonsak Santipach, Member, IEEE, and Michael L. Honig, Fellow, IEEE Abstract Given a multiple input multiple output MIMO channel, feedback from the receiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of Random Vector Quantization RVQ , in which the precoding ma trix is selected from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver, which relays the optimal rate maximizing precoder codebook index to the transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of beamforming rank one precoding matrix as a function of B, where large system refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go to infinity with fixed ratios. RVQ for beamforming is asymptotically optimal, i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error MMSE . Numerical examples show that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite size systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched filter can require significantly more feedback.

INTRODUCTION G IVEN a multi input multi output MIMO channel, pro viding channel information at the transmitter can in crease the achievable rate and simplify the coder and decoder.

Chunk: we just want to show some examples of these connections. More details can be found, e. g., in . We consider monadic logics on N with the relation , that is, first order logics where also unary finite value function variables and quantifiers over them are allowed. We also suppose that we know some fixed finite value function x N and can use it in our formulas. Such a theory is denoted by MT and is called monadic theory of x. The main question here can be the question of decidability, that is, does there exist an algorithm that given a sentence in a theory says whether this sentence is true of false. The criterion of decidability for monadic theories of almost periodic sequences can be formulated in terms of some their very natural characteristic, namely, almost periodicity regulator. An almost periodicity regulator of an almost periodic sequence x is a function f N N such that every factor u of x of length n occurs in each factor of x of length f n . So an almost periodicity regulator somehow regulates how periodic a sequence is. Notice that an almost periodicity regulator of a sequence is not unique every function greater than regulator is also a regulator. Theorem 2 Semenov 1983 . If x is almost periodic, then MT is decidable iffx and some its almost periodicity regulator are computable. The following result was obtained recently, but uses the technics already used in . Theorem 3 Carton, Thomas 2002 . If x is morphic, then MT is decidable. A curious result can be implied from two these theorems. Corollary 4. If x is both morphic and almost periodic, then some its regulator is computable. 7 Proof. Indeed, if x is morphic, then by Theorem 3 the theory MT is decidable. Since x is almost periodic, from Theorem 2 it follows that some almost periodicity regulator of x is computable. Notice that Corollary 4 does not imply the existence of an algorithm that given a morphic sequence computes some almost periodicity regulator of this sequence whenever it is almost periodic but probably this algorithm can be constructed after deep analyzing the proofs of Theorems 2 and 3 and showing uniformity in a sense . And it also does not imply the decidability of almost periodicity for morphic sequences. This decidability also does not imply Corollary 4. By the way, Corollary 4 allows us to hope that these algorithms exist. Though the formulation of this statement uses only combinatorics on words, the proof also involves the theory of monadic logics. Of course, it would be interesting to find a simple combinatorial proof of the result. And the last remark here is that Corollary 4 and its probable uniform version seems to be the best progress that we can obtain by this monadic approach. One could try to express in the monadic theory of morphic sequence which is decidable by Theorem 3 the property of almost periodicity, but it turns out to be impossible. 6 In General Case We have described two polynomial time algorithms, but without any precise bound for their working time. Of course, it can be done after deep analyzing of all the previous, but is probably not so interesting. It is not still known whether the problem of determining almost periodicity of arbitrary morphic sequence is decidable. Corollary 4 somehow supports the conjecture of decidability but even does not follow from this conjecture! . Theorem 7.5.1 from allows us to represent an arbitrary morphic sequence h s as g b where is non erasing. So it is sufficient to solve our main problem for h s with non erasing . It seems that the general problem is tightly connected with a particular case of h a where b 2 for each b A. There is no strict reduction to this case but solving problem in this case

Chunk: moment of inertia is , the value derived for standard equations of state for a neutron star Shapiro Teukolsky 1983 . Both of assumptions are standard in the literature e.g. Blondin et al. 2001 . The offset between the Clump 1, which as described in 3.2 is believed to be the location of the neu tron star powering the PWN, and the center of the radio emission is due to neutron star s spatial ve locity, vns. Using 2.1.1, we determine that this observed offset corresponds to physical distance of 6.6d17 pc. Since the observed offset is due only to the neutron star s velocity in the plane of the sky, it is a lower limit on the true distance the neu tron star has traveled since the SN explosion, rns. If we assume that , where tnow is the age of G328.4 0.2, the observed offset allows us to estimate the minimum spatial velocity of the neutron star, vmin ns , equal to vmin .6d17 pc tnow . Using Equation A19 , we determine that for stan dard initial periods P0 5 20 ms and magnetic field strengths 1011 1013 G , 0 varies from 100 2000 years. To cover this range, we assume that 0 of the neutron star in G328.4 0.2 can have one of three different values , 770, and 1730 years. which respectively correspond to a neutron star with 5 ms, 1012 G 9 and , or 1011 G and . This range of 0 is similar to those used by Blondin et al. , van der Swaluw et al. , and Bucciantini et al. . G328.4 0.2 is expanding into a uniform medium . This assumes G328.4 0.2 is much larger than either the main sequence and late stage wind bubble formed by its progenitor, both of which are ex pected to have an interior r 2 density struc ture. While the typical size of these structures is smaller than RG328, this is not the the case for very massive stars M 15 M for which these bubbles can reach sizes of 100 pc or larger in low density n 1 cm 3 environments Chevalier Emmering 1989 Chevalier Liang 1989 . In this case, our assumption of a constant density medium would not be correct. However, the effect of G328.4 0.2 still being inside a stellar wind bubble since this does not significantly mod ify the evolution of the SNR. Since their no a priori information on the density around G328.4 0.2, we assume it is one of the assume it has one of the following values log .5, 1.0, 0, 0.5 cm 3. which cover the range of densities in the warm ion ized medium and the warm neutral medium. The ejecta mass of the SN explosion that formed G328.4 0.2, Mej has one of the following values , 5, 10M and that the kinetic energy of the ejecta, Esn is log Esn 1051ergs 0.5, 0, 0.5. This range of Mej and Esn incorporate the range inferred from observations of normal SNe, but do not include hypernovae. We assume that the Lx E relationship used in 3.2 is accurate to better than two orders of mag nitude. As a result, in 4.1.1, we assume that the current spin down luminosity of the neutron star in G328.4 0.2 is one of the following .017, 0.17, 1.7, 17, and 170 1037 ergs s 1, and in 4.1.2 assume that 1.7 .7 1039 ergs s 1. These are the initial conditions used in both 4.1.1 and 4.1.2. The remaining input parameters into the model are the initial spin down luminosity E0 and space ve locity vns of the neutron star, and the method for deter mining the age of the SNR, tnow. In 4.1.1, we assume that E0 is 0 and vns is 0, and tnow is determined by assuming that the SNR is a supernova remnant ejecta, and the age of the supernova remnant is equal to the age of the SN explosion. In 4.1.2, we assume that E0 is 1040 ergs s 1, vns is 250 km s 1, and tnow is determined by assuming that the SNR is a supernova remnant ejecta, and the age of the supernova remnant is equal to the age of the SN explosion.

Chunk: .5 years. 4.1.1. G328.4 0.2 as a Composite SNR In this Section, we evaluate the possibility that G328.4 0.2 is a composite SNR. To do this, we first assume that the outer edge of the radio emission from this source denotes the edge of the SNR, and therefore RG328 Rsnr. As a result, for a given value of Esn, Mej, and n, we use the model for the evolution of a SNR discussed in Appendix A to calculate the current age of G328.4 0.2, tnow. With this value of tnow and assumed values for the current spin down luminosity of the neu tron star, E, and 0, we are able to calculate both the initial spin down luminosity E0 and initial period P0 of the neutron star in G328.4 0.2 using Eqs. A7 and A9 , respectively. Using this procedure, we ran our model using all pos sible combinations of the input parameters 0, E, Esn, Mej, and n given in 4.1, for a total of 540 different com binations. To see which combination of these input pa rameters provide a plausible explanation for G328.4 0.2, we require the following Criterion 1 vmin , since a neu tron star with a higher velocity than this is ex tremely implausible based on pulsar observations Hobbs et al. 2005 . Criterion 2 , the minimum rota tion period of a young proto neutron star before it breaks up Goussard et al. 1998 . Criterion 3 The PWN is smaller than the SNR for all . While it is possible that PWN could expand to fill the entire SNR, it is not con sidered likely, and is contrary to the model as sumption that the PWN does not affect the evolu tion of the SNR. Additionally, we also require that Rpwn tnow 0.67Rsnr tnow , due to the large ob served size of the flat spectral index radio emission which is produced from the PWN, as described in 3.2. Criterion 4 G328.4 0.2 is currently in the Free Expansion or Sedov Taylor phase of its expansion, i.e. , where trad, the age when a SNR goes radiative, is defined in Eq. A4. Once a SNR has entered its Radiative phase, it is expected that the radio emission from the SNR be confined to thin, bright, filaments like those observed in SNR G6.4 0.1 Mavromatakis et al. 2004 which are not observed in G328.4 0.2, or that the SNR is radio quiet. Criterion 5 The PWN RS collision has already occurred, as described in 3.2, and the PWN has been compressed as a result of its collision with the RS. This is required to explain the Central Bar, as described in 3.2. This requires that which can only occur at a time , the time when the PWN and RS collide. Criterion 6 The Central Bar created by the compression is still observable. This is satisfied if either the PWN is currently being compressed, vpwn tnow 0, or if the compression ended suffi ciently recently such that it can be observed. The Central Bar is believed to be formed by both a pressure and a magnetic field enhancement at the center of the PWN Bucciantini et al. 2003 . As a 10 result its observable lifetime is the synchrotron life time of electrons accelerated by the magnetic field enhancement. Therefore, we assume that the life time of the central bar is the synchrotron age of the accelerated electrons, synch, equal to 104 1 2B 3 2 pwn years, where is the observed frequency, in units of Hz, and Bpwn is the strength of the magnetic field in side of the PWN, in units of G. With this infor mation, in the case that vpwn tnow 0 we deter mine if the central bar is still observable by eval uating synch at 22 GHz since this is the highest frequency at which the Central Bar

Chunk: temperatures, especially if the X rays are from a PWN as argued by Hughes et al. . The derived parameters for the power law model are similar to that observed in other PWN e.g. Gotthelf 2003 , and agree well with the results obtained for G328.4 0.2 by Hughes et al. . There is no evidence for thermal X ray emission, which one would expect from a SNR, in this source. Since the individual regions discussed in 2.1.1 did not have enough counts for spectral fitting, we measured their hardness ratio HR , defined as higher energy band and S is the number of counts in the Soft lower energy band, of the regions discussed in 2.1.1 to determine if there were any spatial variations in the X ray spectrum of G328.4 0.2. Using the X ray spectrum as a guide, we calculate HR with H as the number of counts between 4 and 8 keV and S as the number of counts between 2 and 4 keV. Since the pixels on the pn detector are sufficiently large that it is not possible to separate the emission from these regions, we only use data from the mos1 and mos2 detectors. The calculated, background subtracted HR of G328.4 0.2 is 0.25 0.04, of the Clump 1 region is 0.29 0.07, of the Clump 2 region is 0.31 0.11, and of the diffuse region is 0.24 0.05 1 errors . As a result, we conclude that there is no significant change in the X ray spectrum of G328.4 0.2 between these features. 2.1.3. Timing Results A clear signature for the presence of a neutron star would be the detection of X ray pulsations in the emis sion from G328.4 0.2. We searched for this using the Z2 n test defined by Buccheri et al. , where n is the har monic number of periodic signal, for , 2, 3, 4. The maximum frequency searched was 2n t , the minimum frequency searched was 1 20 Hz, and the fre quency step was 1 4tobs 5 10 6 Hz, oversampling the Nyquist rate by a factor of 2 , where t is the time res olution of the dataset 5.7 ms and tobs is the length of the observation. We only used events from the pn in strument 5.7 ms since it was operated in Small Win dow Mode due to the poor time resolution 2.6s of the mos data. Additionally, we only used events from the Clump 1 region because only only emission from the central NS should be pulsed and as the brightest X ray region of G328.4 0.2, this region is the most probable location of any neutron star. Unfortunately, due to the large pixel size of the pn instrument this region is con taminated by emission from Clump 2 and the Diffuse re gion. The event times from the resultant event list were barycentered to the Solar System reference frame, and we searched for a periodicity over multiple energy ranges in order to maximize the sensitivity of our search. The most significant period detected was in the dataset which only included photons between 5 and 10 keV 159 photons , in which for 336 ms had Z2 .5 in 2074786 independent trials for this value of n and energy range, which has a 12 chance of being a false positive, result. Statistically, the most significant sinusoidal pulse was in the 1 20 keV dataset 340 photons , and had a period .1 ms with a Z2 .4 in 8365396 trials, a 34 chance of being a false positive. Assuming that this signal is not significant, we derive an upper limit on the pulse fraction of 45 for a sinusoidal pulse profile and 22.5 for a function pulse profile Leahy et al. 1983 . Using the pn count rate and size of the Clump 2 and Diffuse regions, 1 3

Chunk: 2 2Binc,T F 3 . 3. Results Figure 2 shows background subtracted 3 particle jet like correlation signals for dif ferent collisions and centralities. The pp and d Au results are similar with peaks clearly visible for the near side, 0,0 , away side, , , and the two cases of one particle on the near side and the other on the away side, 0, and ,0 . The away side peak displays on diagonal elongation which is consistent with kT broadening. Additional on diagonal elongation is present in the Au Au results, possibly due to deflected jets or large angle gluon radiation. The more central Au Au colli sions display an off diagonal structure, at about 1.45 radians, that is consistent with conical emission. This structure increases in magnitude with centrality and is prominent in the high statistics top 12 data provided by the online zero degree calorimeter ZDC trigger. Figure 3 shows away side projections of on diagonal strips to aT bT 2 and off diagonal strips to aT bT 2. In d Au collisions only a strong central peak is present for both on diagonal and off diagonal projections.

Chunk: observed by extrapolating synchrotron spectra up . The GRB rate as a function of intensity, the burst spectrum, and the LAT s effective area as a function of photon energy have been convolved to predict the LAT s burst detection rate see on the GRB rate per year . FIGURE 3. Distribution of z of Swift detected GRBs solid histogram and the empirical function dashes used in calculations. GRBs originate over a wide redshift range, and therefore we can expect the cutoff resulting from the Pop III era photon field to range over a wide energy range. As a result of a broad intrinsic energy distribution and possibly evolution, GRB fluence correlates poorly with z, and consequently GRBs that are bright in the LAT will not necessarily originate at lower z than dim LAT bursts. The z distribution of the bursts the LAT will detect is currently uncertain this distribution can be calculated assuming GRBs are correlated with other astrophysical phenomena e.g., the star formation rate , or can be estimated empirically. We use the observed distribution from the Swift mission Fig. 3 , which detects and rapidly localizes 100 GRBs per year . By convolving the LAT detection rate of bursts in which Ec can be observed, the relationship between Ec and z, and the z probability distribution, we estimate that the LAT will detect 7 GRBs year with observable Pop III era absorption cutoffs. The stronger case for absorption by Pop III era photons will result from determining Ec and z for the same burst. The fraction of LAT observed bursts for which redshifts will be determined is uncertain. The Swift mission is projected to last well into the GLAST era, and Swift should observe 1 6 of the bursts the LAT detects currently redshifts have been determined for 1 3 of the Swift bursts. GLAST will rapidly localize bursts onboard and on the ground, permitting follow up ground based observations that might result in burst redshifts however, the localization by GLAST s GBM degrees and LAT tenths of a degree detectors may be too large to result in many redshifts. In addition, various relations between burst characteristics have been proposed that could turn bursts into standard candles. For example, a tight relationship between the burst s peak luminosity, a measure of its duration, and the average photon energy has been found . The two GLAST instruments will observe the burst lightcurve from which the duration can be measured and spectrum from which the average photon energy can be measured . The predicted ratio between the observed peak flux and the peak luminosity gives an estimate of the redshift that is akin to a photometric redshift. Thus we estimate that enough bursts with LAT determined cutoffs will have redshifts enabling robust determination of the Pop III era spectral absorption over the course of the GLAST mission.

Chunk: modulations of the continuum and line emission see Fig. 5 would suggest the presence of a local ized co rotating flare above the accretion disc which irradiates a small spot on its surface. The intensity modulations we see Fig. 5 would then be produced by Doppler beaming effects acting on both the flare and spot emission, i.e. on both contin uum and line and the characteristic time scale of 27 ks would be identified with the orbital period because of gravitational time dilation, the period measured by an observer on the disc at 10 rg would be shorter by 10 . As demonstrated above, a flare spot system orbiting the black hole at 10 rg would also produce a time averaged line profile in agreement with the ob servations. However, such a model makes definite prediction on the Fe line energy modulation within one orbital period. In this framework, the orbiting spot on the accretion disc would also give rise to energy modulations of the Fe line due to the Doppler effect and such energy modulation is barely seen in the data see Fig. 3 . We stress that the adopted time resolu tion 2.5 ks is good enough to detect energy modulations with a characteristic 27 ks time scale. This has been demonstrated with XMM Newton in the case of NGC 3516, where the modu lation occurs on a very similar time scale Iwasawa et al. 2004 F. Tombesi et al. Correlated modulation between the redshifted Fe K line and the continuum emission in NGC 3783 7 see also Dov ciak et al. 2004 for theoretical models . Therefore, the lack of Fe line energy modulation disfavours the orbiting flare spot interpretation for NGC 3783. However, a variability time scale of the order of the orbital one at a given radius does not necessarily imply the motion of a point like X ray source. In fact, since the orbital time scale is the fastest at a given disc radius, and since the observed time scale of 27 ks corresponds to the orbital period at 10 rg, one could argue that the data only imply that the X ray variability likely originates from within 10 rg. The apparent recurrence in the X ray continuum modulation may not necessarily be re lated to a real physical periodicity, especially considering the limited length of the observation only four putative cycles are detected . A possible explanation for the observed behaviour is that the X ray continuum source s located within 10 rg from the center irradiates the whole accretion disc, but only a ring like structure around 10 rg is responsible for the fluorescent Fe emission. This is possible if the bulk of the accretion disc is so highly ionized that little Fe line is produced, while an over dense and therefore lower ionization structure is responsible for the fluorescent emission. Such an over dense region could have an approximate ring like geometry if it is for instance as sociated with a spiral wave density perturbation. In this case, the Fe emitting region is extended in the azimuthal direction and we do not expect strong energy modulation with time, whatever the origin of the continuum modulation. We point out that spiral density distributions could result from the ordered magnetic fields in the inner region of the disc and that the en ergy dissipation via e.g. magnetic reconnection could be en hanced there, thereby providing a common site for the produc tion of the X ray continuum and the Fe line e.g. Machida Matsumoto 2003 . On the other hand, if the apparent recurrence is in fact real, it is worth noting that the continuous theoretical effort in understanding the origin of quasi periodic oscillations QPO in neutron star and black hole systems provides a wealth of mechanisms inducing quasi periodic variability, although none is firmly established Psaltis 2001 Kato 2001 Rezzolla et

Chunk: al. 2003 Lee et al. 2004 Zycki Sobolewska 2005 and many others . A connection between QPO phase and Fe line inten sity has been previously claimed in the Galactic black hole GRS 1915 105 Miller Homan 2005 . Although in our case, the presence of a QPO cannot be claimed because of the very small number of detected cycles, the analogy is suggestive. In the case of GRS 1915 105, Miller Homan consider that a warp in the inner disc, possibly due to Lense Thirring preces sion, may produce the observed QPO Fe line connection e.g. Markovic Lamb 1998 . However, to produce the observed 15 rms variability in the X ray lightcurve, the black hole spin axis should be inclined with respect to the line of sight by at least 60 which is at odds with our inclination estimate of 11 4 and with the Seyfert 1 nature of NGC 3783 , and the tilt precession angle should be larger than 20 30 Schnittman, Homan, Miller 2006 . Both requirements make it highly un likely that Lense Thirring precession can successfully account for the observed modulations in NGC 3783. While the origin of the coherent intensity modulation still remains unclear, the correlated variation of the continuum and line emission and the Fe line shape are consistent with an emis sion site at 10 rg. Moreover, the fact that the iron line variabil ity responds to the 27 ks time scale modulation only implies that this short time scale variation is somehow detached from the long term variability. The latter may be associated with per turbations in the accretion disc propagating inwards from outer radii and modulating the X ray emitting region Lyubarskii 1997 , while the former seems to genuinely originate in the inner disc. Further observational data may help to clarify the complex phenomena related to the relativistic Fe line temporal evolu tion in Seyfert 1 galaxies. Our work makes it clear that higher quality data in the Fe band will be able to probe the inner most regions of accretion flows with high accuracy. Next gen eration of large collecting area X ray missions such as XEUS and Constellation X or even very long observations with XMM Newton will be crucial to fully exploit such potential.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0228v1 gr qc 2 Apr 2007 epl draft Einstein vs Maxwell Is gravitation a curvature of space, a field in flat space, or both? Theo M. Nieuwenhuizen Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Amsterdam, Valckenierstraat 65, 1018 XE Amsterdam, The Netherlands PACS 04.20.Cv Fundamental problems and general formalism PACS 04.20.Fy Canonical formalism, Lagrangians, and variational principles PACS 98.80.Bp Origin and formation of the Universe Abstract. Starting with a field theoretic approach in Minkowski space, the gravitational energy momentum tensor is derived from the Einstein equations in a straightforward manner. This allows to present them as acceleration . total energy momentum tensor. For flat space cosmology the gravitational energy is negative and cancels the material energy. In the relativistic theory of gravitation a bimetric coupling between the Riemann and Minkowski metrics breaks general coordinate invariance. The case of a positive cosmological constant is considered. A singularity free version of the Schwarzschild black hole is solved analytically. In the interior the components of the metric tensor quickly die out, but do not change sign, leaving the role of time as usual. For cosmology the CDM model is covered, while there appears a form of inflation at early times. Here both the total energy and the zero point energy vanish. It is said that in introducing the general theory of rela tivity GTR , Einstein made the step that Lorentz and Poincar e had failed to make to go from flat space to curved space. Technically, this arises from the group of general coordinate transformations . One fundamen tal difficulty is then how to deal with the physics of gravi tation itself, since there is only a quasi energy momentum tensor . For gravitational wave detection, e.g., this leaves open the question as to how energy can be faithfully transferred from the wave to the detector. The proper en ergy momentum tensor of gravitation was derived only recently by Babak and Grishchuk , who start with a field theoretic approach to gravitation, in terms of a ten sor field h in a Minkowski background space time. The metric of the latter, diag 1, 1, 1, 1 , is denoted in arbitrary coordinates by 1. The Riemann metric tensor g g 1, is then defined by rg g h k , g det g det . It is just a way to code the gravitational field, allowing to expresses distances by dx dx . Such a non linear way to code distances in a flat space is not uncom mon. For diffuse light transport through clouds, one may express distances in the optical thickness, the number of extinction lengths. If the cloud is not homogeneous, points at the same physical distance are described by a different optical distance and, vice versa. The Maxwell view that gravitation is a field in flat space, was actually the starting point for Einstein, and reappeared regularly. Nathan Rosen , coauthor of the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paper that led the basis for quantum information, considers a bimetric theory, in volving the Minkowski metric and the Riemann metric. Bimetrism is quite natural, with entering e.g. particle physics, and g e.g. cosmology. Rosen considers covari ant derivatives D of Minkowski space, with Christoffel symbols vanishing in Cartesian coordinates. When re placing in the Riemann Christoffel symbols partial deriva tives by Minkowski covariant ones, 1 2g g g g 7 G 1 2g D g D g D g , the obtained Christoffel type symbols G are tensors in Minkowski space. Inspired by the Landau Lifshitz and Babak Grishchuk results, we may define the acceleration tensor A 1 2D D k k k k , where k h and in which the terms do not p 1 Th.M. Nieuwenhuizen contribute. Then we can calculate the combination c4 8 G g A R 1 2g R . In doing so, we make use of Rosen s observation that R remain unchanged if

Chunk: Lie algebra of H. This too implies SH for arbitrary classical type. For types B, C, D, the constant above is 2. Experimental evidence for this hypothesis is given in Section 6.1. 15 The analogue of the PH3, even in the more general q setting, is known to hold for the generating function of the Kostant partition function of type A, and more generally, for a parabolic Kostant partition function cf. Kirillov Ki . This also gives a support for the PH3 above, given a close relationship between Littlewood Richardson coefficients and Kostant partition functions FH . 1.3 Back to the general decision problems It may be remarked that the Littlewood Richardson problem actually never arises in the flip. It is only used as a simplest proptotype of the actual much harder problems that arise namely relaxed forms of Problems 1.1.1 1.1.4. Now we turn to these problems. The goal is to generalize the preced ing results and hypotheses for the Littlewood Richardson coefficients to the structural constants that arise in these problems. The problem of finding a positive, combinatorial formula for the plethysm constant Problem 1.1.2 , akin to the positive Littlewood Richardson rule, has already been recog nized as an outstanding, classical problem in representation theory St4 the known formulae based on character theory mentioned in Section 1.1 are not positive, because they involve alternating signs. Indeed, existence of such a formula is a part of the first positivity hypothesis PH1 below for the plethysm constant, and this problem is the main focus of the work in GCT4, GCT7, GCT8, GCT9 . In view of the intensive work on the plethym constant in the literature, it has now become clear that the com plexity of the plethysm problem Problem 1.1.2 is far higher than that of the Littlewood Richardson problem Problem 1.2.1 . This gap in the com plexity is the main source of difficulties that has to be addressed. We now state the main ingradients in the plan in this paper to show that the relaxed forms of Problems 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, and 1.1.4, with , belong to P. 1.4 Saturated and positive integer programming First, we formulate a general algorithmic paradigm of saturated and positive integer programming that can be applied in the context of these problems. Let A be an m n integer matrix, and b an integral m vector. An integer programming problem asks if the polytope P Ax b contains an integer 16 point. In general, it is NP complete. We want to define its relaxed version, which will turn out to have a polynomial time algorithm. We allow m, the number of constraints, to be exponential in n. Hence, we cannot assume that A and b are explicitly specified. Rather, it is assumed that the polytope P is specified in the form of a polynomial time separation oracle in the spirit of Gr otschel, Lov asz and Schrijver GLS cf. Section 2.3. Given a point x Rn, the separation oracle tells if x P, and if not, gives a hyperplane that separates x from P. Let fP n be the Ehrhart quasi polynomial of P St1 . By definition, fP n is the number of integer points in the dilated polytope nP. An integer programming problem is called saturated, if 1. The specification of P also contains a number sie P , called the sat uration index estimate, with the guarantee that the saturation in dex s fP sie P cf. Definition 1.2.4. In particular, this means fP n sie P is strictly saturated. 2. the goal of the problem is to give an efficient algorithm to decide if, given an integral relaxation parameter P , if cP contains an integer point. The algorithm has to work only for relaxation parameters P . In particular, if sie P 1, the algorithm problem does not have to determine if P contains an integer

Chunk: 7 the meaning of the term explicit is also given there. b The problem of deciding existence of a geometric obstruction also belongs to P, assuming a stronger form of PH1 specified in Chapter 7. Here geomet ric obstruction is a simpler type of robust obstruction, defined in Chapter 7, which is conjectured to exist in the lower bound problems under considera tion. For a precise statement of this theorem, see Chapter 7. This theorem needs only PH1, but not SH, which is only needed to argue why robust obstructions should exist Section 7.6.6 , and furthermore, it is only needed for Problems 1.1.1 1.1.3 and not for the GIT Problem 1.1.4. Thus PH1 is the main positivity hypothesis of GCT in the context proving existence of robust obstructions for the lower bound problems under consideration. A basic plan for implementing the flip suggested by the considerations above is summarized in Figure 1.3. It is an elaboration of Figure 1.1. Ques tion marks in the figure indicate open problems. 1.9 Organization of the paper The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 30 Negative hypotheses in complexity theory Lower bound problems The flip Positive hypotheses in complexity theory Upper bound problems Saturated and positive integer programming, and the quasi polynomiality results in this paper Mathematical saturation and positivity hypotheses PH1,SH PH2,3 Construction of the canonical models in this paper, and construction of the quantum groups in GCT4,7 ?? PH0 Construction of quantizations of the coordinate rings of the canonical models and their canonical bases ?? ? Problems related to the Riemann Hypothesis over finite fields, and their generalizations Figure 1.3 A basic plan for implementing the flip 31 In Chapter 2 we describe the basic complexity theoretic notions that we need in this paper and describe their significance in the context of represen tation theory. In Chapter 3, we give a polynomial time algorithm for saturated integer programming Theorem 1.4.1 , and give precise statements of the results and positivity hypotheses for Problems 1.1.3 and 1.1.4 with mentioned in Section 1.5. These generalize the ones given in Section 1.6 for the plethysm constant. The framework of saturated in teger programming in this paper may be applicable to many other struc tural constants in representation theory and algebraic geometry, such as the Kazhdan Lusztig polynomials cf. Sections 3.7 . In Chapter 4, we prove the basic quasi polynomiality results Theorem 1.6.1 and its generalizations for Problems 1.1.3 and 1.1.4. We also define canonical models for the structural constants under consideration, and briefly describe the relevance of the nonstandard quantum groups and the related results in GCT4, GCT7, GCT8 in the context of quantizing the coordinate rings of these canonical models and extending PH0 to them Figure 1.2 . In Chapter 5, we prove the basic PSPACE results Theorem 1.6.3 and its extensions for the various cases of Problem 1.1.3. In Chapter 6, we give experimental evidence for the positivity hypotheses PH2 and PH3 in some special cases of the Problems 1.1.1 1.1.4. In Chapter 7, we describe an application Theorem 1.8.1 of the re sults and positivity hypotheses in this paper to the problem of verifying or discovering a robust obstruction, i.e., a proof of hardness GCT2 in the context of the P vs. NP and the permanent vs. determinant problems in characteristic zero. 1.10 Notation We let denote the total bitlength of the specification of X. Here X can be an integer, a partition, a classifying label of an irreducible representation of a reductive group, a polytope, and so on. The exact meaning of will be clear from the context. The notation poly n means O na , for some constant a. The notation poly n1, n2, . . . similarly means bounded by a polynomial of a constant degree in n1, n2, . . .. Given a reductive group H, V H denotes the irreducible representation of H

Chunk: the relationship of the Hecke algebra with the Drinfeld Jimbo quantum group. The article GCT8 gives conjecturally correct algorithms to con struct canonical bases of the matrix coordinate rings of the nonstandard quantum groups and of nonstandard algebras that have conjectural posi tivity properties analogous to those of the canonical global crystal bases, as per Kashiwara and Lusztig, of the coordinate ring of the Drinfeld Jimbo quantum group, and the Kazhdan Lusztig basis of the Hecke algebra. These positivity conjectures hypotheses lie at the heart of this approach.

Chunk: index is O poly P . Conjecturally, this also holds for the positivity index. This estimate is very conservative, but useful when no better estimate is available. Proof There exists a triangulation of P into simplices such that every vertex of any simplex is also a vertex of P. Then fP n X f n , where ranges over all open simplices in this triangulation a zero dimensional open simplex is a vertex. The saturation index of fP n is clearly bounded by the maximum of the saturation indices of f n . Hence, we can assume, without loss of generality, that P is an open sim plex. Let v0, . . . , vn be its vertices. Then, by Ehrhart s result cf. Theorem 1.3 in st5 , FP t P i hiti Qn 1 taj , where , hi s are nonnegative, and aj is the least positive integer such that ajvj is integral. By Cramer s rule, the bit length of each aj is poly P . Without loss of generality, we can also assume that aj s are relatively prime. Otherwise, the estimate on the saturation index below has to be multiplied by the g.c.d. of aj s. Then the result follows by applying the following lemma to FP t , poly P . Q.E.D. 45 Lemma 3.1.6 Let f n be a quasipolynomial whose generating function F t has a positive form F t P i hiti Qn 1 taj , where , hi s are nonnegative, and aj s are positive and relatively prime. Let . Then the saturation index s f of f n is O poly a, n . Proof Let g n be the quasi polynomial whose generating function G t P g n tn is 1 Qn 1 taj . It is known that this is the Ehrhart quasipoly nomial of the polytope N a0, . . . , an defined by the linear system X , . The saturation index s g of g n is bounded by the Frobenius number associated with the set of integers this is the largest positive integer m such that the diophantine equation X j x0, . . . , xn . It is known e.g. BDR that the Frobenius number is bounded by X j aj p a0a1a2 a0 a1 a2 O poly a , assumming that a0 a1 . . .. Hence, s g O poly a . Since f n is a quasi polynomial, the degree of the numerator of F t is less than the degree of the denominator. Thus the maximum value of i that occurs in is an. Let gi n , i an, be the quasi polynomial whose generating function is ti Qn 1 taj . Then s gi i s g O poly a, n . Since, hi s in are nonnegative, s f max s gi . The result follows. Q.E.D. 46 3.1.2 Extensions We now mention a few straightforard extensions of Theorem 3.1.1. First, it is not necessary that P be a closed polytope. We can allow it to be half closed. Specifically, it can be a solution set of a system of inequalitites of the form A1x b1 and , where we have allowed strict inequalities. The function FP n nP , the number of integer points in nP, is again a quasi polynomial. Hence, the notions of saturation and positivity can be generalized to this setting in a natural way. Second, the algorithm in Theorem 3.1.1 b only needs a nonnegative number s P such that, for any positive integer P Saturation guarantee If the affine span of cP, contains an integer point, then cP is guaranteed to contain an integer point. If s P sie P , then this guarantee holds, as can be seen from the proof of Theorem 3.1.1. 3.1.3 Is there a simpler algorithm? Though the algorithm

Chunk: for saturated integer programming in Theorem 3.1.1 is conceptually very simple, in reality it is quite intricate, because the work of Gr otschel, Lov asz and Schrijver GLS needs a delicate extension of the el lipsoid algorithm Kh and the polynomial time algorithm for basis reduction in lattices due to Lenstra, Lenstra and Lov asz LLL . As has been empha sized in GLS , such a polynomial time algorithm should only be taken as a proof of existence of an efficient algorithm for the problem under consider ation. It may be conjectured that for the problems under consideration in this paper such simple, combinatorial algorithms exist. But for the design of such algorithms, saturation alone does not suffice. The stronger property PH3 , and more, is necessary. We shall address this issue in Section 3.6. 3.2 Littlewood Richardson coefficients again Theorem 3.1.4 applied to the BZ polytope BZ , with saturation index esti mate equal to zero, specializes to the following in the setting of the Littlewood 47 Richardson problem Problem 1.2.1 Theorem 3.2.1 GCT5 Assuming SH Hypothesis 1.2.5 , nonvanishing of c , , given , , , can be decided in strongly polynomial time Section 2.1 for any semisimple classical Lie algebra G. It is assumed here that , , are specified by their coordinates in the basis of fundamental weights. For type A, this reduces to the result in GCT3 , which holds unconditionly. The saturation conjecture for type A arose Z in the context of Horn s conjecture and the related result of Klyachko Kl . We now turn to implica tions of Theorem 3.2.1 in this context. Given a complex, semisimple, simply connected, classical group G, let LR G be the Littlewood Richardson semigroup as in Section 2.2.2. The following is a natural generalization of the problem raised by Zelevinsky Z to this general setting Problem 3.2.2 Give an efficient description of LR G . Zelevinsky asks for a mathematically explicit description. This is a com puter scientist s variant of his problem. Let LRR G be the polyhedral convex cone generated by LR G . For C , by the saturation theorem, a triple , , of dominant weights belongs to LR G iffit belongs to LRR G . Assuming SH Hy pothesis 1.2.5 , Theorem 3.2.1 provides the following efficient description for LR G in general. Recall that the period of the Littlewood Richardson stretching polynomial c , n divides a fixed constant d G , which only de pends on the types of simple factors of G DM2, GCT5 . Let i s denote the coordinates of in the basis of fundamental weights. Corollary 3.2.3 a Assuming SH, whether a given , , belongs to LR G can be determined in strongly polynomial time. b There exists a decomposition of LRR G into a set of polyhedral cones, which form a cell complex C G , and, for each chamber C in this complex, a set M C of O rank G 2 modular equations, each of the form X i ai i X i bi i X i ci mod d , for some d dividing d G , such that 48 1.

If so, the cone C , , and the associated set M C , of modular equa tions can also be determined in strongly polynomial time. After this, whether , , satisfies the equations in M C , can be trivially determined in strongly polynomial time. Proof a is a consequence of Theorem

Chunk: representation V H of H occurs in the irreducible repre sentation V G of G with nonzero multiplicity. Then T H, G is a finitely generated semigroup with respect to addition. This is proved in Section 4.4. PSPACE The following is a generalization of Theorem 1.6.3. Theorem 3.4.3 Assume that H in Problem 1.1.3 is a direct product, whose each factor is a complex simple, simply connected Lie group, or an alternat ing or symmetric group, or SLn Fpk or GLn Fpk , or a torus. Then f x m can be computed in poly space, with x as specified above. This is proved in Chapter 5. It may be conjectured that Theorem 3.4.3 holds even when the composition factors of H are allowed to be general finite simple groups of Lie type. This will be so if Lusztig s algorithm Lu5 for computing the characters of finite simple groups of Lie type can be parallelized cf. Section 5.4. Positivity hypotheses Theorem 3.4.1 3.4.3, along with the experimental results in special cases cf. Chapter 6 , constitute the main evidence in support of the positivity Hypotheses 3.3.1 3.3.4 for the subgroup restrition problem. 3.5 The decision problem in geometric invariant theory Finally, let us turn to the most general Problem 1.1.4. 58 3.5.1 Reduction from Problem 1.1.3 to Problem 1.1.4 First, let us note that the subgroup restriction problem Problem 1.1.3 is a special case of Problem 1.1.4. To see this, let H, and G be as in Problem 1.1.3, and let X be the closed G orbit of the point v corresponding to the highest weight vector of V G in the projective space P V G . Then G P , where the Gv is the parabolic stabilizer of v . We have a natural action of H on X via . Let R be the homogeneous coordinate ring of X. By Ha, MR, Rm, Sm , the singularities of spec R are rational. By Borel Weil FH , the degree one component R1 of the homogeneous coordinate ring R of X is V G . Hence, s 1 in this special case of Problem 1.1.4 is precisely m in Problem 1.1.3. The results in Section 3.4 for s 1 generalize in a natural way for s d. 3.5.2 Input specification The variety X in the above example is completely specified by H, and . Hence its specification X can be given in the form a tuple H , , , where H , and are the specifications of H, and as in Section 3.4, The input specification x for Problem 1.1.4 in the special case above is the tuple X , d, H , , , d, , where is the specification of as in Section 3.4. We now describe a class of varieties X which have similar compact spec ifications. Let G be a connected, reductive group, H a reductive, possibly discon nected, reductive group, and H G an explicit polynomial homomor phism as in Section 3.4. Let G be an irreducible representation of G for a dominant weight . Let P V be the projective space associated with V . It has a natural action of H via . Let v P V be a point that is char acterized by its stabilizer Gv G. This means it is the only point in P V that is stabilized by Gv. For example, the point v above is characterized by its parabolic stabilier. We assume that we know the Levi decompositioon of Gv explicity, and its compact specification Gv , like that of H, and also an explicit compact specification of the embedding Gv G, aking to that of the explicit homomorphism H G. Let X P V be the projective closure of the G orbit of v in P V . Then X as well as the action of H on X are completely specified

Chunk: polytope can have nonintegral vertices DM1 . Remark 4.2.5 c , need not be generated by its degree one compo nent T1. If this were always so, the h vector hd, , h0 in eq. would be an M vector Macauley vector St2 . But one can construct , and for which this does not hold. Proof of the proposition Since T is integral over T1, it has an h.s.o.p., all of whose elements have degree 1. By Theorem 3.4.1, the singularities of spec T are rational. Hence T is Cohen Macaulay. Now the result immediately follows from the theory of Cohen Macauley rings St2 . Q.E.D. In view of this Proposition, the conjecture of King et al will follow if all canonical basis elements of T c , can be shown to be integral over the basis elements of degree one. This requires a further study of the multiplicative structure of this canonical basis. Considerations for PH3 Hypothesis 1.2.8 for Littlewood Richardson coefficients of arbitrary type are similar. PH2 Similarly, the positivity property PH2 of the stretching quasipolynomial associated with Littlewood Richardson coefficients may possibly follow from a deep study of the multiplicative structure of the canonical basis as per PH0 Proposition 4.2.1 , just as positivity of the multiplicative structural coefficients of the canonical basis for the negative part of the Drinfeld Jimbo enveloping algebra follows from a deep study of the multiplicative structure of this basis Lu4 . 4.2.2 On PH0 in general The discussion above indicates that for Littlewood Richardson coefficients PH1,SH,PH3, and plausibly PH2 as well are intimately related to PH0 Proposition 4.2.1 . This leads us to ask if the rings associated in Sec tion 4.1.2 with other structural constants under consideration in this paper 72 have quantizations which satisfy appropriate forms of PH0. If so, this PH0 may be used to derive PH1, SH, PH3, and PH2 Hypotheses 3.3.1 3.3.4 for these structural constants. Note that SH a follows from PH3 see the remark after Hypothesis 3.3.4 PH2 may also follow from PH3. Thus PH1 and PH3 are the ones to focus on. To formalize this, let s be a structural constant which is either the Kro necker coefficient as in Problem 1.1.1, or the plethysm constant as in Prob lem 1.1.2, or the multiplicity m in Problem 1.1.3, or the multiplicity s d, as in Problem 1.1.4, when X therein is a class variety. Let R s , S s , T s be the rings associated with s Section 4.1.2 . Let X s Proj R s , Y s Proj S s and Z s Proj R s . We call s , s , s the canonical rings associated with s, and X s , Y s , Z s the canonical models associated with s, because we expect these rings and models to be special as in the case of the Littlewood Richardson coefficients. Let H be as in Problem 1.1.3 or Problem 1.1.4. Assume that H is connected. Let Hq denote the Drifeld Jimbo quantization of H. Now we ask Question 4.2.6 PH0?? Are there quatizations Rq, Sq of R, S, with Hq action, and a quantization Tq of T with canonical bases in some appro priate sense B Rq , B Sq , B Tq , where B Rq and B Sq are compatible with the Hq action and B Sq is an extension of B Tq ? Furthermore, do these canonical bases have appropriate positivity properties? In other words, are there quantizations of R, S and T for which PH0 Proposition 4.2.1 can be extended in a natural way? If so, this extended PH0 may be used to prove PH1 and SH for s just as in the case of Littlewood Richardson coefficients of type A . 4.3 Nonstandard quantum group for the Kronecker and the plethysm problems We now consider this question when s

Queries:
1. What is the relationship between polytope vertices, degree one components, and Macaulay vectors in the context of Remark 4.2.5 c?
2. How can one construct examples where the conditions in the mentioned proposition do not hold?
3. What further study of the multiplicative structure of the canonical basis is required to prove the conjecture of King et al?

Answers:
1. The relationship between polytope vertices, degree one components, and Macaulay vectors in the context of Remark 4.2.5 c is that the polytope need not be generated by its degree one component, and this does not necessarily result in an M vector or a Macaulay vector.
2. One can construct examples that do not meet the conditions in the proposition by considering cases where the ring is not Cohen-Macaulay or where the singularities are not rational.
3. Further study of the multiplicative structure of the canonical basis is required to prove the conjecture of King et al. This includes understanding the relationship between the canonical basis elements and their degree one components, as well as considering the multiplicative structure of the canonical basis for other types of coefficients.

Chunk: of Theorem 5.1.3 Let , , be as in Theorem 5.1.3. Let C , H , V . Let s x1, . . . , xm be the formal character of the representation V G of G. Here V can be exponential in n and . The basis of V H is indexed by semistandard tableau of shape with entries in 1, n . Let us order these tableau, say lexicographically, and let Ti, 1 i m, denote the i th tableau in this order. With each tableau T, we associate a monomial t T n Y T i , where wi T denotes the number of i s in T. Given a polynomial f x1, . . . , xm , let us define f f t1, . . . , tn to be the polynomial obtained by substi tuting Ti in f x1, . . . , xm . Then the formal character of V G , considered as an H representation of via the homomorphism H V H , is the symmetric polynomial S , t1, . . . , tn S . The plethysm constant a , is defined by S , t1, . . . , tn X a , S t1, . . . , tn . An efficient parallel algorithm to compute a , is as follows. Here by an efficient parallel algorithm, we mean an algorithm that works in poly , , time using 2poly , , processors. We will repeatedly use Proposi tion 5.0.3. Algorithm Compute S , t1, . . . , tn . By the Weyl character formula , S , t1, . . . , tn A , t1, . . . , tn B , t1, . . . , tn , where A x1, . . . , xm and B x1, . . . , xm denote the numerator and denom inator in , and A , A , and B , B . Let t1, . . . , tn . Then A , t1, . . . , tn t Tj i m i . This is the determinant of an m m matrix with entries in R, where V can be exponential in n and . It can be evaluated in O log2 m parallel ring operations using poly m processors. Each ring element that arises in the course of this algorithm is a polynomial in t1, . . . , tn of total degree O m , where denotes the size of . The total number of its coefficients is m n . Hence each ring operation can be carried out efficiently in O log2 r parallel time using poly r processors. Since log n, and log n, , , it follows that A , can be evaluated in poly n, , parallel time using 2poly n, processors. The determinant B , can also be computed efficiently in parallel in a similar fashion. To compute S , , we have to divide A , by B , . This can be done by solving an r r linear system, which, again, can be done efficiently in parallel. This computation yields representation of S , in the monomial basis of the ring of symmetric polynomials in t1, . . . , tn. To get the coefficients a , , we have to get the representation of S , t in the Schur basis. This change of basis requires inversion of the matrix in the linear system . The entries of the matrix K occuring in this 88 linear system are Kostka numbers. Each Kostka number can be computed efficiently in parallel. Hence, all entries of this matrix can be computed efficiently in parallel. After this, the matrix can be inverted efficiently in parallel, and the coefficients a , s of S , in the Schur basis can be computed efficiently in parallel.

Chunk: Furthermore, a positive integral relaxation parameter k such that Vk G is a strong obstruction can also be found in the same time. The crucial result used implicitly here is the quasipolynomiality theorem Theorem 4.1.1 because of which PH1 for both s d and md are well defined. Proof By linear programming GLS , whether Qd is nonempty or not can be determined in poly Qd poly , , , , time. If it is nonempty, the linear programming algorithm also gives its affine span. Whether this contains an integer point can be determined in polynomial time, using the polynomial time algorithm for computing the Smith normal form, as in the proof of Theorem 3.1.1. Similarly, whether P d is nonempty or not can be determined in poly P d poly , , time. If it is nonempty, whether its affine span contains an integer point can be determined in polynomial time similarly. Further more, the algorithm can also be made to return a vertex v of the polytope P d if it is nonempty. Using these observations, whether V G is a robust obstruction can be determined in polynomial time. As far as the computation of the relaxation parameter k is concerned, let us consider the second case in Definition 7.4.1 when both Qd and P d are nonempty, the affine span of Qd does not contain an integer point and the affine span of P d contains an integer point the first case being simpler. In this case, by examining the Smith normal forms of the defining equations of the affine spans of P d and Qd and the rational coordinates of a vertex v P d , we can find a large enough k so that the affine span of Qkd k does not contain an integer point, the affine span of P k kd contains an integer point, and P k kd contains an integer point that is some multiple of v. Q.E.D. The value of the relaxation parameter k computed above is rather con servative. One may wish to compute as small value of k as possible for which Vk G is a strong obstruction though in our application this is not necessary . If SH for holds for the structural constant s d cf. Hypothe sis 3.3.2 and Section 3.5 , then we can let k be the smallest integer larger 116 than the saturation index estimate for P d such that affine span of Qkd k if nonempty does not contain an integer point as can be ensured by looking at the Smith normal of the defining equations of the affine span . 7.6 Arithemetic version of the P P vs. NC prob lem in characteristric zero We now specialize the discussion in the preceding sections in the context of the arithmetic form of the P P vs. NC problem in characteristric zero V . In concrete terms, the problem is to show that the permanent of an n n complex matrix X cannot be expressed as a determinant of an m m complex matrix, whose entries are possibly nonhomogeneous linear com binations of the entries of X. 7.6.1 Class varieties The class varieties in this context are as follows GCT1 . Let Y be an m m variable matrix, which can also be thought of as a variable l vector, . Let X be its, say, principal bottom right n n submatrix, , which can be thought of as a variable k vector, . Let Y be the space of homogeneous forms of degree m in the variable entries of Y . The space V , and hence P V , has a natural action of Y GLl C given by f Y f 1Y , for any f V , G, and thinking of Y as an l vector. Let X be the space of homogeneous forms of degree n in

Chunk: the variable entries of X. The space W, and also P W , has a similar action of X GLk C . We use any entry y of Y not in X as the homogenizing variable for embedding W in V via the map W V defined by h Y ym nh X , for any h X W. We also think of as a map from P W to P V . Let Y P V be the determinant form, and h , where X P W . Let V g , V f P V be the projective closures of the orbits Gg and Gf, respectively, in P V . Let W h P W be the projective closure of the K orbit Kh of h in P W . Then V g is called the class variety associated with NC and V f the class variety associated with 117 P P W h is called the base class variety associated with P P . The base class variety is not used in what follows. Rather its variant, called a reduced class variety defined below, will be used. These class varieties depend on the lower bound parameters n and m. If we wish to make these explicit, we would write V f, n, m and V g, m instead of V f and V g . The class varieties V g V g, m and V f V f, n, m are G subvarieties of P V , and their homogeneous coordinate rings RV g RV g, m and RV f RV f, n, m have natural degree preserving G action. It is conjectured in GCT1 that, if n and n , then f V g this is equivalent to saying that the class variety V f, n, m cannot be embedded in the class variety V g, m as a subvariety . This implies the arithmetic form of the P P NC conjecture in characteristic zero. 7.6.2 Obstructions The obstruction in this context is defined as follows. A G module V G is called an obstruction for the pair f, g if it occurs in RV f, n, m d but not RV g, m d for some d. It is called a strong obstruction if, for some d, it occurs in RV f, n, m d but it does not contain Cg d as a Gg submodule, where Cg V denotes the one dimensional line corresponding to g, and Gg G is the stabilizer of Y P V . If V G is a strong obstruction of degree d, then the size dm hence d is completely determined by and m. Existence of an obstruction or a strong obstruction implies that the class variety V f, n, m cannot be embedded in the class variety V g, m , as sought. The main algebro geometric results of GCT1, GCT2 suggest that strong obstructions should indeed exist for all n , assuming n cf. Section 4, Conjecture 2.10 and Theorem 2.11 in GCT2 . The goal then is to prove existence of strong obstructions for all n. The definition of a strong obstruction can be simplified further as follows. Let X denote the set of variables, which consists of the variable entries in X and the homogenizing variable y above. Let W Symm X Y be the space of homogeneous forms of degree m in the variables of X . We have a natural action of X GLn2 1 C on W and hence on P W . We have a natural map W W given by h X ym nh X . The map in is followed by the inclusion from W to V . We also think of as a map from P W to P W . 118 Let f h , for X P W . Let W f P W be the

Chunk: variety for P is V g P V , which is defined to be the projective closure of G g , where g denotes the set of points in P V that are stabilized by Gg G, the stabilizer of g. An explicit description of Gg is given in GCT1 cf. Section 7 therein. To show P NP in characteristic zero, it suffices to show that V f is not a subvariety of V g for all large enough n, if n cf. Conjecture 7.4. in GCT1 . For this, in turn, it suffices to show existence of strong obstructions, defined very much as in Section 7.6, for all n, assumming n . We can then formulate PH1 for the new h X and g Y just as in Hy potheses 7.6.1 and 7.6.2, and the notion of a robust obstruction as in Defi nition 7.6.3. We then have Theorem 7.7.1 Verification of obstructions Analogues of Theorems 7.6.5 and 7.6.6 holds for h X E X and g Y H Y . Furthermore, even discovery of robust obstructions can be conjectured to be easy poly time this would follow from the obvious analogue of Hy pothesis 7.6.9 here. Heuristic argument for existence of robust obstructions is very similar to the one in Section 7.6.6. It needs SH for the special case of the subgroup restriction problem for the embedding Gg G. The group Gg, as described in GCT1 , is a product of some copies of the algebraic torus and the sym 127 metric group. The subgroup restriction problem in this case is akin to but harder than the plethysm problem. 128 Bibliography BGS T. Baker, J. Gill, R. Soloway, Relativization of the P ?NP ques tion, SIAM J.

Chunk: GCT1, GCT2 to showing that the class variety corresponding to the complexity class NP and the pa rameters of the lower bound problem such as the input size cannot be embedded in the class variety corresponding to the complexity class P and the same parameters. Efficient criteria for the decision prob lems stated above are needed to construct explicit obstructions GCT2 to such embeddings, thereby proving their nonexistence. Specifically, Problems 1.1.3 and 1.1.4 are the decision problems associated with Problems 2.5 and 2.6 in GCT2 , respectively. See Sections 7.6 7.7 for a brief review of this story. For these varieties Problem 1.1.4 turns out to be qualitatively similar to Problem 1.1.3 cf. Section 3.5 and GCT2, GCT10 . For this reason, the Kronecker and the plethysm problems, which lie at the heart of the subgroup restriction problem, can be taken as the main prototypes of the decision problems that arise here. One can now ask Question 1.1.5 Do the decision problems above Problems 1.1.1 1.1.3 and Problem1.1.4, when X therein is G P or a class variety belong to P? That is, can the nonvanishing of any of structural constants in these problems be decided in poly time, where x denotes the input specification of the structural constant and its bitlength? For Problem 1.1.2, the input specification for the plethysm constant a , is given in the form of a triple , , . Here the partition is specified as a sequence of positive integers 1 2 the zero parts of the partition are suppressed k is called the height or length of , and is denoted by ht . The bitlength is defined to be the total bitlength of the integers r s. The bitlength is defined to be . A 9 detailed specification of the input specification x and its bitlength for the other problems is given in Section 3.3. For the reasons described in Section 1.6, Question 1.1.5 may not have an affirmative answer in general i.e., these problems may not be in P in their strict form stated above. The following main conjectural complexity theoretic positivity hypothesis governing the flip says that the relaxed forms of these decision problems described in Section 3.3 belong to P. As we shall see in Chapter 7, these relaxed forms suffice for the purposes of the flip. Hypothesis 1.1.6 PHflip The relaxed forms cf. Section 3.3 of Prob lems 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, and the special cases of Problem 1.1.4, when X therein is G P or a class variety which together include all decision prob lems that arise in the flip belong to the complexity class P. This means nonvanishing of any of these structural constants, modulo a small relaxation as described in Section 3.3 , can be decided in poly time, where x denotes the input specification of the structural constant and its bitlength. The phrase modulo a small relaxation in the relaxed form of the plethysm problem means the following a Let ht , where dim G is the dimension of the group G in Problem 1.1.2. Then there exist absolute nonnegative constants c and c , independent of , and , such that nonvanishing of the relaxed stretched plethysm constant ab b ,b , for any positive integral relaxation parameter , can be decided in O poly , , , time, where denotes the bitlength b. The notation poly , , , here means bounded by a polynomial of constant degree in , , and . In particular, the time is O poly , , if the relaxation parameter b is small i.e. if its bitlength is O poly , , . Observe that the bit length of h is O poly , , . b There exists a polynomial time algorithm for deciding nonvanishing of a , , which works correctly on almost all , and . Here polynomial time means O poly , ,

Chunk: observable spectral range between 0.50 and 0.92 m. To remove the solar component of the spectra and obtain the re ectance spectra, the solar analog stars HD 191854, HD 20630 and HD 28099 Hardorp, 1978 were also observed at similar airmasses as the asteroids. In order to estimate the quality of each night, at least two solar analogs were observed per night and we veri ed that the ratios between the corresponding spectra show no signi cant variations. Bias frames, spectral dome at elds and calibration lamps spectra were also taken in each night to allow reduction of the science images. Spectrum exposures for each asteroid were splitted in two exposures at two di erent slit positions, A and B, separated by 20 the width of the slit was 2.0 . The observations were performed with the telescope tracking at the proper motion of the asteroid. Hence by subtracting A from B and B from A, a very accurate background removal is achieved. Finally, standard methods for spectra extraction were applied. 3. Results and discussion The re ectance spectra of Kumakiri and 1991 RY16 are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Both spectra show a steep slope shortwards of 0.70 m and a deep absorption band longwards of 0.75 m. Using the algorithm of Bus , we determine that the spectra can be classi ed as V type. Figure 1 show that our observations are compatible with the spectra of previously known V type asteroids gray lines taken from the SMASS survey Bus Binzel, 2002 and the S3OS2 survey Lazzaro et al., 2004 . Figure 2 show the good agreement between the ve band photometry of the SDSS MOC black lines and the observed spectra. It is worth noting that the values of maximum and minimum re ectance prevents to attribute to these spectra other taxonomic classi cation, like R , O or Q type. 1See http www.caha.es alises cafos cafos22.pdf for more details. 5 In view of this, Kumakiri and 1991 RY16 may be considered, together with Magnya, the only V type asteroids discovered up to now in the outer belt. Notwithstanding, the spectra of Kumakiri and 1991 RY16 show a shal low absorption feature around 0.60 0.70 m that has never been reported before in V type asteroids. This feature is more evident in the spectrum of 1991 RY16. After the its identi cation in the November 14 observations, and excluding possible reduction artifacts or solar analogs problems, we requested Director Discretionary Time DDT for another obser vational run on December 29. Only the spectra of Kumakiri was able to be observed during this run, con rming the presence of the absorption band. Nevertheless, the band in the spectrum of 1991 RY16 has also been observed independently by Moskovitz et al. . To analyze this band, we recti ed the spectra by subtracting a linear continuum in the interval 0.55 and 0.75 m and then tted several polynomials of di erent degrees. This allowed to determine the center of the band at 0.63 0.01 m and the FWHM of 0.1 m e.g. Fig. 3 . The origin of this absorption band is unclear. Such kind of bands are usually believed to arise from the Fe2 Fe3 charge transfer absorptions in phyllosilicate hydrated minerals Vilas Ga ey, 1989 Vilas et al., 1993 . However, it is di cult to explain the presence of a hydrated mineral in the surface of a basaltic object, because the heating and melting that produce the basalt also eliminate any traces of water. It is known that pyroxene crystals Fe2 cations do not show any absorption bands in the spectral region from 0.56 to 0.72 m. Therefore, the origin of the observed band might be related to other impurity cations like Mn2 , Cr3 , and Fe3 , usually located in the M1 site of terrestrial and meteorite orthopyroxenes Shestopalova et al., 2001 . The fact that in the spectrum of 1991 RY16 the band is more evident than in the spectrum of Kumakiri might be due to the larger size of the former asteroid. It is also worth mentioning that the presence of this feature in the spectrum of Kumakiri was independently confirmed by Burbine et al. . 6

Chunk: most K that solves the interpolation problem. We are going to approximate it by a function in A that is small near . Cut it offby and correct via the following inhomogeneous Cauchy Riemann equation 8 JOAQUIM ORTEGA CERD A The function is holomorphic. By using Theorem 6 on it is possible to solve the equation with a solution u such that sup u e . The function h does not solve the problem directly but it almost does. We reiterate the procedure interpolating the error v h and with a convergent series we get finally a function g such that h v , supA h e 2 and moreover in the inner half of the funnel that we denote by A, sup A h e . Now it is easier to make it global. Take a new cutofffunction with support in the funnel A and that is one on the outer part of i.e. A A. Then we need to solve , with good global estimates in S. These are given by Theorem 6. We have solved the interpolation problem when the sequence lies in the funnels. For the general situation we only need to add a finite number of points. The existence of Blaschke type factors h z provided by Theorem 4 shows that is interpolating if is interpolating it is immediate to build functions in the space such that f 0 and f 0 . For the sampling part we need the following definition Definition 8. Given the pair S, of a finite Riemann surface and a subharmonic function defined on it, we associate to it the pairs Di, i ,...n of disks Di and subharmonic functions i defined on the disks as follow If , , . . ., n are the standard charts of the funnels of S we define i is any subharmonic function in Di such that i C in the region z eRi, in eRi z eRi and i 1 in z eRi 2. They can be defined similarly as in , but to make sure we may take instead i z z z Mi z , where is any bounded subharmonic function in Di such that z 1 if z eRi 2 and 0 elsewhere. The funnels Ai can be considered funnels of S and they are subdomains of Di too. We will exploit this double nature in the following theorem Theorem 9. Let S be a finite Riemann surface and let be a subharmonic function with bounded Laplacian. A separated sequence is sampling for A S if and only if all the sequences in the funnels i Ai Di are sampling sequences for A i Di , where Di, i are the associated pairs to S given by Definition 8. Thus this Theorem and Proposition 7 show that the properties of sampling and inter polation only depend on the behavior of the sequence and the weight near the boundary pieces. To prove Theorem 9 we need some previous results INTERPOLATING AND SAMPLING SEQUENCES IN FINITE RIEMANN SURFACES 9 Lemma 10. Let S be a finite Riemann surface and let be a subharmonic function with bounded Laplacian. A sequence S is a uniqueness sequence for A S if and only if all the sequences in the funnels i Ai Di are uniqueness sequences for A i Di , where Di, i are the associated pairs to S given by Definition 8. Proof. It is easier to deal by negation. Let be contained in the zero set of a function f A S . Therefore i is in the zero set of f A Ai . We divide by a finite number of zeros Ei and we obtain a new function g A Ai without zeros in z eRi 2 and such that i Ei Z g . Take the disk Di and consider the cover by two open sets z 1

Chunk: and z eRi 2. On the first set we have the function g and on the second the function 1. The quotient is bounded above and below in the intersection of the sets. This defines a bounded Cousin II in the disk Di problem that can be solved with bounded data. We get a new function h A i Di that vanishes in Z g . We can now add the finite number of zeros Ei without harm. The reciprocal implication follows with the same argument. The next result is inspired by a result of Beurling Beu89, pp. 351 365 that relates the property of sampling sequence to that of uniqueness for all weak limits of the sequence. In the context of the Bernstein space in the original work by Beurling the space was fixed it was C, the space of functions was fixed, the Bernstein class, and he considered translates and limits of it of the sampling sequence . Here we need to move and take limits of the sequence by zooming on appropriate portions of it but we also need to change the support space portions of S near the funnel that look like the unit disk and we will also move the space of functions by changing the weights. We need some definitions Definition 11. We consider triplets Dn, n, n where Dn are disks 0, rn D, n are subharmonic functions defined in a neighborhood of Dn and n is a finite collection of points in Dn. We say that Dn, n, n converges weakly to D, , where D is the unit disk, a subharmonic function in D and a discrete sequence in D if the following conditions are fullfilled The domains Dn tend to D, i.e. rn 1, The weights n tend to the weight in the sense that n as measures converges weakly to . The sequences n converge weakly to , i.e, the measure P n converges weakly to the measure P . Let us fix a point p S. If a sequence of points zn S goes to , i.e. d zn, p , from a point n0 on it will eventually belong to the union of the funnels A1 An. If we take the set of points . In each of the Dn we consider the function Dn and Dn. Thus for any sequence of points zn with d p, zn we build a triplet Dn, n, n for n big enough. Definition 12. Let W S, , be the set of all triplets D, , which are weak limits of triplets Dn, n, n associated to any sequence zn such that d p, zn . The theorem of Beurling on our context is 10 JOAQUIM ORTEGA CERD A Theorem 13. Let S be Riemann surface of finite type and let be a subharmonic function with bounded Laplacian. A separated sequence is sampling for A S if and only if The sequence is a uniqueness set for A S For any triplet D, , W S, , , the sequence is a uniqueness set for A D . Proof. Let us prove that the uniqueness conditions imply that is a sampling sequence. If it were not, there would be a sequence of functions fn A S such that sup fn e 1 n and supS fn e 1. Take a sequence of points zn with fn zn e 1 2. If zn are bounded we can take a subsequence of points that we still denote zn convergent to z S and by a normal family argument there is a partial of fn convergent to f A , such that f 0, f z 0 and this is not possible. Thus zn must be unbounded. Then we take the triplets Dn, n, n associated to zn and Dn D because zn and the hyperbolic radius of Dn is d zn, p

Chunk: . These series can be reorganized by summing only over primitive graphs, with all possible insertions into these primitive graphs. In H, the insertions are afforded 7 by the corresponding Hochschild 1 cocycles. Indeed, I X Prim H,res B Q Sym I X Prim H,res B Q Sym . The universal invariant charge Q is a monomial in the r and their inverses, where r are residues terms in the Lagrangian provided by the theory. In 3 theory we have 2 3. In 3 theory, the universality of Q i. e. the fact that the same Q is good for all Dyson Schwinger equations of the theory comes from a simple topological argument. In nonabelian gauge theories how ever, the universality of Q takes care that the solution of the corresponding system of coupled Dyson Schwinger equations gives rise to a Hopf subalgebra and therefore amounts to the Slavnov Taylor identities for the couplings . The system of coupled Dyson Schwinger equations has 7,8 as its solution. Note that in the first equation of an infinite number of cocycles contributes as there are infinitely many primitive vertex graphs in 3 6 theory the second equation has only finitely many contributions here one. Before we describe how to actually attempt to solve equations of this kind analytically application of the Feynman rules , we discuss the combinatorial ramifications of this con struction in the Hopf algebra. It makes sense to call all systems of recursive equations of the form X n k1 nBd1 n M 1 n . . . X n ks nBds n M s n combinatorial Dyson Schwinger equations, and to study their combinatorics. Here, the Bdn are non exact Hochschild 1 cocycles and the Mn are monomials in the X1 . . . Xs. In we studied a large class of single uncoupled combinatorial Dyson Schwinger equations in a decorated version of Hrt as a model for vertex insertions 1 nwnBdn Xn 1 where the wn Q. For example, B X2 2B X3 is in this class. It turns out that the coefficients cn of X, defined by 0 ncn generate a Hopf subalgebra themselves cn n X . 8 The P n k are homogeneous polynomials of degree n k in the cl, l n. These poly nomials have been worked out explicitly in . One notices in particular that the P n k are independent of the wn and Bdn , and hence that under mild assump tions on the algebraic independence of the cn the Hopf subalgebras generated this way are actually isomorphic. For example, B X2 2B X3 and B X2 yield isomorphic Hopf subalgebras. This is an aspect of the fact that truncation of Dyson Schwinger equations considering only a finite instead of an infinite number of contributing cocycles does make at least combinatorial sense. Indeed, the combinatorics remain invariant. Similar results hold for Dyson Schwinger equations in the true Hopf algebra of graphs H where things are a bit more difficult though as the cocycles there involve some bookkeeping of insertion places. The simplest nontrivial Dyson Schwinger equation one can think of is the linear one B X . Its solution is given by 0 n B n I . In this case X is grouplike and the corresponding Hopf subalgebra of cns is cocommutative . A typical and important non linear Dyson Schwinger equation arises from propagator insertions B 1 X , for example the massless fermion propagator in Yukawa theory where only the fermion line obtains radiative corrections other corrections are ignored . This problem has been studied and solved by Broadhurst and one of the authors in and revisited recently by one of the authors and Yeats . As we now turn to the analytic aspects of Dyson Schwinger equations, we briefly sketch the general approach presented in on how to successfully treat the nonlinearity of Dyson Schwinger

Chunk: many particle effects can not be neglected. Moreover, mean field treatments of the Landau Zener tunneling at best predict a shift of , but cannot account for their distributions. In the chaotic regime, the Fock states are strongly mixed by the dynamics and a fast decaying 4 12 11 10 9 8 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 P log10 5.5 5 4.5 4 log10 0 1 2 3 4 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 0 10 2 10 4 P 10 10 10 9 10 6 10 8 10 10 a b c d FIG. 3 a,c rate distributions in the chaotic regime with F 0.17, .2 U 0.1 , together with the corresponding unscaled P in b,d . In a,b N, L 7, 6 , , and in c,d N, L 9, 8 , . Power laws P x are found with x 2 dashed lines in b,d . Fock state can act as a privileged decay channel for many eigenstates. Many states then share similar rates, lead ing to thinner distributions. Therefore, the thinner dis tribution of Fig. 2 b is a direct signature of the chaotic dynamics evidenced in a , as compared with the regular case in e,f . In Fig. 2 f , we found a good agreement with the expected log normal distribution of decay rates or of the similarly behaving conductance in the regular regime. There the system shows nearly per fect Bloch oscillations , and the motion of the atoms is localized along the lattice . We can even detect a qualitative crossover to a power law P 1 in the right tail of the distribution, as predicted from localiza tion theory . The distributions in Figs. 2 b and 3 follow the expected power law for open quantum chaotic systems in the diffusive regime . The expo nents x are, however, nonuniversal and depend on the opening of the system. In our case, the decay channels are defined by the interband coupling, which in a sense attaches leads to all lattice sites within the sample. Going along with the regular to chaotic transition in the lower band of our model from Fig. 2 f to b , or to Fig. 3 the distributions transform from a log normal to a power law with x 2, in close analogy to the tran sition from Anderson localized to diffusive dynamics in open disordered systems . In summary, our perturbative opening of the single band Wannier Stark system allows one to study Landau Zener like interband tunneling within a many body de scription of the dynamics of ultracold atoms. The statis tical characterization of the tunneling rates mean values and form of the distributions provides clear and robust signatures of the regular to chaotic transition for future experiments. A more detailed analysis of the interband coupling in a full blown model, in which at least two bands are completely included, calls for huge computa tional resources to access the complete quantum spec tra. Nonetheless, our results are a first step in the di rection of studies for which horizontal and vertical quantum transport along the lattice are simultaneously present and influence each other in a complex manner.

Chunk: require only relatively low integrated luminosities for W masses which are not too large, and will employ the traditional l Emiss T W discovery channel. Section II of the paper contains some background material and a historically oriented overview of previous ideas that have been suggested to address the W helicity issue including a discussion of their various strengths and weaknesses. Section III will present an analysis of the W transverse mass distribution and its helicity dependence for a range of W masses, cou pling strengths and LHC integrated luminosities. The use of various asymmetries evaluated in the W W interference region in order to assist with the W helicity determination will also be discussed. Section IV contains a final summary and discussion of our results. 2 Background and History Let us begin by establishing some notation since much of this should be fairly familiar we will be rather sketchy and refer the interested reader to Ref. for details. We denote the couplings of the SM fermions to the , W as GF M2 W 2 1 2 Vff Cl,q i f 1 hi 5 f W i h.c. , where for the case of , the coupling strength for leptons and quarks, respectively and helicity factors are given by Cl,q i , is the CKM unit matrix when f, f are quarks leptons note that the helicity structure for both leptons and quarks is assumed to be the same as in all the model cases above. Following the notation given in Ref. , with some obvious For simplicity in what follows we will further assume that the corresponding RH and LH CKM matrices are identical up to phases and we will generally neglect any possible small effects arising from W W mixing. In the case of RH couplings, we will further assume that the SM neutrinos are Dirac fields. 2 modifications, the inclusive pp W i l X differential cross section can be written as d d dy X qq Vqq 2 h SG qq 1 z2 2AG qq z i , where K is a kinematic numerical factor that accounts for NLO and NNLO QCD corrections as well as leading electroweak corrections and is roughly of order 1.3 for suitably defined couplings, M2 s with M2 being the lepton pair invariant mass. Furthermore, CiCj l CiCj q 1 hihj 2 CiCj l CiCj q hi hj 2 , where the sums extend over all of the exchanged particles in the s channel. Here s s M2 i s M2 j i jMiMj s M2 i 2 2 i M2 i i j , with i the total widths of the exchanged Wi particles. Note that we have employed , the scattering angle in the CM frame defined as that between the incoming u type quark and the outgoing neutrino both being fermions as opposed to being one fermion and one anti fermion . Furthermore, the following combinations of parton distribution functions appear G qq h q xa, M2 q xb, M2 q xb, M2 q xa, M2 , where q q is a u d type quark and xa, e y are the corresponding parton momentum fractions. Analogous expressions can also be written in the case of W i exchange by taking z z and interchanging initial state quarks and anti quarks. 3 In most cases of interest one usually converts the distribution over z above into one over the transverse mass, MT , formed from the final state lepton and the missing transverse energy associated with the neutrino at fixed M, one has 1 M2 T M2 1 2. The resulting transverse mass distribution can then be written as d Z Y Y dy J z MT d d dy dz , where ycut, 1 2 log allows for a rapidity cut on the outgoing leptons and J z MT is the appropriate Jacobian factor .

Chunk: practice, ycut 2.5 for the two LHC detectors. Note that d dMT will only pick out the z even part of d d dy dz as well as the even combination of terms in the product of the parton densities, G qq . In the usual analogous fashion to the Z case , as we will see in our discussion below, one can also define the forward backward asymmetry as a function of the transverse mass, in principle prior to integration over the rapidity y, AF B MT , y , whose numerator now picks out the z odd terms in d d dy dz as well as the odd combination of terms in the parton densities G qq . To be complete, we note that historically when discussing new gauge boson production, particularly when dealing with states which are weakly coupled as will be the case in what fol lows, use is often made of the narrow width approximation NWA . In the W case of relevance here, the NWA essentially replaces the integration over d dM by a function, i.e., the W is assumed to be produced on shell. Thus, for any smooth function f M , essentially, R dM f M R dM f M 2 W M MW 2 W f MW , apart from some overall factors. Note that use of the NWA implies that we evaluate quantities on the peak of the W mass distribution, i.e., at . This approximation is usually claimed to be valid up to O W MW corrections at worst , but there are occasions, e.g., when W W interference is important, when its use can lead to a loss of valuable information and may even lead to wrong conclusions . Unfortunately, in the W case, the quantity M itself is not a true observable due to the missing longitudinal momentum 4 of the neutrino. Given this background, let us now turn to an historical discussion of the determination of the W coupling helicity. To be concrete, we will consider two different W models we will assume for simplicity that Cl,q W 1 in both cases and that only the value of hW 1 distinguishes them. In this situation, employing the NWA, the cross section for on shell W production followed by its leptonic decay is proportional to 1 h2 W and is trivially seen to be independent of the helicity of the couplings. We would thus conclude that cross section measurements are not useful helicity discriminants. More interestingly, as was noted long ago , we find that the rapidity integrated value of AF B, given in the NWA by AF B h2 W 1 h2 W 2 , also has the same value for either purely LH or RH couplings . Thus, in the NWA, AF B provides no help in determining the W coupling helicity structure for the cases we consider here. However, we note that if the quark and leptonic coupling helicities of the W are opposite, then the value of AF B will flip sign in comparison to the above expectation. It is apparent from this result that some other observable s must be used to distinguish these two cases. Keeping the NWA assumption, the first suggestion along these lines was to examine the polarization of s originating in the decay W . In that paper it was explicitly shown that the the energy spectrum of the final state particle in the decay l, or in the rest frame was reasonably sensitive to the original W helicity since the itself effectively decays only through the SM LH couplings of the W provided the W is sufficiently massive as we will assume here . The difficulty with this method is that the observation of this decay mode at the LHC is not all that straightforward and even the corresponding Z mode, which is somewhat easier to observe,

Chunk: 0.1 to 25 GHz, with the 5 10 GHz range being most useful for astrometric planet detection. If 25 of the SKA area at 8 GHz is constructed on baselines of 1000 5000 km, it will supply revolutionary astrometric accuracy Fomalont Reid 2004, New AR, 48, 1473 . With dish antennas of 12m diameter, the combination of sensitivity and wide field of view often will enable many astrometric reference sources to be found in the same antenna field of view as the target star, allowing all temporal variations in Earth s atmosphere to be removed. In such a case, the relative astrometric accuracy may reach 1 as, competitive with SIM and enabling astrometric detection of Earth mass planets. The sensitivity of the SKA will enable astrometric detection of thermal emission from stars. The Sun, for instance, would be detectable to a distance of 10 pc with the SKA. Thus, the SKA will be capable of detecting and characterizing planets around Sun like stars.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0239v1 cond mat.soft 2 Apr 2007 Interface dynamics of microscopic cavities in water Joachim Dzubiella1, 1Physics Department, Technical University Munich, 85748 Garching, Germany Dated February 25, 2013 An analytical description of the interface motion of a collapsing nanometer sized spherical cavity in water is presented by a modification of the Rayleigh Plesset equation in conjunction with ex plicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations. Quantitative agreement is found between the two approaches for the time dependent cavity radius R t at different solvent conditions while in the con tinuum picture the solvent viscosity has to be corrected for curvature effects. The typical magnitude of the interface or collapse velocity is found to be given by the ratio of surface tension and fluid vis cosity, v , while the curvature correction accelerates collapse dynamics on length scales below the equilibrium crossover scales 1nm . The study offers a starting point for an efficient implicit modeling of water dynamics in aqueous nanoassembly and protein systems in nonequilibrium. I. INTRODUCTION Hydrophobic hydration in equilibrium is a phe nomenon which exhibits qualitatively different behavior at small and large length scales.1,2 While small solutes radii R 1nm are accommodated by water with only minor perturbations, larger solutes R 1nm induce ma jor rearrangements of water interfacial structure. As a consequence the solvation free energy G R of small hy drophobic cavities scales with solute volume while for larger cavities it grows with surface area as a good approximation near liquid vapor coexistence accompa nied by weak solvent dewetting at extended restrain ing hydrophobic surfaces.3 Furthermore, water, which is close to the liquid vapor transition at normal condi tions, can minimize interface area by locally evaporat ing and forming a nanobubble within hydrophobic con finement. Evidence of bubble formation in confined ge ometry has been given early by computer simulations of smooth plate like solutes,4 but more recently it has been demonstrated in varying degrees in atomistically resolved plate like solutes,5,6 hydrophobic tubes and ion channels,7,8 and in the collapse of proteins,9,10 suggesting that it plays a key role in the stabilization and folding dynamics of certain classes of biomolecules.11,12 Experi mental evidence of nanobubbles in strong confinement in contrast to bubbles at a single planar surface3 has been given for instance in studies of water between hydropho bic surfaces,13 in zeolites and silica nanotubes,14,15 and on a subnanometer scale in nonpolar protein cavities.16 The dewetting induced change in solvation energy is typically estimated using simple macroscopic arguments as known from capillarity theory, e.g. by describing in terfaces with Laplace Young LY type of equations.14,17 Recently an extension of the LY equation has become available which extrapolates to microscopic scales by in cluding a curvature correction to the interface tension and considering atomistic dispersion and electrostatic potentials of the solvated solute explicitly.18 Although those macroscopic considerations e.g,. the concept of surface tension are supposed to break down on atom istic scales they show surprisingly good results for the solvation energy of microscopic solutes, e.g. alkanes and noble gases, and quantitatively account for dewetting effects in nanometer sized hydrophobic confinement.19 While we conclude that the equilibrium location of the solute solvent interface seems to be well described by those techniques, nothing is known about the interface dynamics of evolution and relaxation. In this study we address two fundamental questions First, what are the equations which govern the interface motion on atomistic 1nm scales? Secondly, does the dynamics exhibit any signatures of the length scale crossover found in equilib rium? On macroscopic scales the collapse dynamics of a va por or gas bubble is related to the well known phe nomenon of sonoluminescence.20 The governing equa tions can be derived from Navier Stokes and capillarity theory and are expressed by the Rayleigh Plesset RP equation, which has been solved numerically and experimentally for the collapse of bubbles and vacuums in liquids.21,22,23,24,25,26 In the context of the present work the RP equation has been modified by us to include curvature corrections to solvent viscosity and surface tension,27 the main effect of the curvature correction being a short time acceleration of the collapse dynamics. Here, we apply the modified RP equation to the interface motion of a spherical cavity collapsing in water, which is governed by the equation ∂R2/∂t2 = (2-nV)R2∂R/∂t + (n-1)R2(∂R/∂t)2/V + 2σ/ρV2R3(1+3ρ2V/4πR3), with R being the cavity radius, t the time, n the polytropic index, V the sol uation volume, σ the surface tension, ρ the fluid density and 27-31.

Chunk: blows up at z , and it is not clear which should be picked. Here we encounter, for the first time, a subtlety of Minkowski space AdS CFT, which is discussed in great length in subsequent sections. At zero temperature this problem can be overcome by an analytic continuation from space like p. However, this will not work at nonzero temperatures. 3.2 Black Three Brane Metric At nonzero temperatures, the metric dual to , fdt2 dx2 R2 r2f dr2 R2d 2 5 , with . The event horizon is located at , where . In contrast to the usual Schwarzschild black hole, the horizon has three flat directions x. The metric is thus called a black three brane metric. We frequently use an alternative radial coordinate u, defined as . In terms of u, the boundary is at , the horizon at , and the metric is TR 2 u2 f u dt2 dx2 R2 4u2f u du2 R2d 2 5 . The Hawking temperature is determined completely by the behavior of the metric near the horizon. Let us concentrate on the t, r part of the metric, r r0 dt2 R2 4r0 r r0 dr2 . Changing the radial variable from r to , 2 r0 , 12 Son, Starinets and the metric components become nonsingular 2 4r2 0 R2 2dt2 ! . Note also that after a Wick rotation to Euclidean time , the metric has the form of the flat metric in cylindrical coordinates, ds2 d 2 2d 2, where 2r0R 2 . To avoid a conical singularity at 0, must be a periodic variable with periodicity 2 . This fact matches with the periodicity of the Euclidean time in thermal field theory 1 T, from which one finds the Hawking temperature R2 . One of the first finite temperature predictions of AdS CFT correspondence is that of the ther modynamic potentials of the . The entropy is given by the Bekenstein Hawking formula 4G , where A is the area of the horizon of the metric the result can then be converted to parameters of the gauge theory using Eqs. , , and . One obtains 2 2 N 2T 3 , which is 3 4 of the entropy density in t Hooft coupling. We now try to generalize the AdS CFT prescription to finite temperature. In the Euclidean formulation of finite temperature field theory, field theory lives in a space time with the Euclidean time direction compactified. The metric is regular at If one views the , r space as a cigar shaped surface, then the horizon . Thus, r0 is the minimal radius where the space ends, and there is no point in space with r less than r0. The only boundary condition at , and the AdS CFT correspondence is formulated as Z4D J Z5D J . 4 REAL TIME AdS CFT In many cases we must find real time correlation functions not given directly by the Euclidean path integral formulation of thermal field theory. One example is the set of kinetic coefficients expressed, through Kubo s formulas, via a certain limit of real time thermal Green s functions. Another related example appears if we want to directly find the position of the poles in the correlation functions that would correspond to the hydrodynamic modes. In principle, some real time Green s functions can be obtained by analytic continuation of the Euclidean ones. For example, an analytic continuation of a two point Euclidean propagator gives a retarded or advanced Green s function, depending on the way one performs the continuation. However, it is often very difficult to directly compute a quantity of interest in that way. In particular, it is very difficult to get the information about the hydrodynamic small , small k limit of real time correlators from Euclidean propagators. The problem here is that we need to perform an analytic continuation

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0241v1 cond mat.supr con 2 Apr 2007 Superconducting states of the quasi 2D Holstein model Effects of vertex and non local corrections J.P.Hague Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 7RH Abstract. I investigate superconducting states in a quasi 2D Holstein model using the dynamical cluster approximation DCA . The effects of spatial fluctuations non local corrections are examined and approximations neglecting and incorporating lowest order vertex corrections are computed. The approximation is expected to be valid for electron phonon couplings of less than the bandwidth. The phase diagram and superconducting order parameter are calculated. Effects which can only be attributed to theories beyond Migdal Eliashberg theory are present. In particular, the order parameter shows momentum dependence on the Fermi surface with a modulated form and s wave order is suppressed at half filling. The results are discussed in relation to Hohenberg s theorem and the BCS approximation. Published as J. Phys. Condens. Matter vol. 17 5663 5676 PACS numbers 71.10. w, 71.38. k, 74.20. z, 74.62. c 1. Introduction The discovery of large couplings between electrons and the lattice in the cuprate superconductors has led to a call for more detailed theoretical studies of electron phonon systems in low dimensions . One of the best known traditional approaches to the electron phonon problem is attributed to Migdal and Eliashberg . In a bulk 3D system, the perturbation theory may be sharply truncated at 1st order and momentum dependence neglected if the phonon frequency is much less than the Fermi energy . In physical terms, Migdal s approach requires that there is a very high probability that emitted phonons are reabsorbed in a last in first out order. The typical materials of interest at the time were bulk metallic superconductors where electron phonon coupling is relatively weak, and the phonon frequency small compared to the Fermi energy. For this reason, the application of Migdal Eliashberg ME theory has been very successful and remains highly regarded. Strong electron phonon coupling and large phonon frequencies in low dimensional systems are outside the limits of validity of the Migdal Eliashberg approach. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to evaluate and discuss the effects of both vertex corrections VC and spatial fluctuations on the theory of coupled electron phonon systems in the superconducting state. This follows on from the work by Hague treating the normal non superconducting state of the Holstein model using DCA . Initial attempts to include vertex corrections were carried out by Engelsberg and Schrieffer . Other previous attempts to extend ME theory include the introduction of vertex corrections into the Eliashberg equations by Grabowski and Sham , and Superconducting states of the quasi 2D Holstein model 2 an expansion to higher order in the Migdal parameter by Kostur and Mitrovi c to investigate the 2D electron phonon problem . Grimaldi et al. generalised the Eliashberg equations to include momentum dependence and vertex corrections . An anomalous hardening of the phonon mode was seen by Alexandrov and Schrieffer . A discussion of the applicability of these and other approximations to the vertex function can be found in reference . The current paper uses DCA to introduce a fully self consistent momentum dependent self energy. DCA extends DMFT by introducing short range fluctuations in a controlled manner . It is particularly good at describing the electron phonon problem, due to the limited momentum dependence of the self energy, and in this case, the self consistent DCA can be viewed as an expansion about the Eliashberg equations in which momentum dependence is effectively coarse grained in a manner similar to DMFT . In contrast to the Eliashberg equations, the full form of the Green s function is considered here, rather than the renormalised weak coupling Green s function which has the form G 1 o k, i n Zi n 0 o k 3 1 . Two approximations

Chunk: is significantly reduced as the system moves away from half filling panel b , indicating that Midgal Eliashberg theory is more accurate in dilute systems. This is expected, since in very dilute systems, the electron density is sufficiently low that electrons meet very infrequently, and therefore the crossed diagrams of figure 2b have extremely small contributions. By scanning vertically, the effect of including vertex corrections can be seen. Corrections are strongest close to half filling, and drop offas the edge of the superconducting phase is reached. Migdal Eliashberg theory is clearly quite accurate for dilute 2D systems, but it consistently fails close to half filling. Initially, it seems as though vertex corrections are larger than the vertex neglected results at .12. In fact, this is not the case. As discussed in ref. , at half filling vertex corrections act to reduce the magnitude of the phonon self energy, so there is much less renormalisation of the phonon propagator. A smaller phonon propagator means that the effective coupling is smaller, stabilising the expansion in eff. There is a dip in the anomalous self energy because the vertex corrections drop offmore quickly in n, with opposite sign to ME, which is an indication that the approximation is close to breakdown at half filling. The slight increase in the anomalous self energy at .54 due to vertex corrections comes about from a change in form of the electronic Green s function. For half filling, the Green s function at the van Hove points is pure imaginary, whereas for the dilute system, it is mostly real, so sums over products of Green s functions can change sign with respect to the Migdal Eliashberg result. This sign change is also seen in DMFT simulations of the 3D Holstein model . At this stage, it is appropriate to examine the size of the parameter effthat defines the vertex correction expansion. Since the expansion in this case is in the full phonon Green s function, the expansion parameter is renormalised by the phonons, and reads D i , where D i is the phonon propagator at zero Matsubara frequency. For dilute systems, D is typically small, and so effis small N.B. Unlike in 3D, D is never zero in 2D, because of the discontinuity in the band edge of the non interacting DOS . Close to half filling, the DOS in 2D is divergent, and this parameter is expected to be large. In the current approximation, a small interplanar hopping was applied to stabilise the solution, so effis smaller than expected in a pure 2D system. As noted in ref. , D is reduced by vertex corrections as compared to the Migdal Eliashberg result. For most energies, the bare density of states in 2D is smaller than the bare density of states in 3D, since the divergence drops offlogarithmically close to half filling. Therefore, effis only really large for . For the mid to dilute limits, the relative magnitude of the second order vertex correction goes like 2 0.04. At half filling, with the current parameters, 2 0.5, so the approximation can only be considered to be qualitatively correct. Nonetheless, the current approximation has features appropriate to Hohenberg s theorem discussed later and the bare DOS drops offso quickly moving away from half filling, that results are expected to be accurate for most n. How do the differences in the self energy relate to observable quantities? One of the big questions in unconventional superconductivity concerns the possible forms that the order parameter can take, and a large discussion has grown up around issues such as the existence of unconventional order parameters such as extended s wave and higher harmonics. To examine this idea, I demonstrate the evolution of the shape of the anomalous pairing density ns k T P n F k, i n , which is related to the order parameter. In this paper, the superconducting

Chunk: The ground state energy calculation of a non-relativistic system with an external magnetic field in CSDFT is explained. The ground state energy of this system can be represented as a functional of three independent densities: the particle density r, the magnetization density mr, and the paramagnetic current density jpr. This functional is given by the equation E = Ts, m, jp + U + Exc, m, jp, where Ts, m, jp is the kinetic energy functional of non-interacting electrons, U is the Hartree energy, and Exc, m, jp is the exchange correlation energy. The minimization of the equation with respect to the three basic densities leads to the Kohn-Sham (KS) equation, which is a key equation in the CSDFT.

Chunk: only by the redefi nition of the matrix , which now also contains an extra term depending upon the current density and its con jugate field. Due to their similar structure the CSDFT OEP equations are solved by generalizing the residue al gorithm , successfully applied to solve the non collinear SDFT equations 19 21 . The only difference in the case of CSDFT is introduction of an additional residue coming from the third OEP equation in Eq. . In the present work we have used the exchange only exact exchange EXX functional to solve the OEP equations. The EXX gauge invariant energy functional is the Fock exchange 3 energy but evaluated with KS spinors EEXX x 1 2 Z Z occ X i,j i r j r j r i r r r d3r d3r . In order to keep the numerical analysis as accurate as possible, in the present work all calculations are per formed using the state of the art full potential linearized augmented plane wave FPLAPW method , imple mented within the EXCITING code . The single electron problem is solved using an augmented plane wave basis without using any shape approximation for the effective potential. Likewise, the magnetization and current densities and their conjugate fields are all treated as unconstrained vector fields throughout space. The deep lying core states 3 Ha below the Fermi level are treated as Dirac spinors and valence states as Pauli spinors. To obtain the Pauli spinor states, the Hamilto nian containing only the scalar fields is diagonalized in the LAPW basis this is the first variational step. The scalar states thus obtained are then used as a basis to set up a second variational Hamiltonian with spinor de grees of freedom, which consists of the first variational eigenvalues along the diagonal, and the matrix elements obtained from the external and effective vector fields in Eq. . This is more efficient than simply using spinor LAPW functions, but care must be taken to ensure there are a sufficient number of first variational eigenstates for convergence of the second variational problem. Spin orbit coupling is also included at this stage. As was shown above for CSDFT, the magnetic field couples not only to spin but also to the orbital degrees of freedom through the vector potential. This makes CS DFT specifically important for magnetic materials and particularly interesting for their orbital properties. By analogy with SDFT, one might expect that the introduc tion of the paramagnetic current density gives an im provement in properties such as orbital moments and spin orbit induced band splitting, which are related to this new basic variable. However, within the framework of existing functionals it is yet to be established conclu sively that CSDFT performs better than SDFT for these properties. The recent development of the OEP method both for SDFT and CSDFT allows for a direct compar ison of these two approaches for the same xc functional, namely EXX. The orbital moments of spontaneous magnets Fe, Co and Ni, in the absence of external magnetic fields and with spin orbit coupling included, are presented in Ta ble I. For SDFT, the LSDA, GGA and EXX functionals are used, while for CSDFT the values are obtained us ing the EXX functional. It is clear from Table I that there is no difference between the results obtained us ing EXX CSDFT and EXX SDFT.

Chunk: from the experimental value. tem. Nevertheless, it is standard practice to compute the orbital magnetic moment L, like those listed in Table I, which is related to jp from the KS orbitals by the relation jp r d3r. The fact the EXX SDFT and EXX CSDFT orbital moments are so close may be viewed as a post hoc justification of this practice for magnetic metals. It should also be noted that in comparison to experiments the EXX results are significantly worse than their LSDA and GGA counterparts. One reason, of course, is the fact that LSDA and GGA also include correlation in an ap proximate way which is neglected completely within the EXX framework. In a recent work it is shown that the use of the EXX functional in the framework of SCDFT, improves the spin orbit induced splitting of the bands in semicon ductors. Unfortunately, it is not clear if this improve ment is due to the use of different functionals going from LSDA to EXX , or due to the use of an extra den sity when going from SDFT to CSDFT. This has moti vated us to compare CSDFT and SDFT results for this quantity using the same functional in both cases. We have determined the value of this splitting for solid Si and Ge and the results are presented in Table II. While the EXX functional significantly improves the agreement with experimental values, there is almost no change on going from SDFT to CSDFT. Thus the improvement is solely due to the orbital based functional. We also note that the EXX CSDFT results of Ref. are significantly different from ours, and in much worse agreement with experiments. This might be due to the use of pseudopo tentials in the previous work. In this respect it is worth noting that EXX derived KS energy gaps also show sig nificant differences depending on whether an all electron full potential or pseudopotential method is used . The paramagnetic current density of Ge for LSDA, GGA, EXX SDFT and EXX CSDFT is plotted in Fig. 1. Ge is chosen as an example since the spin orbit in duced splitting is largest for this system and, unlike in the case of metallic orbital moments, this quantity does show some difference on going from SDFT to CSDFT. We immediately notice that there is no significant qual itative difference between the LSDA and GGA currents. There are, however, pronounced differences in the cur 4 Symmetry SDFT CSDFT point Exp.

This is an inter esting finding since it indicates the tendency of semi local functionals towards higher values of the paramag netic current density. It is worthwhile noting previous EXX C SDFT results for open shell atoms in which it was found that this effect was even more pronounced and lead to vanishing currents. Even though the EXX SDFT current is considerably lower in magnitude than that of EXX CSDFT and also has a less symmetric structure, the spin orbit splittings for the two cases are almost the same. Similar conclusions regarding the total energies were also drawn for quantum dots in external magnetic fields studied using EXX and other functionals of the current density . From Fig. 1 it is also clear

Chunk: p3 p2 p1 p1 p2 p3 p4 k2 4 k2 2 k4k2 Table 1 The various contributions to the all plus four point vertex. Note that we use the simplifying notation ki ki z. where V is given by the following expression 12 p4 q p2 p4 k2 3 k2 4 k3k4 p1 q p1 p3 k2 1 k2 4 k1k4 p2 q p2 p4 k2 2 k2 1 k2k1 p3 q p3 p1 k2 3 k2 2 k2k3 p2 p3 p1 p4 k2 1 k2 3 k1k3 p3 p4 p2 p1 k2 4 k2 2 k4k2 . Comparing this to the expected answer , we see that the quadratic antiholomorphic momentum dependence should arise from the various k z factors in . In , CQT start from essentially the same expression and demonstrate that it gives the correct result for the all plus amplitude. Therefore, following practically the same steps as those authors, we can easily see that we obtain the expected answer. However, since we would like to find the full vertex V, we will need to keep off shell information, and so we will choose a slightly different route. 12For the sake of brevity we omit a subscript z in the region momenta appearing in . 17 The main complication in bringing into a manageable form is clearly the presence of the region momenta. We would like to disentangle their effects as cleanly as possible. Therefore, our derivation will proceed by the following steps 1. First, we will show that can be manipulated so that the quadratic dependence on region momenta drops out, leaving only terms linear in the region momenta. 2. Second, we will decompose the resulting expression into a part that depends on the region momenta and one that does not. The k dependent part turns out to have a very simple form, and vanishes on shell. 3. Finally, we will show that the k independent part reduces to the known amplitude. For the first step, we will need the following identity, which is proved in appendix B p4 q p2 p4 p1 q p1 p3 p2 q p2 p4 p3 q p3 p1 p2 p3 p1 p4 p3 p4 p2 p1 0 Also, using the shorthand notation Kij ki z 2 kj z 2 ki zkj z we note the following very useful identity kj z kk z ki z kj z kk z Kik kj z kk z lijk where 1 k n and z kj z kk z. Noting that, for , kj z kk z pk 2 z pj z, we can use this to rewrite all the region momentum combinations appearing in in the following way K12 K23 K34 K41 p3 p4 l124 l234 2 p2 p3 l134 K12 K23 K34 K41 p2 p3 l134 l123 2 p3 p4 l124 K12 K23 K34 K41 p3 p4 l124 l234 2 p2 p3 l123 K12 K23 K34 K41 p2 p3 l134 l123 2 p3 p4 l234 K12 K23 K34 K41 p3 p2 l123 p1 p4 l134 K12 K23 K34 K41 p4 p3 l234 p2 p1 l124 where we have introduced the notation z. We have thus expressed all the quadratic region momentum dependence in terms of the common factor K12 K23 K34 K41, and, given , it is clear that this contribution will vanish.13 13One could have chosen a different combination of the Kij s, but we find the symmetric choice in convenient. 18 After this step, we are left with an expression which is linear in the region momenta. We will now proceed in a similar way, and rewrite all the expressions that contain lijk in terms of a suitably chosen common factor l124 k1 z k2 z k3 z k4 z 1 2 p1 z p3 z p4 z p2 z 1 3 p1 z p2 z p4 z p3 z 1 4 p1 z p2 z p3 z p4 z 2 2 p1 z p2 z p4 z p3 z 2 3 p1 z p2 z p3 z p4 z 2 4 p1 z p2 z p3 z p4 z 3 3 p1 z p2 z p3 z p4 z 3 4 p1 z p2 z p3 z p4 z 4 4 p1 z p2 z p3 z p4 z We can then rewrite the entire expression in terms of the new common factor l124 k1 z k2 z k3 z k4 z. This is shown in the following steps. 1. We can rewrite the expressions in as follows 2 p4 p2 p1 q p4 k2 3 p2 p1 q p1 p3 k2 4 k3k4 p2 q p2 p4 k2 2 k2 1 k2k1 p3 p1 k2 3 k2 2 k2k3 p2

Chunk: 1 2 2p2 z p3 z p1 z k1 z k2 z k3 z k4 z 1 2 2p1 z p2 z p4 z k1 z k2 z k3 z k4 z 1 2 2p3 z p4 z p2 z k1 z k2 z k3 z k4 z 1 2 2p4 z p1 z p3 z In appendix B we show that the total coefficient of the common k1 z k2 z k3 z k4 z factor is 3 8 p4 q p2 p4 p3 p4 p2 p3 p1 q p1 p3 p2 p3 p3 p4 p2 q p2 p4 p3 p4 p2 p3 p3 q p3 p1 p2 p3 p3 p4 p2 p3 p1 p4 1 2 p3 p2 1 2 p1 p4 p3 p4 p2 p1 1 2 p4 p3 1 2 p2 p1 3 16 4 X pi 2 pi , where pi 2 is the full covariant momentum squared, and ij pi pj z pj pi z. Thus we see that the complete dependence on the region momenta can be rewritten as follows V 4 X z 4 X pi 2 pi . It is rather satisfying that the region momentum dependence of the vertex takes this simple form, which clearly vanishes when the external legs are on shell, and thus will not contribute to the all plus amplitudes. Having completely disentangled the region momenta k z from the actual momenta p z, we will now focus on the terms containing only the latter, which were produced during the 19 decompositions in . After a few simple manipulations, they can be rewritten as14 V p4 q p2 p4 p1 p2 p1 p2 p3 p2 p3 p2 p1 q p1 p3 p2 p3 p2 p3 p4 p3 p4 p3 p2 q p2 p4 p3 p4 p3 p4 p1 p4 p1 p4 p3 q p3 p1 p4 p1 p4 p1 p2 p1 p2 p1 p2 p3 p1 p4 p3 p2 p1 p4 p1 p2 2 p3 p4 p2 p1 p4 p3 p2 p1 p2 p3 2 . This expression, together with is our proposal for the off shell four point all plus vertex that should be part of the MHV rules formalism at the quantum level. It would be very interesting to elucidate its structure and bring it into a more compact form. For the moment, however, we will be content to demonstrate that is equal on shell to the sought for amplitude. To that end, we will follow a similar approach to CQT, and rewrite all the holomorphic spinor brackets in terms of the following three , , . To achieve this, we use momentum conservation and a certain cyclic identity see appendix A to write p4 q p2 p4 p4 q p4 q p3 q p4 p4 q p3 p4 p4 2 p4 q p3 q p1 q p3 p4 2 p4 q p3 p1 p4 p4 p3 . In a similar way, we can show that p2 q p2 p4 p2 q p3 p1 p2 p2 p3 , p3 q p1 p3 p3 p3 p2 p3 p1 p2 p3 q p1 p3 . Collecting all the terms together, and manipulating the resulting expressions, it is straight 14We write . 20 forward to show that simplifies to just V p1 p2 p1 p2 p2 p3 p2 p3 p1 p2 p1 p4 q p3 p1 p1 p2 p2 p3 , where we use the z pj pi 1 2 q pi pj ij . Converting to the usual antiholomorphic bracket notation, we rewrite as V q p3 p4 p1 p2 p1 p2 p2 p3 q p2 p3 p2 p3 p1 p2 p1 p4 p1 p2 p1 q p3 p4 p2 q p2 p1 p2 p3 p1 q p2 p3 p3 q p1 p4 . Note that so far this expression is completely offshell. We will now take the onshell limits and use the spinor formalism to demonstrate that is equal to the desired amplitude. The onshell limits are simple to implement, and the result is a very compact expression, which we will now present. In order to do so, we must first remove the momentum flow by replacing the spinor brackets with the corresponding momentum space brackets, which are defined as q ij = q i j and q ijz = q i - q j j . We then rewrite the expression as q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij q ij

Chunk: In doing this we will keep track of the p2 terms that appear when applying momentum conservation in the form X k kj q pi pj X k pk 2 pk . These terms are collected in appendix B. We start by rewriting each of the terms in the last two lines of as follows p1 q p3 p4 p1 p2 p1 q p3 p4 p1 p2 p3 q p1 p2 p1 p2 p2 p3 p1 p2 p3 q p2 p3 p1 p2 p1 q p2 p3 p2 p3 p1 q p2 p3 p2 p3 p3 q p1 p4 p2 p3 p3 q p3 p4 p2 p3 p4 p3 p2 p3 . We also transform the term using the Schouten identity and also momentum con servation, q p2 p3 q p3 p4 q p1 p3 q p2 p3 , 21 and add up all contributions to the term, which are 1 4 2 q p3 p4 4 p2 p1 p1 p2 2 p3 p1 p1 p3 1 4 2 q p3 p4 4 2 . Converting to the spinor bracket, the first of these terms is 1 2 q p1 p2 p3 p4 , while the remaining terms from and combine to give q p1 p3 q p2 p3 p2 p3 p1 p2 p1 p4 p2 p2 p1 p2 p4 p2 p3 p3 p2 p3 p1 p2 p1 p4 p2 p2 p1 p2 p4 p2 p3 p3 2 p2 p3 p1 2p1 p2 p3 2 p3 where we suppress an overall 1 4 2 and we see that cancels the second term in , thus showing that is the complete on shell answer. Reintroducing all the prefactors, we thus find that the amplitude is 2 2g2 p p1 p2 p3 p4 1 1 2 q p1 p2 p3 p4 g4N 12 2 . Now note that, as discussed in appendix A, in order to convert to the usual Yang Mills theory normalisation we need to send g g 2. We conclude that A gives precisely the result for the all plus scattering amplitude. 3.3 The general all plus amplitude We have just given an explicit derivation of the four point all plus amplitude, from the two point counterterm . We will argue in the following that this two point counterterm contains all the all plus amplitudes. First, we can see immediately that the counterterm has the right kind of structure. Consider the n point all plus amplitude A n X 1 jk li . 22 In terms of spinor brackets this amplitude has terms of the form 2 n 2. A quick look at the Ettle Morris coefficients shows that, for an n point vertex coming from LCT, they contribute exactly 2 n powers of the spinor brackets . Furthermore, there are exactly two powers of coming from the counterterm Lagrangian LCT k2 z A2 one for each power of k. Thus the general structure of LCT is appropriate to reproduce . Pictorially, we can represent the general n point amplitude, arising from the counterterm in the new variables, as in Figure 5. Bi Bi 1 Bj 1 Bj Bj 1 Bi 1 ki kj Figure 5 The structure of a generic term contributing to the n point vertex. All momenta are taken to be outgoing, and all indices are modulo n.

Chunk: amplitude using only tree level combinatorics. 2.1 The classical MHV Lagrangian It seemed clear from the beginning that the MHV diagram approach to Yang Mills theory must be closely related to lightcone gauge theory. This idea was substantiated by Mansfield see also . The starting point of is the lightcone gauge fixed YM Lagrangian for the fields corresponding to the two physical polarisations of the gluon. It was argued convincingly in that a certain canonical change of the field variables re expresses this lightcone Lagrangian as a theory containing the infinite series of MHV vertices. Some of the arguments in were rather general these were reviewed in , where the change of variables was discussed in more detail, and in particular it was shown how the four and five point MHV vertices arise from the change of variables. In this paper we will mainly follow the notation of . The general structure of the lightcone YM Lagrangian, after integrating out unphysical degrees of freedom, is see appendix A for more details , where the gauge condition is A 0 with the null vector 1 2, 0, 0, 1 2 . Since this Lagrangian contains a vertex, it is not of MHV type. In , Mansfield proposed to 3 eliminate this vertex through a suitably chosen field redefinition. Specifically, he performed a canonical change of variables from A, A to new fields B, B , in such a way that L A, A L A, A L B, B . The remarkable result is that upon inserting this change of variables into the remaining two vertices, the Lagrangian, written in terms of B, B , becomes a sum of MHV vertices, . . . . The crucial property of Mansfield s transformation that makes this possible is that, while both A and A are series expansions in the new B fields, A has no dependence on the B fields while A turns out to be linear in B. Thus, since the remaining vertices are quadratic in the B, the new interaction vertices have the helicity configuration of an MHV amplitude. Mansfield was also able to show that the explicit form of the vertices coincides with the CSW off shell continuation of the Parke Taylor formula for the MHV scattering amplitudes, as proposed by . One of the main results of was the derivation of an explicit, closed formula for the expansion of the original fields A, A in terms of the new fields B, B . This was then used to verify that the new vertices are indeed precisely the MHV vertices of , at least up to the five point level. We will now briefly review these results. First, recall that the positive helicity field A is a function of the positive helicity B field only. It is expanded as follows A p X n Y 2 3 p , p 1, . . . p n Y p 1 n B p 1 B p 2 B p n , where p , p 1, . . . p n 2 3 p p 1 p n . Note that the x coordinate is common to all the fields, which is why we have restricted the transformation to the lightcone quantisation surface .

Chunk: p 2 B p 3 . 4 Similarly, one can write down the expansion of the negative helicity field A, which, as discussed above, is linear in B, but is an infinite series in the new field B. In it was shown that the coefficients in the expansion of A are very closely related to those for A.2 The expansion of B turns out to be simply A p X 1 Z n Y 2 3 p , p 1, . . ., p n ps 2 p 2 Y p 1 n B p 1 B p s B p n X n Y 2 3 p , p 1, . . . , p n 1 p 2Y p 1 n n X ps 2 B p 1 B p s B p n . Thus we see that at each order in the expansion, we need to sum over all possible positions of B. Explicitly, the first few terms are A p B p 2ig Z d3p1d3p2 2 3 p p 1 p 2 1 p p p1 p2 1 p1 2 B p 1 B p 2 p2 2B p 1 B p 2 2g2 Z d3p1d3p2d3p3 2 6 p p 1 p 2 p 3 1 p p p1 p3 1 p1 2 B p 1 B p 2 B p 3 p2 2B p 1 B p 2 B p 3 p3 2B p 1 B p 2 B p 3 Using the above results, it is in principle straightforward to derive the terms that arise on inserting the Mansfield transformation into the two remaining vertices of the theory. For the simplest cases, one can see explicitly that these combine to produce MHV vertices, and some arguments were also given in that this must be true in general. In supersymmetric theories, the MHV vertices are enough to reproduce complete scat tering amplitudes at one loop . However, as we mentioned earlier, for pure YM it is clear that the terms in the MHV Lagrangian will not be enough to generate complete quantum amplitudes. For instance, the scattering amplitude with all gluons with positive helicity, which at one loop is finite and given by a rational term, cannot be obtained by only using MHV diagrams, for the simple reason that one cannot draw any diagram contributing to it by only resorting to MHV vertices.3 Another amplitude which cannot be derived within conventional MHV diagrams is the amplitude with only one gluon of negative helicity. Simi larly to the all plus amplitude, this single minus amplitude vanishes at tree level, and at one loop is given by a finite, rational function of the spinor variables. 2This is perhaps easiest to see by considering that, in the context of , A and B are part of the same lightcone superfield. 3On the other hand, it was shown in that the parity conjugate all minus amplitude is correctly generated by using MHV diagrams. 5 The lesson we learn from this is that, in order to apply the MHV method to derive complete amplitudes in pure YM, one should look more closely at the change of variables in the full quantum theory. There are several possible subtleties one should pay careful attention to at the quantum level. First of all, it is possible that the canonical nature of the transformation is not preserved, leading to a non trivial Jacobian which could provide the missing amplitudes. Another possible source of contributions could come from violations of the equivalence theorem. This theorem states that, although correlation functions of the new fields are in general different from those of the old fields, the scattering amplitudes are actually the same4, as long as the new fields are good interpolating fields. These issues were explored in some detail in see also where it was shown, for a different non canonical field redefinition, how a

Starting from the expression we arrive at the fol lowing results for the density density response function 00 i q, 00 i q, i q, K0 00 i q, 1 8i h q K0 01 i q, 4 h q 2 i q, . 2 Here i q, K0 00 i q, K0 11 i q, K0 01 i q, 2. Within the RPA response functions included in Eqs. , are simply related to components of the CF conduc tivity tensor 1 i xx q, iq2 e2 1 K0 00 i q, 1 K0 00 i q,0 i yy q, ie2 K0 11 i q, K0 11 i q,0 i i i q, . To proceed we calculate the components of the CF conductivity at slightly away from 1 2. In this case CFs experience a nonzero effective magnetic field . We concentrate on the ballistic contribution to the transresistivity, so we need asymptotics for the rel evant conductivity components applicable in a nonlocal ql 1 and high frequency 1 regime. Cor responding expressions for ij were obtained in earlier works . However, these results are not appropriate for our analysis for they do not provide a smooth passage to the Beff 0 limit at finite q. Due to this reason we do not use them in further calculations. To get a suitable approximation for the CF conductivity we start from the standard solution of the Boltzmann transport equation for the CF distribution function. This gives us the fol lowing results for the CF conductivity components for a single layer m e2 2 h 2 1 Z 2 0 d v exp iq Z 0 vx d Z v exp iq Z 0 vx d 1 1 i d . Here, m , are the CF effective mass and the cyclotron frequency at the effective magnetic field Beff is the angular coordinate of the CF cyclotron orbit. Now we carry out some formal transformations of this expression following the way proposed before . First, we expand the CF velocity components v in Fourier series v X k vk exp ik . Substituting this expansion into we obtain m e2 2 h 2 X k vk Z 2 0 d v exp ik Z 0 exp ik i 1 iqvx iq Z 0 vx vx d d where . Then we introduce a new variable which is related to the variable as follows ik i 1 iqvx iq Z 0 vx vx d , and we arrive at the result im e2 2 h 2 X k vk Z 0 e d Z 2 0 v exp ik i k qvx d . Under the conditions of interest 1, ql 1, and also assuming that the filling factor is close to 1 2, so that qvF vF is the CFs Fermi velocity , the variable is approximately equal to 1 iql cos ik i 1. Taking this into account and expanding the last term in the denominator of in powers of we obtain qvx qvx q 1 iql cos ik i 1 dvx d q 2 2 2 1 iql cos ik i 2 d2vx d 2 . Substituting this asymptotic expression into we can calculate first terms of the expansions of relevant compo nents of the CF conductivity in powers of the small pa rameter qR 1 where is the CF cyclotron radius.

Chunk: determine all the fluxes and the spin connection in terms of the functions b, and their derivatives. First it is convenient to introduce the new basis9 0 1 2 12 c0 b 1c2 c0 bc1 c12 , 8It might be of interest to investigate the possible relation between this hidden symmetry and the Ehlers group for solutions of four dimensional vacuum gravity with a Killing vector. 9Note that o 1, 0, 0, 0 in this basis. 25 in which the Killing spinor equations for o 2 read A MA 0 , with the connection MA given by M 0 ln b 0 0 0 ln b ln b ln b 0 0 b b 2l 1 2 ln b b 2 l b ln b 0 b 2 ln b 0 b b 2l 1 2 ln bb , 0 0 b 2 ln b b 2 ln b 0 ln b b 2 ln b b 2 ln b 0 ln b b b 2l b 2 1 2 ln bb 0 0 0 2 l b ln b b b 2l b 2 1 2 ln b b , M 0 ln b 0 0 0 ln bb 0 0 0 2 l b ln b ln b e 0 0 2 lb ln b 0 ln b e , M 0 0 ln b ln b 2 l b 0 0 ln bb 2 lb ln bb 2 l b 0 0 ln q b be ln b 0 0 ln b ln q b be . Let us first of all consider the simpler possibility of a second Killing spinor of the form o . As discussed in section 2.1, both o 1 and o 2 are invariant under the same U symmetry, and hence this case constitutes the . As can easily be seen from the above Killing spinor equations with 1 0 and , this restricts the derivatives of the coefficient b to be , b l , . Hence this corresponds to . As will be discussed in section 5.1, this restric tion uniquely leads to the half supersymmetric anti Nariai space time. Hence AdS2 H2 is the only possibility for backgrounds with four U invariant Killing spinors. In the more general case with 2 and 12 non vanishing, i.e. with trivial stability subgroup, the Killing spinor equations do not so readily provide information about b 26 and one has to resort to their integrability conditions. The first integrability conditions for the linear system are N M M M , M 0 , where the matrices M EA MA are given by b 2M M , b 2 M b 2M , wMt 1 2 b e M , M wMt 1 2 b e M , and we introduced the complex coordinates , . For half supersymmetric solutions, the six matrices N must have rank two. As at least one Killing spinor exists, namely o 1, 0, 0, 0 , we already know that the N can have at most rank three. Rank one is not possible, because 3 4 BPS solutions cannot exist . Rank zero corresponds to the maximally supersymmetric case, which implies that the spacetime geometry is AdS4 . Let us define N SN T , with 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 , 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 . The similarity transformation S corresponds to adding the first line to the second one and T adds the last column to the third one. This does not alter the rank of N .

In addition, we will show that the Killing spinor equations can be completely solved when the second Killing spinor is time independent. Let us first simplify the Killing spinor equations . In the following we set and define , 1, 2, 12 and 10In order to show this, one has to make use of eqns. and . 11This follows from the vanishing of the 3 3 determinant that is obtained from Nwt by deleting the first column and the third line. 28 2 12.

The new Killing spinors corresponding to 2 and 4 both have17 . To study the action of the AdS4 isometries it is useful to embed the hyperboloid in a five dimensional flat space U, V, T, X, Y with metric . Then, AdS4 is the hypersurface U2 V 2 T 2 X2 Y 3,2 isometries of the embedding space. The relation with the Poincar e coordinates is t , x , y , U V . If we define the vectors l 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 2 3 4 3 4 1 2 1 2 2 4 2 4 1 3 1 3 i 2 4 2 4 1 3 1 3 , U V T X Y , where the index , . . ., 5 is an SO 3,2 index raised and lowered using the metric , then a 3 4 3 4 1 2 1 2 2 0 , and the invariant b for the Killing spinors reads Xa a il 2 p a a . 17Note that this does not hold for 3, whose time dependence is not of the form derived in section 4.4. There is no contradiction however, since all solutions in this class have . It is interesting to find that nevertheless the time dependence of many Killing spinors in this class have the canonical G0 time dependence. 40 This form of b is manifestly invariant under the AdS4 isometries, and shows that under a transforms in the fundamental representation of SO 3,2 under these transforma tions. Note that it has precisely the same form as in the anti Nariai case. Again, the explicit knowledge of the AdS4 isometry group action on the Killing spinors is important to study the supersymmetry of its quotients. 5.1.3 The Reissner Nordstr om Taub NUT AdS4 family The last subcase corresponds to the vanishing of the third factor of the integrability condition . Note that this is precisely the expression in square brackets of equation and the condition reads simply 0. Then is an harmonic function and the transverse space is flat. In particular, the solution admits a second Killing spinor if . Since 0 we can define Im and Im . Moreover, all equations are invariant under rigid translations in the z directions, since the coordinate z never appears explicitly in them. One can use this freedom to eliminate the real part of by performing the redefinition z 7 z 1 2Re .

Chunk: ae1 with a 1 leads to AdS4. Also note that the 1 entry must be empty since any time like spinor plus 1 e1 leads to maximal supersymmetry, while all other Killing spinors come in groups of four. The only remaining entries are U or . Using the results of , it is straightforward to show that in these purely gravitational timelike cases the geometry is given by dt 2n cosh d 2 l2dz2 z2 n2 z2 n2 d 2 sinh2 d 2 , where l 2. But this is simply AdS4 written as a line bundle over a three dimensional base manifold, so both . We conclude that there are no 1 2 supersymmetric gravitational solutions in the gauged theory, only the 1 4 supersymmetric Lobatchevski waves and maximally supersymmetric AdS4. We now come to the general supersymmetric solutions in the gauged case. Due to the gauging and flux terms, neither 012 nor 3 commute with D . Therefore we have the cases as listed in table 5. The supercovariant connection in the gauged case has generalized holonomy GL 4, C , again consistent with the supersymmetries coming in doublets. The 1 4 BPS solutions with U were derived in , and we will show there is no solution with . In addition, it was shown in that any additional supersymmetries in the null case are always timelike, i.e. end up in the 1 entry. Again, the R2 entry is empty. It would be interesting to see if there is a nice explanation for this. In addition, the maximally supersymmetric case is always AdS4. Recently, it has been shown in that the 1 entry is empty as well, because imposing three complex Killing spinors implies that the spacetime is AdS4 and thus maximally supersymmetric. 9 R2 U I Table 5 General solutions with G invariant Killing spinors in the gauged theory. Check marks indicate entries with actual solutions, while circles stand for allowed entries which are not realized. The most general 1 2 BPS solution in the timelike case remains an open issue and will be studied in this paper. 2.4 Generalized holonomy In minimal gauged supergravity theories with eight supercharges, the generalized holon omy group for vacua preserving N supersymmetries, where , 2, 4, 6, 8, is GL 8 N 2 , C N 2 C 8 N 2 . To see this, assume that there exists a Killing spinor o 1. By a local GL 4, C transformation, o 1 can be brought to the form o 1, 0, 0, 0 T. This is annihilated by matrices of the form 0 aT 0 A , that generate the affine group A 3, C GL 3, C C3. Now impose a second Killing spinor o o 0 2, o 2 T. Acting with the stability subgroup of o 1 yields eAo o 0 2 bTo 2 eAo 2 , where eA 1 . We can choose A gl 3, C such that eAo 1, 0, 0 T, and b such that o 0 2 bTo . This means that the stability subgroup of o 1 can be used to bring o 2 to the form o 0, 1, 0, 0 . The subgroup of A 3, C that stabilizes also o 2 consists of the matrices 1 0 b2 b3 0 1 B12 B13 0 0 B22 B23 0 0 B32 B33 GL 2, C 2C2 . Finally, imposing a third Killing spinor yields GL 1, C 3C as maximal generalized holonomy group, which is however not realized in , 10 supergravity . It would be interesting to better understand why such preons actually do not exist. In section 4.3, we explicitely compute the generalized holonomy group for , 2 and show that it is indeed contained in A 3, C , supporting thus the classification scheme of . 3.

Chunk: will analyse the conditions coming from a single null Killing spinor. As we saw in section 2.1, there are two orbits of such spinors, one with representative o 1 and stability subgroup 1 ae1 and . Owing to local U gauge invariance, it is always possible to choose the function a real and positive, so in the following we set , R. The Killing spinor equations become i lA 1 2 e 2 1 l i E 2iF E 0 , d i lA 1 2 e 2 1 l i E 2iF E 0 , e 2 2iF E 1 l i E 0 , e 2 2iF E 1 l i E 0 , where F F and . The conditions for the special U R2 orbit with o 1 can be obtained as the singular limit of the above equations. Note however that, in this limit, the second line implies the constraint l 1 i 0, while the fourth line leads to l 1 i 0. Clearly, for l 1 0 this does not allow for a solution. Hence, in the gauged theory, there are no backgrounds with U R2 invariant Killing spinors. The only null possibility is therefore given by the R2 invariant Killing spinor o 1 e e1. We will now analyse the above conditions for the generic case with finite. In fact, we will furthermore assume it is positive. This does not constitute any loss of generality since one can flip the sign of by changing chirality a spinor 1 e e1 with negative is gauge equivalent to a spinor e1 e 1 with positive , and hence the resulting background will not depend on this sign. From the last two equations one obtains the constraints F F 0 , i ltanh 11 on the field strength, as well as 1 2lcosh E for the spin connection. implies F 0 and F i ltanh . The first two equations of yield then 2e H3E 1 l e2 cosh E1 , 2i sinh H1E i l cosh 2 cosh E3 , H1E sinh E3 , d 2 cosh H3E 2 lsinh E1 , where E E 2, E E 2, and we defined F F , F F . In order to proceed, we distinguish two subcases, namely d 0 and d 0. 3.1 Constant Killing spinor, are constant, eqn. implies . Next we impose vanishing torsion. The torsion two form reads , T dE E1 1 E l 3 E3 , T 1 E l , T 3 E . From 0, so by Fr obenius theorem there exist two functions and u such that locally du . Plugging this into d log 2 lE1 , 12 so that there exists a function such that d du . The gauge field and its field strength can now be written as H1du , du , and the Bianchi identity dH1 3 2H1d log . This means that H1 3 2 can depend only on u, H1 3 u l , where the prefactor and the derivative were chosen in order to conform with the notation of . Let us define a new coordinate 1 2, so that du, x u du . One can now use part of the residual gauge freedom, given by the stability subgroup R2 of the null spinor 1 ae1, in order to simplify E1. To this end, consider an R2 transformation with group element 1 X Y , where X and Y are given in . Defining i , this can also be written as 1 .

Chunk: energy fields that satisfy equations . We designate by I the identity operator on H0 . We have that, COROLLARY 5.4. . Proof This follows from Corollary 5.3. Again, the fact that S is the identity operator on H0 means that there is cloaking for all frequencies. In Theorem 7.1 of cloaking is proven for all frequencies with respect to the Cauchy data of the finite energy solutions that they define in Definition 4.1 and furthermore, in Theorem 8.2, they prove cloaking for all frequencies with the SHS boundary condition with respect to the Cauchy data of the finite energy solutions that they define in Definition 8.1. Theorem 3.1 remains true in the case of the cylinder. The proof is the same. Furthermore, all the remarks about finite energy solutions, and cloaking and that we made in Sections 2, 3, are true in the case of a cylinder. We do not repeat them here. Moreover, equations hold. However, since now the transformation only acts on the plane orthogonal to the axis of the cylinder equations has to be replaced by E , H , in K , where E E1, E2 , H H1, H2 . As in Section 4 we define solutions to 4.1, 4.2 with locally finite energy as solutions that are locally in the domain of A , that is to say that they are given by E H U E0 H0 28 with E0, H0 T locally in the domain of A0, i.e., E0, H0 T are in the domain of A0 when multiplied by any function in C 0 R3 . It follows from that the solutions with locally finite energy have to satisfy the boundary condition, E , H , in K . Note that is the SHS boundary condition considered in . We have proven here that is the only self adjoint boundary condition on K allowed by energy conserva tion.

Note, furthermore, that H0ac H0 . 18 3 Electromagnetic Waves Inside the Cloaked Objects Let us now consider the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the cloaked objects. For this purpose we assume that in each Kj the permittivity and the permeability are given by j , j , with inverses j , j and where j, j are the matrices with entries j , j . Furthermore, we assume that j , j C, x Kj and that for any compact set Q con tained in the interior of Kj there is a positive constant CQ such that det , det , x Q. In other words, we only allow for possible singularities of j, j on the boundary of Kj. We designate by HjE the Hilbert space of all measurable, C3 valued functions defined on Kj that are square integrable with the weight j , with the scalar product, E j , E j jE Z Kj E j j E j dx3. Similarly, we denote by HjH the Hilbert space of all measurable, C3 valued functions defined on Kj that are square integrable with the weight j , with the scalar product, H j , H j jH Z Kj H j j H j dx3. The Hilbert space of finite energy fields in Kj is the direct sum Hj HjE HjH, and the Hilbert space in the cloaked objects K is the direct sum, HK N . The complete Hilbert space of finite energy fields including the cloaked objects is, H H HK. We now write as a Schr odinger equation in each Kj as before. We define the 19 following formal differential operator, aj Ej Hj i j Hj j Ej . Equation in Kj is equivalent to i t Ej Hj aj Ej Hj . Let us denote by C1 0 Kj the set of all C6 valued continuously differentiable functions on Kj that have compact support in the interior of Kj, that we denote by Kj Kj Kj. Then, aj with domain C1 0 Kj is a symmetric operator in Hj. We denote, a a N , with domain, D a E H N Ej Hj C1 0 N Kj . The operator a is symmetric in H. The possible unitary dynamics that preserve energy for the whole system including the cloaked objects K are given by the self adjoint extensions of a. Let us denote a the closure of a, with similar notation for a , aj, , , N. Then, N , where we used the fact that as a is essentially self adjoint, a A . The adjoint of a is given by, D a E H N Ej Hj H E H D A , aj Ej Hj Hj , and a E H N Ej Hj A E H N Ej Hj , for E H N Ej Hj D a . 20 Let us denote by K kernel i a , Kj kernel i a j the deficiency subspaces of a and aj, , , N. Since a is essentially self adjoint K . Let K N be the deficiency subspaces of aK N . Suppose that K have the same dimension. Then, it follows from Corollary 1 in page 141 of that there is a one to one correspondence between self adjoint extensions of aK and unitary maps from K into K . If V is such a unitary, then the corresponding self adjoint extension AKV is given by, D AKV , and AK aK i iV . Hence, since K and aK there is a one to one correspondence between self adjoint extensions of a and unitary

Chunk: transferred to the case of a derivable approximation. This also implies that other Fermi liquid properties, such as the linear trend of the specific heat at low T and Fermi liquid expressions for the derivable approximation. There is a perturbation expansion5,7 which gives the Luttinger Ward functional U G in terms of closed skeleton diagrams see Fig. 1 . As a manageable FIG. 1 Diagrammatic representation of the Luttinger Ward functional U G . Double lines stand for the interacting one particle Green s function G, dashed lines represent the ver tices U. 2 derivable approximation must specify a universal func tional U G that can be evaluated in practice, one usu ally considers truncations of the expansion and sums up a certain subclass of skeleton diagrams only. This, how ever, means that the construction of conserving approx imations is restricted to the weak coupling limit. One purpose of the present paper is to show that it is possible to construct derivable approximations for lat tice models of correlated fermions with local interactions which are non perturbative, i.e. do not employ trunca tions of the skeleton diagram expansion. The idea is to employ the self energy functional theory SFT .8,9,10 The SFT constructs the Luttinger Ward functional U G , or its Legendre transform FU , in an indirect way, namely by making contact with an exactly solvable reference sys tem. Thereby, the exact functional dependence of FU becomes available on a certain subspace of self energies which is spanned by the self energies generated by the reference system. The obvious question is whether those non perturbative derivable approximations have the same properties as the weak coupling derivable ap proximations suggested by Baym and Kadanoff. This requires the discussion of the following points i Macroscopic conservations laws. For fermionic lat tice models, conservation of energy, particle number and spin have to be considered. Besides the static thermody namics, the SFT concept concentrates on the one particle excitations. For the approximate one particle Green s function, however, it is actually simple to prove that the above conservation laws are respected. A short discus sion is given in Appendix A. ii Thermodynamical consistency. This issue has al ready been addressed in Ref. 11. It has been shown that the derivative of the approximate SFT grand poten tial including a minus sign equals the average particle number as obtained by the trace of the approxi mate Green s function. The same holds for any one particle quantity coupling linearly via a parameter to the Hamiltonian, e.g. for the average total spin coupling via a field of strength B. iii Luttinger sum rule. This is the main point to be discussed in the present paper. There are different open questions First, it is straightforward to prove that weak coupling derivable approximations respect the sum rule as one can directly take over the proof for the exact theory. For approximations constructed within the SFT, a different proof has to be given. Second, it turns out that a non perturbative derivable approximation respects the sum rule if and only if the sum rule holds for the reference system that is used within the SFT. As the original and thereby the related reference system may be studied in the strong coupling regime, this raises the question which reference system does respect the sum rule, i.e. which approximation is consistent with the sum rule. Third, it will be particularly interesting to study reference systems which generate dynamical impurity ap proximations DIA 8,9 and variational cluster approxi mations VCA ,10,12 as these consist of a finite number of degrees of freedom. Does the Luttinger sum rule hold for finite systems? Do the DIA and the VCA respect the sum rule? What is the simplest approximation consistent with the sum rule? Note that finite reference systems consist ing of a few sites only have been shown9,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 to generate approximations which

Dashed line difference between the filling n and the average occupation of the correlated impurity site in the reference system at stationarity for the two site DIA. dynamical impurity approximation exactly fulfills the Luttinger sum rule. In Fig. 4 this can be seen by compar ing with the DOS of the non interacting system dashed lines . The non interacting DOS cuts the interacting one at 0 which shows that Eq. is satisfied. Note that this is trivial for . Offhalf filling, however, the pinning of the DOS to its non interacting value at 0 is a consequence of derivability and thereby a highly non trivial feature.

Note that, unlike the DMFT and also unlike the simplified 2S DMFT, the two site DIA predicts a fill ing which slightly differs from the average occupation of the correlated impurity site in the reference system see dashed line in Fig. 5 . For a finite number of bath sites ns this appears to be necessary to fulfill the Luttinger sum rule. The figure also shows the result obtained within the Hubbard I approximation.34 Here a very strong ar tificial violation of up to 100 for n close to half filling is obtained. This should be considered as a strong draw back which is typical for uncontrolled mean field approx imations. There are more relations which, analogously to the Luttinger sum rule, can be derived by means of per turbation theory to all orders6 in the exact theory and which are respected by weak coupling conserving approx imations. For example, the compressibility, defined as n , can be shown to be related to the interact ing DOS and the self energy at the Fermi edge via 2 1 . Fig. 6 shows that for the 2S DMFT it makes a difference whether is calculated as the derivative of the filling or via Eq. . Again, this must be attributed to the fact that the 2S DMFT is not a derivable approxima tion. Contrary, the two site DIA does respect the general Fermi liquid property and thus yields the same re sult in both cases see Fig. 6 . V. VIOLATION OF LUTTINGER S SUM RULE IN FINITE SYSTEMS The preceding section has demonstrated that the two site DIA satisfies the Luttinger sum rule. According to Eq. , we can conclude that the Luttinger sum rule must hold for the corresponding reference system, i.e. for the two site single impurity Anderson model. Of course, this can be verified more directly by evaluating Eq. . In case of a finite system or a system with reduced trans lational symmetries, the Green s function is a matrix with elements G where refers to the one particle basis states, and the Luttinger sum rule reads X k,m k m k m X k,m k m X

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0250v1 cond mat.str el 2 Apr 2007 2D MIT as self doping of a Wigner Mott insulator S. Pankov V. Dobrosavljevic National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL 32306 Abstract We consider an interaction driven scenario for the two dimensional metal insulator transition in zero magnetic field 2D MIT , based on melting the Wigner crystal through vacancy interstitial pair formation. We show that the transition from the Wigner Mott insulator to a heavy Fermi liquid emerges as an instability to self doping, resembling conceptually the solid to normal liquid transition in He3. The resulting physical picture naturally explains many puzzling features of the 2D MIT. Key words Strong correlation disorder metal insulator transition Hubbard model PACS 71.27. a, 72.15.Rn, 71.30. h A series of fascinating experiments, as first performed some ten years ago by Kravchenko and co workers , have deeply changed our thinking about the two dimensional electron gas 2DEG . These and many later experiments demonstrated convincingly that the 2DEG can exhibit typ ical metallic behavior above a well defined critical den sity nc. One of the most prominent features of this metallic phase is an unprecedented resistivity drop, which is found only in the low density regime n nc close to the tran sition. These findings suggested that a well defined metal insulator transition MIT may exist even in two dimen sions, in contrast to long held beliefs based on the theories for noninteracting disordered electrons. These experiments are typically performed at such low electron density where the relative strength of the Coulomb interaction is so large rs 10 , that the localization pro cesses could conceivably be suppressed by interaction ef fects. A diffusion mode theory describing such interaction renormalizations at weak disorder has been developed by Finkelshtein and Punnoose , suggesting that sufficiently strong interactions may indeed stabilize the metallic phase. However, this theory can provide guidance only within a narrow diffusive regime restricted to very low temperatures. In contrast, the most striking experimental results have been established in a broad parameter range well outside this regime, and are most pronounced in the cleanest sam ples . In particular, the best established experimental sig nature of the transition relies on careful effective mass mea surements, which is found to diverges as m n nc 1, Corresponding author email pankov magnet.fsu.edu 1 1.05 1.1 1.002 1 0.998 0.996 W Fig. 1. Evolution of the free energy profile W , as the electron density is increased across the MIT from top to bottom . The cusp corresponds to the Wigner solid. The self doped transition blue line takes place before the instability emerges at half filling 0, orange line and the Wigner insulating state is replaced by a heavy Fermi liquid. while the Lande g factor remains largely unrenormalized. Such phenomena cannot be understood within a low energy diffusion mode theory, which relies on Anderson localiza tion to produce an insulating phase. A fundamental question is thus posed by these experi ments what is the basic mechanism that drives the metal insulator transition in these systems? Does one have to rely on disorder effects at all in the zero th order approximation, or can one understand the most important experimental features by interaction effects alone? In this work, we con centrate solely on the effects of strong Coulomb interactions in the clean limit, and try to establish which experimental Preprint submitted to Elsevier 17 January 2014 features can be explained by entirely ignoring the disorder. We approach the transition from the insulating side, starting with the Wigner Mott insulator, and examine its melting by quantum fluctuations as density increases. These are believed to be dominated by the vacancy interstitial pair excitations on top of the classical triangu lar lattice configuration. Within the Wigner crystal, the electrons are tightly bound, and the vacancy interstitial excitations can be well represented by a mapping to

Chunk: Now, ij see Proposition 3 we have X i,j X Y . That is, we proved that if U AB is maximally entangled then the map is an isometry. For the converse we note that we have an isometry of Cd onto U AB given by T w dB X w ei . Now, if the map defined in the proposition is an isometry X Y . That is, X i, X Y , for all X, Y End HB . Hence, we must ij and from Proposition 3 the subspace U AB is maximally entangled. C. Additivity of maximally entangled subspaces We now discuss the additivity properties of maximally entangled subspaces. 5 Proposition 6. Let U AB HA HB and V A B HA HB be maximally entangled subspaces. Then, E U AB V A B E U AB E V A B log m log m , where m min and m min . Remark. From the above proposition it follows that if dA dB and dA dB or dB dA and dB dA then U AB V A B is maximally entangled in HA HA HB HB . However, if for example dB then U AB V A B is NOT maximally entangled in HA HA HB HB because mm min . Proof. There are basically two possibilities up to inter changing factors the first is dA dB and dA dB , and the second is dA dB and dA dB . In the first case we have as in the statement of proposition 3 the subspaces Uj and the unitaries Tj Cd Uj such that U P i Tiw ei w Cd . We also have the orthonormal basis fi of HB , the sub spaces Vj and the unitaries Sj Cd Vj such that V A B P i Siw fi w Cd . Thus, as a subspace of HA HA HB HB , U AB V A B is spanned by the elements X i,j Tiw Sjw ei fj . Thus if we identify Cd Cd with Cdd then the converse assertion in proposition 3 implies that U AB V A B is a maximally entangled space. This implies that E U AB V A B log dB log dB log m log m . We now consider the second case. For U AB we have ex actly as above U P i Tiw ei w Cd . For V A B we denote by fj an orthonormal basis of HA not of HB as above . Thus, according to proposition 3 we have V A B P i fi Siw w Cd . As a subspace of HA HA HB HB , U AB V A B is spanned by the elements X i,j Tiw fj ei Sjw . We will assume first that d d. Let w 1, ..., w d be an orthonormal basis of Cd . Thus, if is a state in U AB V A B we can write it as X i,j,k Tiwk fj ei Sjw k , where wk are some non normalized vectors in Cd. Fur thermore, dBdA X k uk 2 . Hence, if is normalized then X k uk . Now, since Sjw k is an orthonormal set of vectors for all j and k see proposition 3 , the entanglement of as an element of HA HA HB HB is given by dBdA S B where 1 i,j d , and if 1, ..., d are the eigenvalues of B then the von Neumann entropy of B is S B X i log i . Now B is the most general d d self adjoint, positive semidefinate matrix with trace 1 dBdA . The minimum of the entropy for such matrices is log dadB dadB . This proves the proposition for the case d d. If then we can prove the proposition by

Chunk: using the same argument, this time with wk an orthonormal basis of Cd and with B w i w j 1 i,j d. This completes the proof. The above proposition also shows that the entangle ment of formation is additive for bipartite states with maximally entangled support. If is a mixed state in HA HB then the entanglement of formation is defined in terms of the convex roof extension EF min X piE i where the minimum taken over all decompositions X pi i i with i a pure bipartite state and 1. Corollary 7. Let and be mixed states in B HA HB and B HA HB , respectively. If the support subspaces S and S are maximally entangled then EF EF EF . The proof of this corollary follows directly from the fact that for states with maximally entangled support EF E S . Note that the class of mixed states with maximally entangled support is extremely small i.e. of measure zero . In particular, it is a much smaller class than the one found by Vidal, Dur and Cirac . 6 III. ERROR CORRECTING CODES A. Definitions We consider error correcting codes that are used to en code l qubits in n l qubits in such a way that they can correct errors on any subset of k or fewer qubits. These codes, which we call n, l, k error correcting codes, can be classified into two classes for example see de generate and non degenerate or orthogonal codes. We start with a general definition of error correcting codes that is equivalent to the definition given for example in , but here we define the codes in terms of sub spaces. Definition 4. Let X End kC2 and 0 ... ik 1 n 1. The operator Xi0i1 ik 1 on nC2, that represents the errors on the k qubits i1, ..., ik 1, is defined by Xi0...ik X I 1v, where a Sn acting on by permutations is defined such that j ij, b can act on nC2 by v0 v1 vn 1 v v v n 1 and c nC2 is viewed as kC2 n kC2 putting together the k tensor factors that correspond to the k qubits i1, ..., ik 1 and the rest n k tensor factors . An n, l, k error correcting code is defined from its following ingredients I. An isometry T lC2 nC2. II. Let lC2 . There are V1, ..., Vd mutually orthogonal subspaces of nC2 that are also orthogonal to V0. III. For each Vj there is a unitary isomorphism, Uj, of Vj onto V0 with . IV. Xi0i1 ik 1V0 d . V. Let Pj be the ortogonal projection of nC2 onto Vj then if v V0 is a unit vector and Pj Xi0i1 ik 1v 0 then Uj Pj Xi0i1 ik 1v Pj Xi0i1 ik 1v equals v up to a phase. In the next subsection we study Shor s 9, 1, 1 error correcting code and show that it satisfies this definition. However, before that, let us introduce the notion of k totally entangled subspaces which will play an important role in our discussion of QECC. Definition 5. Let H be the space of n qubits, nC2. Corresponding to any choice of k qubits tensor factors we can consider n kC2 and . For k n 2 we will say that a subspace, V , of H is k totally entangled if it is maximally entangled relative to every decomposition of H as above. It is interesting to note that all the subspaces spanned by the logical codewords of the different non degenerate error correcting codes given in are 2 totally entangled subspaces. On the other hand, the subspaces spanned by the logical codewords of degenerate codes, like Shor s 9 qubits code, are in general only partially maximally entangled subspaces i.e. maximally entan gled

Chunk: diagram for Serpens are located in one of the two principal clusters, A and B, in Serpens, it is perhaps not surprising that they would mimic some of the properties of similar young clusters like NGC 1333. 3.5. The Most Embedded Objects We have selected the coldest, most obscured sources from our sample by looking for objects not detected in the 2MASS survey but detected with reasonable signal to noise at both 24 and 70 m. There are 11 such objects in our surveyed area, and these are listed in Table 6. Interestingly all 11 are located in the heart of either Cluster A or B. Additionally, as shown in Table 6 all were detected in some or all IRAC bands. Their energy distributions are all consistent with a designation of Class I even though they are not included in Figure 7 since they were not detected in the 2MASS survey. In fact, several of these objects are strongly enough peaked in the far infrared that they have energy distributions consistent with some nominal Class 0 sources despite the fact that all were detected with IRAC. The class status of these will be discussed further using mm data by Enoch et al. 2007, in prep. . Figure 10 shows the SED s for the two most embedded objects from Table 6. Each of these appears to be associated with an outflow in its respective cluster, and both have very similar SED s that differ only in their absolute flux level by a factor of 10. Table 6 shows also that the most embedded object in Cluster B whose SED is shown in Figure 10 was not selected as a YSO by Harvey et al. . The reason is that the flux at 3.6 m was too faint to meet the selection criteria of that study. The area within 15 of that source contains two other extracted compact sources in the c2d data set. The positions and photometry for all three are shown in Table 7 and an image of the area is shown in Figure 11. Although the source density is quite high, the 70 m contours shown in the figure are clearly centered on the northernmost source, C . Source B is a slightly extended source that may represent a separate exciting object or may just be the location of the most visible jet emission that has been discussed briefly by Harvey et al. in this region. Source A is a faint, but very red object about 6 to the west of source C and appears to be a point like object in the images. 10 Figure 4 shows clearly that Cluster A and B are located in the highest extinction parts of the cloud. Therefore the lack of detection of the objects in Table 6 at 1 2.3 m may be due at least partly to the extinction of the cloud material in which they are embedded in addition to individual circumstellar material. Although the nominal extinction values in these areas range up to Av 35 40, the fact that these values result from smoothing over 90 arcseconds of the stellar distribution means that they probably underestimate the extinction in the most extreme regions. This association of the coldest objects with the highest extinction regions is similar to the correlation seen by Enoch et al. between extinction and location of dense mm cores. 4. Summary We have described the basic observational characteristics of the c2d MIPS observations of the Serpens Cloud. In a 1.5 deg2 area we have found 250 YSO candidates on the basis of the Ks color. An additional 11 objects can be identified on the basis of their 24 and 70 m fluxes and lack of detection by 2MASS. All of these YSO candidates will be discussed in more detail in a companion paper Harvey et al. 2007 . All the most embedded objects are

Chunk: panel of Fig. 7 that the pure SUSY and UED cos bb spectrum are quite different.

For instance, the asymmetry is 0.282 0.019 for SUSY and 0.200 0.019 for UED and this extremely large luminosity. In this case SUSY and UED can be discriminated only at at 4 level. Therefore, it is important for this point to subtract the SM background which can be estimated, for instance, from the measurement of the b b cross section. If we neglect systematic errors associated to this extraction from data, the sbottom spin can be determined at 5 level for an integrated luminosity of 500 fb 1. The left panel of Fig. 7 displays the distributions of SUSY and UED after a naive background subtraction where we just did not add the background to the signals and the error bars calculated as S B. A dedicated study is necessary to determine the actual impact of the statistical and systematic errors . In general, we noticed that the expected shape of distributions in cos bb are similar to the ones in smuon pair production and decay to 0 1 , which shows the universality and robustness of the method. Moreover, in both cases b sbx and the S5 spectrum seems to be more promising as compared to the SPS1a spectrum, for example, SUSY versus UED discrimination of smuon spin assignments is possible in the case of S5 SPS1a for an integrated luminosity of 200 fb 1 500 fb 1 . As a final remark note that, apart from negligible effects from b b initiated contributions which include interactions with gluinos and electroweak interactions with Z bosons, the production rate does not depend upon the left or right nature of the sbottom since the QCD interactions to the gluons are blind to these details. On the other hand, the sbottom bottom neutralino vertex is sensitive to the relative content of mass eigenstates in terms of left and right states which by its turn depend upon the mass spectrum. As we have pointed out in the Section III the lightest 9 sbottom is almost pure right-handed while the lighter sbottom is almost pure left-handed.

Chunk: is a less than adequate fit, so these are difficult to explain solely as due to telluric atmospheric absorption effects. 3.2. AFGL 5440 For AFGL 5440 a quick glance at the observed light curves Figure 5 indicated that a single source size was unlikely to fit over the entire 1 4 m bandwidth Harvey Wilson 2003 . This suggests that we are seeing the combination of the emission from the central star and a circumstellar shell of material due to mass loss from the star. To demonstrate the poor fit with a single size uniform disk, we show in Figures 5 and 6 the results of trying to fit the data with one example uniform disk, 11 mas. As can be seen in the plots of 2 as well as the observed versus model light curves, the 11 mas disk provides a passable fit in the mid range of wavelengths, 2.5 3.2 m, but produces fringes that are too sharp at the longer wavelengths and too broadened at the shortest wavelengths. This result motivated us to pursue a full radiative transfer model for the object that could be used to compare both the size constraints provided by our occultation data and the spectral energy distribution Guandalini et al. 2006 which contains important and different information about the relative amount of dust at different temperatures. The DUSTY code 7 Ivezi c, Nenkova Elitzur 1999 was originally created, in fact, for modeling the emission from AGB stars surrounded by mass loss shells. Its output includes model source images as well as the total energy distribution, so it is ideal for our purposes. Our approach to using the code was to choose a particular combination of input parameters and then vary the dust optical depth to find the best fit to the energy distribution for those parameters. We then used the output source images that were computed as a function of wavelength to calculate expected occultation fringes for the model and compared those to the observed fringes. Since AFGL 5440 has been classified as a carbon rich star, we assumed a carbon rich dust composition, typically some combination of amorphous carbon, silicon carbide, and graphite as the major constituents. The other critical parameters for the models are the dust temperature at the inner radius and the radial density gradient. The outer radius of the dust shell makes essentially no difference to the observed characteristics at 60 m as long as it is at least 100 times the inner radius. The goal of our modeling was to find some reasonable fit to our occultation data and the rough spectral energy distribution for the circumstellar dust shell we have not attempted to extract details of the stellar photosphere or attempt a thorough examination of all possible dust size composition models since our data do not bear directly on those issues for reasons of wavelength coverage and spectral resolution. In particular, we did not try to find any better than superficial agreement with the IRAS LRS data. We explored more than 200 models to understand the effect of varying the input pa rameters on the quality of the fit. Basically all the models that provided an approximate fit to the occultation observations and the spectral energy distribution had several features in common. First, the dust temperature at the inner radius of the dust shell was of order 950K 50K. Models with a maximum dust temperature below 900 K did not have enough hot dust to fit the occultation fringes at the longer wavelengths, while models with hotter inner edges had even more difficulty than the best fit model in reproducing the energy distribu tion longward of 10 m. Secondly, the radial density gradient of models with a reasonable fit was close to r 2 or to DUSTY s calculation of the gradient appropriate for a radiatively driven wind which approximates an r 2 distribution for large

Chunk: radii . Models with a density gradient of r 1.8 came closer to producing the IRAS 60 m flux, but did not fit the shape of the 5 20 m energy distribution well. Models with a density gradient of r 2.2 can fit the energy distribution out to 20 m and also provide a good fit to the occultation results, but have substantially worse fits to the IRAS 60 m flux than our best fit models. The optical depth for best fit at the fiducial wavelength of 5 m was typically in the range 0.3 0.6. Finally, the dust composition that provided the best fit included a small amount of SiC together with comparable amounts of amorphous carbon and graphite. Other carbon rich compositions produced reasonable fits except at the longest wavelengths or in the 11 m SiC 8 feature. Note that there is a range of optical properties for different forms of amorphous car bon Andersen, Liodl, Hofner 1999 that we did not explore. We experimented with two grain size distributions, the MRN slope Mathis, Rumpl Nordsieck 1977 , and another, the KMH shape Kim, Martin Hendry 1994 , used by Ivezi c Elitzur for models of IRC 10216, that has a smoother fall offon each end. We found that we could obtain reasonably good fits with either distribution. Figures 7 and 8 show the fits to the spectral energy distribution and to the occultation light curves for the best fit model. Figure 9 shows the quality of the fit versus wavelength, and figure 10 illustrates the spatial profiles of this best fit model. Figures 11 and 12 likewise show for comparison the fits for a model discussed below that does not use any graphite. Finally, figures 13 and 14 show results for a third model that fits the energy distribution but gives a poor fit to the occultation results because of a lack of enough warm dust close to the star. 4. Discussion and Summary Model dust shells have been computed for a number of carbon rich AGB stars by various authors. Le Bertre, Gougeon, Le Sidaner and Le Bertre found that the energy distributions for nearly two dozen carbon rich stars could be modelled with very similar dust shell parameters. They found a common value of maximum dust temperature of order 950 K with shell density gradient of r 2 for spherically symmetric shells. The best fit dust property implied a dust emissivity, o 1.3, consistent with that expected for an amorphous carbon rich dust composition as also found by Jura . These conclusions were enhanced by their ability to fit the energy distributions over a range of phases of the observed variability of many of the stars. On the other hand, Suh suggested that a superwind phase of mass loss could improve model fits to the energy distributions for a number of carbon rich AGB dust shells by enhancing the emission shortward of 30 m because of a high rate of mass loss in recent times, e.g. at small radii where most of the emission would be due to hotter dust. Ivezi c Elitzur used a self consistent radiatively driven hydrodynamic model for the density distribution around IRC 10216 and were able to fit both the spectral energy distribution and the near infrared angular visibility data from speckle observations. Interestingly they derived an inner dust shell temperature substantially lower than ours and most other studies, 750K. Winters et al. computed a full time dependent model of periodic outflow from AFGL 3068 and were able to produce a good fit to the energy distribution and observed light curves. Virtually all of these modeling efforts used dust emissivities appropriate for some form of amorphous carbon usually including SiC , but with no graphite see also Lorenz Martins 2001 , contrary to our best model fit above. The model of Ivezi c Elitzur utilized a grain size distribution that

Chunk: flow equations. Thus, the comparison presented here can help to estimate the quality of the calculations made so far to get n point functions at finite momenta neglecting high order vertices. The article is organized as follows. In the next section we describe the basics ingredients of both the NPRG and the approximation scheme introduced in . We also present the results obtained in , when this scheme is used to find the 2 point function of the scalar model. In section III, we apply the expansion in the field at various orders and compare these results with those found in . Finally, we present the conclusions of the study. II. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Let us consider a scalar field theory with the classical action 1 2 x 2 r 2 2 x u 4! 4 x . 4 Here, r and u are the microscopic mass and coupling, respectively. The NPRG builds a family of effective actions, where x J is the ex pectation value of the field in presence of an external source J x , in which the magnitude of long wavelength fluctuations are controlled by an infrared regulator depending on a con tinuous parameter . One can write for an exact flow equation 1 2 Z ddq 2 d R q2 R 1 q, q , where is the second functional derivative of with respect to x , and R denotes a family of cut offfunctions depending on R q behaves like 2 when q and it vanishes rapidly when q . The effective action interpolates between the classical action obtained for where 1 is the microscopic length scale , and the full effective action obtained when 0, i.e., when all fluctuations are taken into account see e.g. . By differentiating eq. with respect to x , and then letting the field be constant, one gets the flow equation for the n point function n in a constant background field . For example, for the 2 point function one gets p Z ddq 2 d Rk q n G q p, q, p q G q p p, p q, q G q 1 2G q p, p, q, q G q o , where G 1 q q, q R q2 , and we used the definition 2 d d X i pi ! n p1, . . . , pn Z ddx1 . . . Z ddxnei Pn n x1 . . . xn x . The flow equation for a given n point function involves the n 1 and n 2 point functions see, e.g., eq. , so that the flow equations for all correlation functions constitute an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations. In , a general method to solve this infinite hierarchy was proposed. It exploits the smoothness of the regularized n point functions, and the fact that the loop momentum q in 5 the right hand side of the flow equations such as eq. or eq. is limited to due to the presence of R q . The leading order of the method presented in thus consists in setting n p1, p2, ..., pn 1 q, pn q n p1, p2, ..., pn 1, pn in the r.h.s. of the flow equations. After making this approximation, some momenta in some of the n point functions vanish, and their expressions can then be obtained as derivatives of m point functions with respect to a constant background field. Specifically, in the flow equation for the 2 point function, eq. , after setting .h.s., the 3 and 4 point functions will contain one and two vanishing momenta, respectively. These can be related to the following derivatives of the 2 point function p, p, 0 p, p , p, p, 0, 0 2 p, p 2 . One then gets a closed equation for p p2 J d p, p, p !2 1 2I d 2

These choices enable a model Nep tune to reach a mass of 1 M in 50 Myr, when the largest KBOs form at 40 50 AU, and reach its current mass in 100 Myr3. As Neptune approaches its final mass, its gravity stirs up KBOs at 40 60 AU and increases their orbital eccentric ities to e 0.1 0.2 on short timescales. In the coagula tion model, distant planets produce negligible changes in i, so self stirring sets i in these calculations Weidenschilling 1989 .

By spreading the 3 This prescription is not intended as an accurate portrayal of Neptune for mation, but it provides a simple way to investigate how Neptune might stir the Kuiper belt once massive KBOs form. 7 6 7 8 9 10 log Time yr 2 1 0 log 0 Neptune Stirring SS 40 47 AU NS 40 47 AU NS 47 55 AU Fig. 5.

Figure 5 shows the evolution of the surface density in small and large KBOs in two annuli as a function of time. At 40 55 AU, Neptune rapidly stirs up KBOs to e 0.1 when it reaches its current mass at 100 Myr. Large collision velocities produce more debris, which is rapidly ground to dust and removed from the system by radiation pressure at early times and by Poynting Robertson drag at later times. Compared to self stirring models, the change in is dramatic, with only 3 of the initial disk mass remaining at 4.5 Gyr. From these initial calculations, it is clear that exter nal perturbations dramatically reduce the mass of KBOs in the disk see also Charnoz and Morbidelli 2007 . Fig ure 6 compares the mass distributions at 40 47 AU and at 4.5 Gyr for the self stirring model in Figure 2 solid line with results for the flyby dot dashed line and Neptune stir ring dashed line . Compared to the self stirring model, the close flyby reduces the mass in KBOs by 50 . Neptune stirring reduces the KBO mass by almost a factor of 3 rel ative to the self stirring model. For KBOs with r 30 50 km, the predicted mass in KBOs with Neptune stirring is within a factor of 2 3 of the current mass in KBOs. These simple calculations for the stellar flyby and Nep tune stirring do not include dynamical depletion. In the stel lar flyby picture, the encounter removes nearly all KBOs beyond a truncation radius, aT 48 aclose 160 AU AU Kenyon and Bromley 2004c .

However, the mass distribution at 40 47 AU in the Neptune stirring model is dramatically lower than in the self stirring model, and the mass distribution at 47 55 AU is much lower than in the flyby model, as seen in Figure 5.

Chunk: problem, the abundance of constraints has allowed for the development of reasonably consistent models. Here we briefly describe what is currently understood about the evolution of the asteroid belt, what insights that may give us with regards to the evolution of the Kuiper Belt, and what differences might exist in the evolution of the two popula tions. It has long been recognized that the primordial as teroid belt must have contained hundreds or thousands of times more mass than the current asteroid belt e.g. Lecar and Franklin 1973 Safronov 1979 Weidenschilling 1977c Wetherill 1989 . Reconstructing the initial mass distribution of the Solar System from the current masses of the planets and asteroids, for example, yields a pronounced mass deficiency in the asteroid belt region relative to an oth erwise smooth distribution for the rest of the Solar System Weidenschilling 1977c . To accrete the asteroids on the timescales inferred from meteoritic evidence would require hundreds of times more mass than currently exists in the main belt Wetherill 1989 . In addition to its pronounced mass depletion, the aster oid belt is also strongly dynamically excited. The mean proper eccentricity and inclination of asteroids larger than 50 km in diameter are 0.135 and 10.9o from the cata log of Kne zevi c and Milani , which are significantly larger than can be explained by gravitational perturbations amongst the asteroids or by simple gravitational pertur bations from the planets Duncan 1994 . The fact that the different taxonomic types of asteroids S type, C type, etc. are radially mixed somewhat throughout the main belt, rather than confined to delineated zones, indicates that there has been significant scattering in semimajor axis as well Gradie and Tedesco 1982 . Originally, a collisional origin was suggested for the mass depletion in the asteroid belt Chapman and Davis 1975 . The difficulty of collisionally disrupting the largest asteroids, coupled with the survival of the basaltic crust of the 500 km diameter asteroid Vesta, however, suggest that collisional grinding was not the cause of the mass deple tion Davis et al. 1979, 1985, 1989, 1994 Wetherill 1989 Durda and Dermott 1997 Durda et al. 1998 Bottke et al. 2005a,b O Brien and Greenberg 2005 . In addition, col lisional processes alone could not fully explain both the dy namical excitation and the radial mixing observed in the as teroid belt, although Charnoz et al. suggest that col lisional diffusion may have contributed to its radial mixing. Several dynamical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the mass depletion, dynamical excitation and radial mixing of the asteroid belt. As the solar nebula dissipated, the changing gravitational potential acting on Jupiter, Saturn, and the asteroids would lead to changes in their precession rates and hence changes in the posi tions of secular resonances, which could sweep through the asteroid belt, exciting e and i, and coupled with gas drag, could lead to semi major axis mobility and the re moval of material from the belt e.g., Heppenheimer 1980 Ward 1981 Lemaitre and Dubru 1991 Lecar and Franklin 1997 Nagasawa et al. 2000, 2001, 2002 . It has also been suggested that sweeping secular resonances could lead to orbital excitation in the Kuiper Belt Nagasawa and Ida 2000 . However, as reviewed by Petit et al. and O Brien et al. , secular resonance sweeping is gen erally unable to simultaneously match the observed e and i excitation in the asteroid belt, as well as its radial mix ing and mass depletion, for reasonable parameter choices especially in the context of the Nice Model . Another possibility is that planetary embryos were able to accrete in the asteroid belt e.g., Wetherill 1992 . The fact that Jupiter s 10 Earth mass core was able to accrete in our Solar System beyond the asteroid belt, suggests that such a process is not impossible, although it is unlikely that the same could occur in a typical star forming region . Regardless of the specifics of the accretion process, the net effect would be to remove material from the belt. This process, coupled with dynamical ejection of bodies from the asteroid belt e.g.

Chunk: has some pressure support, it orbits the star slightly more slowly than the Keplerian velocity. Thus, orbiting dust grains feel a headwind that drags them to ward the central star Adachi et al. 1976 Weidenschilling 1984 Tanaka and Ida 1999 . For m sized objects, the drag timescale at 40 AU, 105 yr, is comparable to the growth time. Thus, it is not clear whether grains can grow by di rect accretion to km sizes before the gas drags them into the inner part of the disk. Dynamical processes provide alternatives to random ag glomeration of grains. In ensembles of porous grains, gas flow during disruptive collisions leads to planetesimal for mation by direct accretion Wurm et al. 2004 . Analytic es timates and numerical simulations indicate that grains with r 1 cm are also easily trapped within vortices in the disk e.g. de la Fuente Marcos and Barge 2001 Inaba and Barge 2006 . Large enhancements in the solid to gas ratio within vortices allows accretion to overcome gas drag, enabling formation of km sized planetesimals in 104 105 yr. If the dusty midplane is calm, it becomes thinner and thinner until groups of particles overcome the local Jeans criterion where their self gravity overcomes local orbital shear and collapse into larger objects on the local dy namical timescale, 103 yr at 40 AU Goldreich and Ward 1973 Youdin and Shu 2002 Tanga et al. 2004 . This pro cess is a promising way to form planetesimals however, turbulence may prevent the instability Weidenschilling 1995, 2003, 2006 . Although the expected size of a col lapsed object is the Jeans wavelength, the range of plan etesimal sizes the instability produces is also uncertain. Once planetesimals with r 1 km form, gravity dom inates gas dynamics. Long range gravitational interactions exchange kinetic energy dynamical friction and angular momentum viscous stirring , redistributing orbital energy and angular momentum among planetesimals. For 1 km objects at 40 AU, the initial random velocities are compara ble to their escape velocities, 1 m s 1 Weidenschilling 1980 Goldreich et al. 2004 . The gravitational binding en ergy for brevity, we use energy as a shorthand for specific energy , Eg 104 erg g 1, is then comparable to the typ ical collision energy, Ec 104 erg g 1. Both energies are 2 smaller than the disruption energy the collision energy needed to remove half of the mass from the colliding pair of objects which is Q D 105 107 erg g 1 for icy mate rial Davis et al. 1985 Benz and Asphaug 1999 Ryan et al. 1999 Michel et al. 2001 Leinhardt and Richardson 2002 Giblin et al. 2004 . Thus, collisions produce mergers in stead of debris. Initially, small planetesimals grow slowly. For a large ensemble of planetesimals, the collision rate is n v, where n is the number of planetesimals, is the cross section, and v is the relative velocity. The collision cross section is the geometric cross section, r2, scaled by the gravitational focusing factor, fg, c r2fg r2 1 vesc evK 2 , where e is the orbital eccentricity, vK is the orbital ve locity, vesc is the escape velocity of the merged pair of planetesimals, and 2.7 is a coefficient that ac counts for three dimensional orbits in a rotating disk Greenzweig and Lissauer 1990 Spaute et al. 1991 Wetherill and Stewart 1993 . Because evK vesc, gravitational focusing factors are small and growth is slow and orderly Safronov 1969 . The timescale for slow, orderly growth is ts 30 r 0.1 km. However, gravitational scattering produces a wide range of initial velocities. As the velocity dispersion increases, the growth rate increases, until the collision rate becomes limited by the local density of objects and the growth rate plateaus. This plateau phase is the oligarchic growth phase. The transition from the slow growth to the oligarchic growth is sharp, and occurs near the distance at which the growth time is equal to the dynamical timescale. At 40 AU, the transition distance is at 103 105 m, and the size of objects at the transition is 102 103 km.

Chunk: Kenyon and Luu 1998 . For larger objects with r 0.1 km, the smaller objects damp the orbital eccentricity of larger particles through dynam ical friction Wetherill and Stewart 1989 Kokubo and Ida 1995 Kenyon and Luu 1998 .

For planetes imals with r 1 m to r 1 km, these processes occur on short timescales, 106 yr at 40 AU, and roughly bal ance when these objects have orbital eccentricity e 10 5.

Runaway growth relies on positive feedback between accretion and dynamical friction. Dynamical friction pro duces the largest fg for the largest objects, which grow faster and faster relative to the smaller objects and contain an ever growing fraction of the total mass. As they grow, these protoplanets stir the planetesimals. The orbital ve locity dispersions of small objects gradually approach the escape velocities of the protoplanets. With esvK vl,esc, collision rates decline as runaway growth continues eqs. and . The protoplanets and leftover planetesimals then enter the oligarchic phase, where the largest objects oligarchs grow more slowly than they did as runaway objects but still faster than the leftover planetesimals. The timescale to reach oligarchic growth is Lissauer 1987 Goldreich et al. 2004 to 30 P 250 yr 0.1 g cm 2 0d Myr , For the MMSN, to a 3. Thus, collisional damping, dynamical friction and gravitational focusing enhance the growth rate by 3 orders of magnitude compared to orderly growth. Among the oligarchs, smaller oligarchs grow the fastest. Each oligarch tries to accrete material in an annular feed ing zone set by balancing the gravity of neighboring oli garchs. If an oligarch accretes all the mass in its feed ing zone, it reaches the isolation mass Lissauer 1987 Kokubo and Ida 1998, 2002 Rafikov 2003a Goldreich et al. 2004 , miso 28 a 40 AU 3 0d 0.1 g cm 2 M . Each oligarch stirs up leftover planetesimals along its or bit. Smaller oligarchs orbit in regions with smaller l s. Thus, smaller oligarchs have larger gravitational focusing factors eqs. and and grow faster than larger oli garchs Kokubo and Ida 1998 Goldreich et al. 2004 . As oligarchs approach miso, they stir up the velocities of the planetesimals to the disruption velocity. Instead of mergers, collisions then yield smaller planetesimals and de bris. Continued disruptive collisions lead to a collisional cascade, where leftover planetesimals are slowly ground to dust Dohnanyi 1969 Williams and Wetherill 1994 . Ra diation pressure from the central star ejects dust grains with r 1 10 m Poynting Robertson drag pulls larger grains into the central star Burns et al. 1979 Artymowicz 1988 Takeuchi and Artymowicz 2001 . Eventually, plan etesimals with r 10 m are left. This is the final stage of planetesimal assembly.

Chunk: r k eikt, Fj A , be admissible, where Fj are uniquely determined by u r, t . Proof. By Proposition 1, 0 0 k Z ck Fj cje k . So the series P Fj r k eikt converges uniformly in the disk e and determines an infinitely differentiable function there. The direct check shows that the functions r2 1 j 1 P Fj r k eikt, , 2, . . ., m, satisfy in KR. Since 0 is arbitrary, these functions are solutions of the equation inside K. 2 To prove the necessity, suppose at first . Let u r, t be a harmonic function in K. Then for a fixed , u r, t is infinitely differentiable in t, and it may be written in the form u r, t X r eikt, ck r 1 2 2 Z 0 u r, t e ikt dt, where the series and all its derivatives converge uniformly in t 0, 2 . The coefficients ck r are infinitely differentiable on 0, 1 and satisfy the equation r2ck r rck r k2ck r . Hence, ck r r k ck, ck C. It follows from the convergence of the series in that k ck e k ck c, where ln . By Proposition 1, ck are the Fourier coefficients of a certain hyperfunction F1, and u r, t X k ck F1 eikt, F1 A . Thus, the representation is valid when . Assume the representation to be true for an m 1 harmonic inside K function u r, t m 2 , and we shall prove that such a representation holds for an m harmonic function. If u r, t is an m harmonic function, then u r, t is an m 1 harmonic one. By assumption, there exist Ej A , , 2, . . ., m 1, such that u r, t m 1 X r2 1 j 1 X Ej r k eikt. If we choose eu C2 K so that u r, t eu r, t 0, then, because of , we shall have u r, t eu r, t X k ck F1 eikt, F1 A . Let us find at first eu r, t in the case where the equation is of the form u r, t X k ck E1 eikt, E1 A . By using the identity r2 1 j X k ck F eikt ! 4j X r2 1 j 1 k j j 1 r2 1 j 2 r k ck F eikt 3 for F A , one can verify that the function eu2 r, t u2 r, t , where u2 r, t 1 4 r2 1 X k k 1ck E1 eikt eu1 r, t 0 , satisfies .

Chunk: as described by M04 . This argues for full N body simulations that would include the effects of SIDM with varying cross sections. Additionally, new data both X ray and lensing have become available for 1E 0657 56. Analysis of data from 450 ks of total exposure with Chandra gives a more accurate shock Mach number of .0 0.4 all uncertainties 68 , which corresponds to a shock and 4 bullet velocity of 4700 630 km s 1 Markevitch 2005 . Recent weak and strong lensing analyses of a much larger optical dataset, which includes HST observations, give a higher quality mass map and a more accurate determination of the subcluster dark matter and galaxy centroids Brada c et al. 2006, hereafter B06 C06 . In particular, the accuracy of the total mass and galaxy centroids is now sufficient for an additional method of constraining m. In this paper, we will concentrate on the most sensitive method from M04, which is based on the observed mass to light M L ratios, and on this new test. The best way to interpret the new high quality data is through comparisons with detailed numerical simula tions of the merger which allow for SIDM with varying cross sections. We present results from such simulations and give constraints on the self interaction cross section of dark matter particles. We assume .3, 0.7, and , for which 1 4.42 kpc at the cluster redshift of .296. 2. The Simulations 2.1. Simulation Code and Parameters All simulations were performed using a modified version of the publicly available TreeSPH code GADGET2 Springel 2005 . To model the self interaction of the DM particles, we adopted a Monte Carlo method used previously by other authors e.g., Burkert 2000 Yoshida et al. 2000b . At each simulation time step, the scattering probability for the ith particle is given by i vrel t, where i is the local density, vrel is the relative velocity between the ith particle and its nearest neighbor, and t is the time step size. The local density is determined using GADGET2 s smoothed particle hydrodynamic SPH capabilities. Collisions are assumed to be elastic and scattering isotropic in the center of mass frame. In order for this relation to be valid, t must be chosen such that Pi 1. We ran a series of merger simulations with m varying between 0 and 1.25 cm2 g 1. Each simulation run included 106 DM particles gas was not included in the simulations, see discussion in 4.5 . Additionally, we performed a convergence test run with 107 DM particles and m 1 cm2 g 1, which agreed well with the lower resolution run for all tests we performed. We interpret this agreement as indicating that the effects of individual self interacting DM particles are well modeled by the large computation particles used in the simulations, and that the results we present here are not seriously affected by numerical resolution effects. The ratio of DM particles in the main cluster and subcluster was set equal 5 to the initial total mass ratio of the clusters, which is known analytically from the King models used to build the clusters. In this work, we apply a new method for constraining m based on the absence of an offset between the subcluster total mass and galaxy centroids. For this, we added another family of particles to the simulations to represent the collisionless galaxies. We choose 105 normal galaxy particles for the main cluster and 2.5 104 for the subcluster throughout. The ratio of the number of normal galaxy particles was estimated based on galaxy counts given by Barrena et al. . The galaxies were initially distributed like the DM in each run. The mass in galaxies was assumed to be roughly 5 of the total mass for each cluster, which, combined with the number of galaxy particles, gives a low mass per galaxy

These effects are not limited to reproducing the well known contributions of the gauge theory instantons but also generate extra terms in the superpotential or the prepotential. On these brane instantons there are some neutral fermionic zero modes in addition to the ones expected from broken supertranslations. They are crucial in correctly reproducing effects which are dual to gauge theory instantons, but they may make some other interesting contributions vanish. We analyze how orientifold projections can remove these zero modes and thus allow for new superpotential terms. These terms contribute to the dynamics of the effective gauge theory, for instance in the stabilization of runaway directions. Keywords Instantons, D branes. Contents 1. Introduction 1 2.

Introduction It has long been realized that instantons in string theory are often in close correspon dence with instantons in gauge theories . Recently it was found that in some situations stringy instantons can dynamically generate some terms which from a low energy effective point of view enter as ordinary external couplings in the superpo tential of gauge theories living on space filling branes . By instantons in string theory we generally mean instantons which are geometrically real ized as Euclidean extended objects wrapped on some non trivial cycles of the geometry. Thus, in a sense, a stringy instanton has a life of its own , not requiring an underlying gauge theory. This opens up the possibility of having contributions originating from instantons that do not admit a standard gauge theory realization. We shall refer to these instantons as exotic. 1 There has been some debate in the recent literature about the instances where such exotic instantons can actually contribute to the gauge theory superpotential in a non trivial manner. In this work we will contribute to such a debate by considering backgrounds where a simple CFT description is possible, such as orbifolds or orientifolds thereof. We present various simple examples of what we believe to be a rather generic situation. Namely, the presence of extra zero modes for these instantons, in addition to those required by the counting of broken symmetries, makes some of their contributions vanish. Such extra zero modes should not come as a surprise, since a D brane instanton in a CY manifold breaks a total of four out of eight supercharges, i.e. it has two extra fermionic zero modes from the point of view of holomorphic . We give some arguments as to why the backreaction of the instanton should not remove these extra zero modes, and why they should be taken into account in the study of the instanton effects. In particular we will show that the presence of these extra zero modes can be crucial in reproducing the effects of gauge theory instantons. On the other hand, it may be possible that such extra zero modes can give contributions which are not present in the gauge theory instanton picture. If this would be the case one should carefully distinguish between the two classes of contributions, and understand how the gauge theory instanton picture is extended by the stringy instantons. We will analyze these issues by studying the effects of D brane instantons on the holomorphic quantities of a D brane gauge theory at an orbifold singularity. In particular we will analyze how orientifold projections can remove these zero modes and thus allow for new superpotential terms. In the next section we will discuss the general setting and some preliminary results. Then, in section 3, we will consider the Z2 orbifold, and present some results on the new super potencial terms that can be generated by D brane instantons. In section 4 we will turn to the Z2 orientifold, in order to see how

Chunk: and conspires to make everything vanishing as opposite to the ADS case analyzed before . A natural question is to see whether these zero modes get lifted by some effect we have not taken into account, yet. For one thing, supersymmetry arguments would make one think that taking into account the back reaction of the D3 branes might change things. However, in the following subsection we show that this seems not to be the case. 3.4 Study of the back reaction Let us stick to the case , which is the only one where the integral might give a non vanishing contribution. In this case the fractional brane system is nothing but a stack of Nc . These branes couple to only one of the 3 closed string twisted sectors . More specifically, they source the metric h , the R R four form potential C and two twisted scalars b and c from the NS NS and R R sector respectively. This means that the disk one point function of their vertex operators is non vanishing when the disk boundary is attached to such D3 branes. Indeed in this way or, equivalently, by using the boundary state formalism , one can derive the profile for these fields. If the back reaction of these fields on the instanton lifted the extra zero modes s, this should be visible when computing the one point function of the corresponding closed string vertex operators on a disk with insertions on this boundary of the vertex operators for such moduli. To see whether such coupling is there, we first need to write down the vertex operators for the s in the 1 2 superghost pictures. The vertex in the 1 2 picture is found e.g. in and reads V 1 2 z AS z SA z e z 2 , where S z and SA z are the spin fields in the first four and last six directions re spectively. For our argument we need to focus on the SA z dependence. Since the modulus that survives the orbifold projection is, with our conventions, , we write the corresponding spin field as S z eiH1 z 2eiH2 z 2eiH3 z 2, where Hi z is the free boson used to bosonize the fermionic sector in the i th complex direction i z eiHi z . The vertex operator in the 1 2 picture can be obtained by 16 applying the picture changing operator to V 1 2 z QBRST, V 1 2 z . The crucial part in QBRST is i e X i Zi i Zi . . . Because of the nature of the supercurrent, we see that flips at most one sign in , hence the product V 1 2 V 1 2 will always carry an unbalanced charge in some of the three internal SO groups. On the other hand, the vertex operators for the fields sourced by the fractional D3 s cannot compensate such an unbalance. Hence, their correlation function on the D instanton with the insertion of V 1 2 V 1 2 carries a charge unbalance and therefore vanishes. Therefore, at least within the above perturbative approach, the neutral zero modes seem not to get lifted by the back reaction of the D3 branes. One might consider some additional ingredients which could provide the lifting. A natural guess would be moving in the CY moduli space or adding suitable background fluxes . There are indeed non vanishing background fields at the orbifold point, i.e. the b fields of the twisted sectors which the . These fields, however, being not associated to geometric deformations of the internal space should be described by a CFT vertex operator uncharged under the SO s, simply because of Lorentz invariance in the internal space. Therefore, the only way to get an effective mass term for the zero modes would be to move

Chunk: presence of non trivial closed string backgrounds, both of NS NS type and of R R type . 3 The neutral sector, which comprises the zero modes of strings with both ends on the D instantons. It is usually referred to as the neutral sector because these modes do not transform under the gauge group. The zero modes are easily ob tained by dimensionally reducing the maximally supersymmetric gauge theory to zero dimensions. We will use an ADHM inspired notation . We denote the bosonic fields as a and a, where the distinction between the two is made by the presence of the D3 branes. The fermionic zero modes are denoted by M A and A, where and denote the positive and negative four dimensional chi ralities and A is an SU fundamental or anti fundamental index denoting the chirality in the transverse six dimensions. The ten dimensional chirality of both fields is taken to be negative. In Euclidean space M and must be treated as independent. When needed, we will also introduce the triplet of auxiliary fields Dc, directly analogous to the four dimensional D, that can be used to express the various interactions in an easier form as we will see momentarily. All these fields are k k matrices where k is the instanton number. The charged sector, comprising the zero modes of strings stretching between a D3 brane and a D instanton. For each pair of such branes we have two conjugate sectors distinguished by the orientation of the string. In the NS sector, where the world sheet fermions have opposite modding as the bosons, we obtain a bosonic spinor in the first four directions where the GSO projection picks out the neg ative chirality. In the conjugate sector, we will get an independent bosonic spinor of the same chirality. Similarly, in the R sector, after the GSO projection we obtain a pair of independent fermions one for each conjugate sector both in the fundamental of SU which we denote by A and A. These fields are rectangular matrices N k and k N. The couplings of the fields in the gauge sector give rise to a four dimensional gauge theory. The instanton corrections to such a theory are obtained by constructing the Lagrangian describing the interaction of the gauge sector with the charged sector zero modes while performing the integral over all zero modes, both charged and neutral. A crucial point to notice and which will be important later is that while the neutral modes do not transform under the gauge group, their presence affects the integral because of their coupling to the charged sector. The part of the interaction involving only the instanton moduli is well known from the ADHM construction and it is essentially the reduction of the interacting gauge Lagrangian for these modes in a specific limit where the Yukawa terms for and the quadratic term for D are scaled out see for details . The final form of this part 4 of the interaction is a , a 2 a a i 2 a AB A B a i 4 a ABM A a, MB i A A M A, a A iDc c i c a , a o where the sum over colors and instanton indices is understood. denotes the usual Pauli matrices, and the t Hooft symbols and and are used to construct the six dimensional gamma matrices 0 a a 0 . The above interactions can all be understood in terms of string diagrams on a disk with open string vertex operators inserted at the boundary in the 0 limit. The interaction of the charged sector with the scalars of the gauge sector can be worked out in a similar way and yields XaXa i 2 a AB AXa Bo . Let us rewrite the above action in a way which will be more illuminating in the following

The first term on the righthand side represents a drift with the mean velocity u and the second term represents a diffusion arising from the velocity covariance D. Similar diffusions on the path and loop spaces of a manifold M have been much studied, motivated in part by questions from quantum field theory . The above considerations are rigorously justifiable for the case of a Lipschitz velocity with 1 but are only formal when 1. A more careful and also more physically realistic approach in the latter case is to replace the advecting velocity u with a coarse grained or smoothed velocity u u, by convolution with a smooth filter kernel r d r . The length scale can be interpreted as a mathematical representation of the viscous cutoffin a true turbulent velocity field . The exact solution of the Liouville equation for such a smoothed velocity is Pu dC, t C0, t0 C t,t0 C0 dC, with initial condition Pu dC, t0 C0, t0 C C0 dC. Here t,t M M is the stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms generated by the smoothed velocity field u , section 4.6 .

In the weakly compressible regime and, in particular, for a divergence free velocity field satisfying this 4 limit should yield a non degenerate diffusion. 1 This is a generalization of the phenomenon of spontaneous stochasticity to the turbulent advection of lines, with initial line C0 at time t0 splitting into a random ensemble of lines C at time t. As for the case of smooth advection, an unconditional diffusion satisfying equation may be obtained by averaging over the velocity u. The instantaneous realizations C of this diffusion process should be fractal

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0266v2 astro ph 30 Apr 2007 Supernova Polarization and the Type IIn Classification Jennifer L. Hoffman Department of Astronomy, UC Berkeley, 601 Campbell Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 3411 Abstract. While the members of the Type IIn category of supernovae are united by the presence of strong multicomponent Balmer emission lines in their spectra, they are quite heterogeneous with respect to other properties such as Balmer line profiles, light curves, strength of radio emission, and intrinsic brightness. We are now beginning to see variety among SNe IIn in their polarimetric characteristics as well, some but not all of which may be due to inclination angle effects. The increasing number of known hybrid SNe with IIn like emission lines suggests that circumstellar material may be more common around all types of SNe than previously thought. Investigation of the correlations between spectropolarimetric signatures and other IIn attributes will help us address the question of classification of interacting SNe and the possibility of distinguishing different groups within the diverse IIn subclass. Keywords supernovae, type IIn, supernova classification PACS 97.60.Bw Type IIn narrow line supernovae SNe IIn are Type II events whose primary distinction is the existence of strong narrow hydrogen Balmer emission lines in the spectra . These lines indicate the presence of circumstellar material ejected by the progenitor star and excited by the UV and X ray photons from the supernova explosion. The IIn subclass includes 2 5 of all Type II supernovae . Turatto categorized the SNe IIn as a special class of core collapse supernovae related to the SNe Ib c and hypernovae. However, in recent years several new discoveries have blurred the boundaries between the IIn category and other types of supernovae. It should be noted that since the label of IIn is assigned based on spectral characteristics, while that of II L or II P is based on features of the light curve, these three categories are not mutually exclusive, and some objects may be given more than one classification in the literature. But observations of hybrid supernovae such as SN 2002ic and SN 2005gj , which showed IIn like H lines superposed on type Ia like spectra, and of chameleon supernovae such as SN 2001em , which evolved from a Type Ic to a Type IIn over the span of a few years, suggest that not only SNe II but potentially all supernovae may show signatures of interaction with circumstellar material. Consequently, Turatto s revised classification scheme includes a broad category of interacting SNe that spans all SN types and includes the SNe IIn. The IIn category has always been heterogeneous, as noted by Filippenko , whose Figure 14 presented a non coeval collection of SN IIn spectra. Figure 1 shows that even when compared at similar ages, SNe IIn have quite diverse spectral characteristics. The primary feature of SNe IIn spectra, the strong H emission line, also varies substantially in strength and profile between objects of comparable age Figure 2 and even for a given object over time. In particular, the very narrow component of H FIGURE 1 Deredshifted optical spectra of four Type IIn super novae at similar epochs, showing the diversity of spectral character istics within the subtype.

Hydrogen Balmer lines are labeled. does not necessarily exist at all times in the evolution of a SN IIn. In SN 1997eg Figure 3 , this narrow H component disappeared after 100 days post discovery, was replaced by a small symmetric absorption feature, and then reappeared around day 400. The H line in SN 1998S their Figure 7 also lost its narrow emission component early

Chunk: of the binary and the radial velocity amplitude of the donor star were measured and yielded a mass function, f M 3.17 M , which established A0620 00 as a likely BH XRB McClintock Remillard 1986 . Further observations established the binary mass ratio and determined the masses of the stars to within one unknown, the binary orbital inclination 3.09 0.09 sin3 i M and 0.21 0.09 sin3 i M , where M1 and M2 are the BH and donor star masses, respectively Marsh, Robinson Wood 1994 1Visiting Astronomer at the Infrared Telescope Facility, which is operated by the University of Hawaii under Cooperative Agreement no. NCC 5 538 with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Science Mission Directorate, Planetary Astronomy Program. 3 Orosz et al. 1994 . Several groups have determined values for the inclination, with the num bers ranging from 38 i 75 . As a result, estimates of the BH mass in A0620 00 vary from 3.3 to 13.6 M Haswell et al. 1993 Shahbaz, Naylor Charles 1994 Froning Robinson 2001 Gelino et al. 2001 . The broad range of derived inclinations and BH masses for A0620 00 result from long term variability in the system and from uncertain determinations of the amount of veiling, or dilution, by sources other than the donor star. The inclination is determined by modeling the amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations in the donor star light curve, so both of these effects will alter the derived BH mass. In particular, an additional source will dilute the amplitude of the ellipsoidal variation, leading to an underestimate of the inclination and a corresponding overestimate of the BH mass if not taken into account. The best way to determine the true donor star contribution in A0620 00 is to model its spectrum, particularly in the NIR, where the late type donor star is expected to domi nate. Shahbaz, Bandyopadhyay Charles modeled a low S N, K band spectrum of A0620 00, from which they concluded that the accretion disk contributes at most 27 of the continuum in the NIR. They fit only the 12CO bandhead at 2.29 m, however, which is sen sitive to both temperature and luminosity of the donor star and may be prone to metallicity effects in compact binary systems Froning Robinson 2001 . Harrison et al. also recently published a K band spectrum of A0620 00 in which they confirmed that the 12CO absorption lines are anomalously weak. What is needed to settle the debate over the con tribution of the accretion disk to the NIR spectrum of A0620 00 are higher S N, broadband spectra. To this end, we have obtained and present here 0.8 2.4 m spectroscopy of A0620 00 obtained with SpeX at the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility IRTF . This manuscript is organized as follows 2 summarizes the data reduction and calibration steps 3 presents the data analysis and modeling of the donor star spectrum and 4 gives discussion and conclusions. 2.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0268v1 quant ph 2 Apr 2007 Automated Generation of Layout and Control for Quantum Circuits Mark Whitney, Nemanja Isailovic, Yatish Patel and John Kubiatowicz University of California, Berkeley eecs.berkeley.edu To appear in the ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers, 2007 Abstract We present a computer aided design flow for quantum circuits, complete with automatic layout and control logic extraction. To motivate automated layout for quantum circuits, we investigate grid based layouts and show a performance variance of four times as we vary grid structure and initial qubit placement. We then propose two polynomial time design heuristics a greedy algorithm suitable for small, congestion free quantum circuits and a dataflow based analy sis approach to placement and routing with implicit initial placement of qubits. Finally, we show that our dataflow based heuristic generates better layouts than the state of the art automated grid based lay out and scheduling mechanism in terms of latency and potential pipelinability, but at the cost of some area. 1 Introduction Quantum computing offers us the opportunity to solve certain problems thought to be intractable on a classical machine. For example, the follow ing classically hard problems benefit from quan tum algorithms factorization , unsorted database search , and simulation of quantum mechanical sys tems . In addition to significant work on quantum al gorithms and underlying physics, there have been several studies exploring architectural trade offs for quantum computers. Most such research has focused on simulating quantum algorithms on a fixed layout rather than on techniques for quantum circuit synthesis and layout generation. These studies tend Classical Control HDL Format plus annotations for scheduling Quantum Layout including initial qubit placement Basic Blocks Custom Modules Quantum Circuit Specification CAD Flow for Quantum Circuits New Custom Module Figure 1 The goal of our CAD flow is to automate the laying out of a quantum circuit to generate a physical layout, an intelligent initial placement of qubits, the associated classical control logic and an notations to help the online scheduler better use the layout optimizations as they were intended. This flow may then be used recursively to design larger blocks using previously created modules. to use hand generated and hand optimized layouts on which efficient scheduling is then performed. While this approach is quite informative in a new field, it quickly becomes intractable as the size of the circuit grows. Our goal is to automate most of the tasks involved in generating a physical layout and its associated con trol logic from a high level quantum circuit specifica tion Figure 1 . Our computer aided design CAD flow should process a quantum circuit specification and produce the following a physical layout in the desired technology an intelligent initial qubit placement in the lay out classical control circuitry specified in some hard ware description language HDL , which may then be run through a classical CAD flow 1 a set of annotations or hints for the online scheduler, allowing a tighter coupling of layout optimizations to actual runtime operation Much like a classical CAD flow, this quantum CAD flow is intended to be used hierarchically. We begin with a set of technology specific basic blocks some ion trap technology examples are given in Section 2 . We then lay out some simple quantum circuits with the CAD flow, thus creating custom modules. The CAD flow may then be used recursively to create ever larger designs. This approach allows us to develop, evaluate and reuse design heuristics and avoids both the uncertainty and time intensive nature of hand generated layouts. 1.1 Motivation for a Quantum CAD Flow Quantum circuits that are large enough to be inter esting require the orchestration of hundreds of thou sands of physical components. In approaching such problems, it is important to build upon prior work in classical CAD flows. Although the specifics of quan tum technologies such as are discussed in Section 2 are different

Chunk: study, we choose trapped ions as our substrate technology. Trapped ions have shown good potential for scalability . In this technol ogy, a physical qubit is an ion, and a gate is a loca tion where a trapped ion may be operated upon by a modulated laser. The ion is both trapped and ballistically moved by applying pulse sequences to discrete electrodes which line the edges of ion traps. Figure 3a shows an experimentally demonstrated layout for a three way intersection . A qubit may be held in place at any trap region, or it may be ballistically moved between them using the gray electrodes lining the paths. Rather than using ion traps as basic blocks, we de fine a library of macroblocks consisting of multiple traps for two reasons. First, macroblocks abstract out some of the low level details, insulating our anal yses from variations in the technology implementa tions of ion traps. Details such as which ion species is used, specific electrode sizing and geometry clearly variable in the layout in Figure 3a and exact voltage levels necessary for trapping and movement are all encapsulated within the macroblock. Second, ballis tic movement along a channel requires carefully timed application of pulse sequences to electrodes in non adjacent traps. By defining basic blocks consisting of a few ion traps, we gain the benefit that crossing an interface between basic blocks requires communica tion only between the two blocks involved. We use the library of macroblocks shown in Fig ure 2, each of which consists of a 3x3 grid of trap re gions and electrodes, with ports to allow qubit move ment between macroblocks. The black squares are gate locations, which may not be performed at inter sections or turns in ion trap technology. Each of these macroblocks may be rotated in a layout. This library is by no means exhaustive, however it does provide the major pieces necessary to construct many physi cal circuits. The macroblocks we present are abstrac tions of experimentally demonstrated ion trap tech nology . In Figure 3, we show how one can map a demonstrated layout Figure 3a to our macroblock abstractions Figure 3b . We model this layout as a set of StraightChannel and ThreeWayIntersection macroblocks. Above the ion trap plane is an array of MEMS mirrors which routes laser pulses to the gate locations in order to apply quantum gates , as shown in Figure 3c. Some key differences between this quantum circuit technology and classical CMOS are as follows Wires in ion traps consist of rectangular chan nels, lined with electrodes, with atomic ions sus pended above the channel regions and moved ballistically . Ballistic movement of qubits requires synchronized application of voltages on channel electrodes to move data around. Thus each wire requires movement control circuitry to handle any qubit communication. A by product of the synchronous nature of the qubit wire channels is that these circuits can be used in a synchronous manner with no ad ditional overhead. This enables some convenient pipelining options which will be discussed in Sec tion 8.1. 3 Figure 3 a Experimentally demonstrated physical layout of a T junction three way intersection . b Abstraction of the circuit in a , built using the StraightChannel and ThreeWayIntersection macroblocks shown in Figure 2. c The ion traps are laid out on a plane, above which is an array of MEMS mirrors used to route and split the laser beams that apply quantum gates. Each gate location will likely have the ability to perform any operation available in ion trap technology. This enables the reuse gate locations within a quantum circuit. Scalable ion trap systems will almost certainly be two dimensional due to the difficulty of fab ricating and controlling ion traps in a third di mension . This means that all ion crossings must be intersections. Any routing channel may be shared by multi ple

Chunk: ions as long as control circuits prevent multi ion occupancy. Consequently, our circuit model resembles a general network, although schedul ing the movement in a general networking model adds substantial complexity to our circuit. Movement latency of ions is not only dependent on Manhattan distance but also on the geometry of the wire channel. Experimentally, it has been shown that a right angle turn takes substantially longer than a straight channel over the same dis tance . 3 Related Work Prior research has laid the groundwork for our quan tum circuit CAD flow. Svore et al proposed a design flow capable of pushing a quantum program down to physical operations. Their work outlined various file formats and provided initial implementa tions of some of the necessary tools. Similarly, Balen siefer et al proposed a design flow and compi lation techniques to address fault tolerance and pro vided some tools to evaluate simple layouts. While our CAD flow builds upon some of these ideas, we concentrate on automatic layout generation and con trol circuitry extraction. Additionally, initial hand optimized layouts have been proposed in the literature. Metodi et al pro posed a uniform Quantum Logic Array architecture, which was later extended and improved in . Their work concentrated on architectural research and did not delve into details of physical layout or scheduling. Finally, Metodi et al created a tool to automati cally generate a physical operations schedule given a quantum circuit and a fixed grid based layout struc ture. We extend and improve upon their work by adding new scheduling heuristics capable of running on grid based and non grid based layouts. Maslov et al have recently proposed heuristics for the mapping of quantum circuits onto molecules used in liquid state NMR quantum computing tech nology. Their algorithm starts with a molecule to be used for computation, modeled as a weighted graph with edges representing atomic couplings within the molecule. The dataflow graph of the circuit is mapped onto the molecule graph with an effort to minimize overall circuit runtime. Our techniques fo cus on circuit placement and routing in an ion trap technology and do not use a predefined physical sub strate topology as in the NMR case. A new ion trap geometry is instead generated by our toolset for each circuit. 4 Quantum CAD Flow The ultimate goal of a quantum CAD flow is identical to that of a standard classical CAD flow to automate 4 High Level Description Synthesizer Tech Independent Netlist Tech Mapping Tech Specific Gates, Encoding, Fault Tolerance Tech Parameter File Basic Blocks Custom Modules Tech Dependent Netlist Interconnect if necessary Placement and Routing Classical Control Synthesis for Qubit Movement Geometry Aware Netlist Figure 4 An overview of our CAD flow for quantum circuits.

The gray red in the online version solid line denotes one of the initial instantaneous spectrum at the beginning of the simulation whereas the black long dashed line indicates the last spectrum obtained from the simulation. 20 5. Summary An extensive analysis of the data of 3C 66A, obtained from the multiwavelength mon itoring campaign on 3C 66A from July 2003 to April 2004, was carried out using a time dependent leptonic jet model. The analysis was targeted towards understanding the dom inant radiation mechanism in the production of the high energy component of the SED of 3C 66A in the quiescent as well as the flaring state. Our simulations yielded predictions regarding the observable variability patterns in the X ray as well as the VHE energy regimes where such patterns could not be detected during the campaign. The object was well sam pled in the optical, especially in the R band, during the campaign. It had exhibited several major outbursts 10 days in this regime with a varibility of m 0.3 0.5. The X ray data covered the 3 10 keV range with the onset of the high energy component expected at 10 keV photon energies. Only upper limits in the VHE regime had been obtained. The simulations from our model could successfully reproduce the observed SED as well as the optical spectral variability patterns. The model suggests the dominance of the SSC mechanism in the production of hard X ray as well as VHE photons. On the other hand, soft X ray photons exhibit spectral softening during flaring indicating the onset of the synchrotron component in this energy range. According to the simulated time averaged spectrum, the synchrotron component is expected to cut offnear 7 keV whereas the SSC component cuts offat 4 GeV. A flaring profile that was Gaussian in time could successfully reproduce the observed flaring profile for a timescale of 10 days. The simulated varibility in R m 0.55 agreed well with the observed variability. According to the simulations, the object flares up in R and B simultaneoulsy with obs cool,syn 37 minutes being less than or equal to the light crossing time 2 hours during flaring. No significant variability is predicted in the hard X ray regime. This is due to the production of such photons from Compton upscattering offlow energy electrons with cooling timescales much longer than the light crossing time, 3Rb 4c. On the other hand, the simulated lightcurves of VHE ray photons exhibit significant variability as such photons are produced from the Compton upscattering offhigher energy electrons with shorter cooling timescales than the light crossing time. The effect of the optical depth due to absorption by the IIBR on the SED of 3C 66A was also evaluated. The simulations do not predict a significant effect on the SED due to the optical depth. The SSC emission cutoffpredicted to be at 4 GeV can be taken as the intrinsic SSC emission cutoffvalue for this object. We predict the object to be well within the observational range of MAGIC, VERITAS and GLAST. Finally, the EC emission for this object was also calculated and it appears that the EC emission could be dominant in the high energy component initially, but as the emission region travels further 21 away from the BLR, the EC contribution becomes less significant and the SSC emission takes over. It is highly probable that this maximum contribution of the EC component might explain

Chunk: keV is indicated by a black dashed curve and exhibits an amplitude variation of 1.4 1012 Jy Hz. The 3, 10 and 15 keV lightcurves, denoted by the black solid line, black long dashed line and the black dot dashed curve, respectively, on the other hand do not exhibit much variability. In the VHE regime, the 1 MeV lightcurve is denoted by a black solid line. The 100 MeV lightcurve is indicated by a black long dashed curve and the simulated variability amplitude in this energy regime is on the order of 1012 Jy Hz. The black dot dashed line indicates the lightcurve at 10 GeV. 14 13.60 13.70 13.80 13.90 14.00 14.10 R magnitude 0.640 0.660 0.680 0.700 0.720 0.740 0.760 0.780 B R Fig. 6. The simulated hardness intensity diagram indicates a positive correlation between R and B band for an outburst lasting for 10 days. The object becomes brighter in R and harder in B R as shown by the arrows. The spectral upturn takes place at B R 0.72 mag where the flux in B equals that in R corresponding to . 15 indicate that the particles synchrotron cooling timescale is less than or equal to the light crossing time. obs cool,sy 2.8 103 15 1 2 B 2.9 G 3 2 1 2 15 s We can calculate the observed synchrotron cooling timescale, obs cool,syn in the optical regime from equation 6 B ottcher et al. 2005 using 24, .4 G and .48 for the quiescent state and .8 G and .1 for the flaring state see Figures 1 and 2 , where 15 is the characteristic synchrotron frequency in units of 1015 Hz. This yields a value of obs cool,sy 1.2 hours for the quiescent state whereas for the flaring state it reduces to 37 minutes. The observed minimum variability timescale of 2 hours might therefore correspond to the observed dynamical timescale, where obs dyn Rb c 1 z D . This implies that it takes time to build up the electron population in the emission region through flaring but once built up the electrons lose their energy efficiently to produce synchrotron photons. This can be used to constrain the value of the magnetic field in the jet, which has been allowed to evolve in time keeping .4 Gauss in the simulated quiescent state and 2.8 Gauss in the simulated flaring period. The crossover of X ray lightcurves, in our simulations, is a result of the dominance of the SSC component in hard X rays see Figure 5 . The lightcurve of soft X ray photons of energy 1 keV exhibits a greater variability of 1.4 1012 Jy Hz in its flux as compared to their optical counterpart. This is expected because the soft X ray photons, during the flaring episode, are produced from synchrotron emission of electrons that are accelerated to very high energies and as a result have a very short cooling timescale and thus greater variability. In case of hard X rays no significant variability is predicted. This is because such photons are produced from Compton upscattering of synchrotron photons offthe low energy electrons and as a result the cooling timescale is much longer as compared to the cooling timescale of their soft X ray and optical counterparts. Hence, the variability information gets washed out. The predicted X ray spectral variability pattern of large variability in the low X ray energy band and negligible variability in the high X ray energy band is similar to what has also been observed in BL Lacertae on several occasions see for e.g., Ravasio et al. 2003, 2002 . As can be seen in Figure 7, spectral hysteresis patterns are not predicted for optical as 16 well as soft X ray photons. The lightcurves of the different energy bands are shown in Figure 8.

Chunk: in a broad sense, as a speciation event. Now, if the model space represents the mentioned strat egy space and the diffusion models the mutation process during reproduction, we can identify the mechanism of growth control with natural selection and the branching events with the speciation process. This different inter pretation justifies the analogy between a model that de scribes the speciation process and the ones that describe spatial pattern formation in the evolution of bacterial colonies, vegetation or predation. We must remember that, since this model does not in clude sexual reproduction, we are describing trait diver gence in an asexual population, rather than speciation. Anyway, apart from effects strictly related to sexual re production, the dynamics characterized by the individu 1 als diffusion from regions of low viability in favor of more viable ones, is the essential core of these two phenomena. A detailed and motivated discussion of these processes can be found in the following

Chunk: at intermediate densities 103. 105 for H2CO .8 for CO . In this scheme, the offset between the CO 1 0 peak and the H2CO maximum absorption may seem puzzling. Note that a similar trend is seen at higher resolution while the CO peak in the full resolution CO map published by Heyer et al. and Helfer Blitz is at .8, .3, the H2CO absorption feature seen in the high resolution VLA images published by Evans et al. is centered around .9, .3, again a few arcminutes to the east. We suggest that a combination of two effects may explain this puzzling result. First, it can be seen from the excitation analysis presented in Appendix A that the H2CO absorption strength saturates for T 30 K, whereas the temperature of the CO emission continues to rise at higher kinetic temperature Fig. 5 . For example, while the H2CO line strength increases by only about 30 when the kinetic temperature goes from 20 to 40 K, the CO 1 0 line intensity increases by more than a factor of two. According to Park Minh , the CO brightness temperature is about 40 K at the peak and 20 K for the rest of the cloud. Thus, the strong CO peak behind S140 may well be largely due to enhanced kinetic temperatures related to local heating by the external star providing the ionization of S140, and or by the infrared sources embedded in the cloud . As one progresses into the cloud, the local heating diminishes, and the CO line intensity fades. Also, it should be pointed out that the formaldehyde calculations presented in the Appendix show that the 6 cm line should be seen in emission rather than absorption when the density exceeds 105 cm 3. The fact that this is not the case near the CO peak neither in our low resolution data, nor in the high resolution VLA data presented by Evans 1978 suggests that the gas density there is lower than 105 cm 3. Other effects that could explain the offset between the CO and the H2CO peaks are the lower dissociation energy, and the lower abundance and, therefore, lower self shielding of formaldehyde compared to CO see Appendix A.3 . In a photo dissociated region, these effects should combine to create a stratified distribution where CO survives nearer the source of the UV photons than H2CO. This stratification, combined with the heating of the CO, 11 would naturally lead to the offset between H2CO and CO seen in the present data. Finally, the origin of the other main difference between CO and H2CO in S140, namely the existence of CO emission at the south of L1204 with no or little formaldehyde counterpart, is likely related to another aspect of the excitation differences between the 6 cm line of formaldehyde and the 1 0 transition of carbon monoxide. Fig. 6 of the Appendix A.2 shows that the density detection limit for H2CO line is 10 times larger than the density limit for the CO 1 0 line. We therefore suggest that the gas traced by the CO emission to the south of L1204 is of relatively very low density. It is interesting to note, indeed, that classical high density molecular tracers e.g. CS or NH3 have only been detected around the CO peak behind S140, and not in the southern region of the cloud. Thus, we conclude that the CO 1 0 and H2CO 6 cm lines both tend to preferentially trace warm gas at intermediate densities. There are, however, significant differences related either to differing excitation requirements or to differing abundances. These differences can easily explain the large scatter in the CO H2CO relation. 6. Conclusions The main conclusions of this work are the following 1. We have mapped a large region 70 110 around L1204 S140 in the 6 cm line of formaldehyde, observing a total

Chunk: of 72 regularly spaced positions every 10 on a regular grid. The center of our map was at . 0, . 3, and formaldehyde was detected against the cosmic microwave background in at least 16 of our 72 positions Fig. 2 . 2. The formaldehyde emission can be separated in three spatio kinematical components Fig. 3 two at VLSR 11 km s 1 in the northeast part of the cloud, and at VLSR 8 km s 1 just behind S140 are clearly associated with L1204, whereas the other an isolated component at VLSR 2.5 km s 1 towards the southeast is most likely a local foreground cloud unrelated to S140 L1204. 3. Both qualitatively and quantitatively, the CO 1 0 emission and the formaldehyde 6 cm absorption lines correlate fairly well. An excitation analysis shows that both preferentially trace warm gas at intermediate densities. 4. There are, however, notable differences between the CO and H2CO lines, that can be traced to differing excitation requirements and abundances. Those differences are most likely the origin of the large scatter in the CO H2CO intensity correlation. 12 We thank Professor Roy Booth, director retired of the radio observatory at Onsala, for generous allocations of telescope time and for his warm hospitality during our several visits to the observatory.

The plates were processed into the present compressed digital form with the permission of these institutions. A. Model calculations A.1. Collisional pumping Observations of H2CO in dark clouds show that the anomalous absorption of the 6 and 2 cm lines is due to collisions with H2 that selectively overpopulate the lower levels of the lines Evans et al. 1975 . We calculated the non LTE equilibrium populations of the first 40 levels of ortho H2CO assuming excitation by the 2.7 K background and collisions with H2. Green has calculated excitation rates of these levels for collisions with He taking advantage of the spherical symmetry of the He potential for kinetic temperatures . According to Green , excitation rates by H2 collisions could be 2.2 times higher than those by He because of the smaller reduced mass and differences in the interaction potentials. We will show the results of the calculations under the assumption that the H2 H2CO collisional rates are the same as the He H2CO rates. Probabilities for the radiative transitions were taken from Jaruschewski et al. . The optical depths of the transitions involved in the pumping mechanism are generally larger than 1 at high densities and a radiative transfer calculation is required. Two limiting approximations in the radiation transport are often considered in molecular clouds the large velocity gradient LVG model and the microturbulent model Leung Liszt 1976 . The LVG model assumes that the line profile is dominated by systematic motion of the gas while the microturbulent model assumes that the turbulent velocity is much larger than any systematic motion. S 140 is likely to have several velocity components, but the existence of large systematic motions in molecular clouds and the validity of the LVG model has not 13 been well established in other molecular clouds e.g. Evans et al. , Zuckerman Evans ,

The Helly number h F of F is the minimal positive integer h such that if a finite subfamily K F satisfies T K for all K K of cardinality h, then T K . Helly s classical theorem 1913, see e.g. asserts that the Helly number of the family of convex sets in Rd is d 1. Helly s theorem and its numerous extensions are of central importance in discrete and computational geometry see . It is of considerable interest to understand the role of convexity in these results, and to find suitable topological extensions. Indeed, it is often the case that topological methods provide a deeper understanding of the underlying combinatorics behind Helly type theorems. Helly himself realized in 1930 see that in his theorem, convex sets can be replaced by topological cells if you impose the additional requirement that all non empty intersections of these cells are again topological cells. Helly s topological version of his theorem also follows from the later nerve theorems of Borsuk, Leray and others see below . The following result was conjectured by Gr unbaum and Motzkin , and proved by Amenta . A family of sets G is an F, r family if for any finite G G, the intersection T G is a union of at most r disjoint sets from F. Theorem 1.1 Amenta . Let F be the family of compact convex sets in Rd. Then for any F, r family G h G r d 1 . The main motivation for the present paper was to find a topological ex tension of Amenta s Theorem. Let X be a simplicial complex on the vertex set V . The induced sub complex on a subset of vertices S V is X S . The link of a subset A V is lk X, A . The geometric realization of X is denoted by X . We identify X and X when no confusion can arise.

Chunk: d. The Leray number can be regarded as a simple topologically based complexity measure of X. Note that L X 0 iffX is a simplex, and L X 1 iffX is the clique complex 2 of a chordal graph see . It is well known see e.g. that L X d iff Hi lk X, 0 for all X and i d. Leray numbers have also significance in commutative algebra, since L X is equal to the Castelnuovo Mumford regularity of the Stanley Reisner ring of X over Q see . From now on we assume that V1, . . ., Vm are finite disjoint 0 dimensional complexes, and denote their join by V1 Vm. Let m 1 be the simplex on the vertex set m , and let denote the simplicial projection from V1 Vm onto m 1 given by v i if v Vi. For a subcomplex X V1 Vm, let r X, max .

A finite family F of compact sets in some topological space is a good cover if for any F F, the intersection T F is either empty or contractible.

Chunk: universal enveloping algebra of su is the associative algebra generated by and 3 subject to the above identities, with the Lie bracket being interpreted as A, B AB BA. The q deformed algebra suq is constructed by replacing 3 with another gen erator. Formally, it is thought of as q 1 2 3, where q C with the exceptions q 0, 1, 1. The Lie bracket relations are replaced by the identities , 4 2 2 q q 1 , q , q . We can rewrite and think of as a small complex number. Then, formally at leading order in , the substitution q 1 2 3 O 2 reduces the deformed identities to the standard Lie algebra relations . The associative algebra generated by and 3 subject to the deformed identities is the algebra suq . For generic q, that is, when q is not a root of unity, the finite dimensional irreducible representations of suq are classified by a half integer, , 1 2, 1, 3 2, . . ., referred to as the spin, in direct analogy with the representations of su and the theory of angular momentum. The dimension of the representation j is 2j 1. When i r is a 2rth root of unity ROU , where , the representations j are still defined, but become reducible for r 2 2. They decompose into a sum of representations with spin at most r 2 2 and so called trace 0 ones, whose nature will be explained below. 2 For the purposes of this paper we are concerned only with intertwiners between representations of suq , i.e., linear maps commuting with the action of the algebra, and their quantum traces1. Any such intertwiner can be constructed from a small set of generators and elemen tary operations on them. These constructions, as well as traces, can be represented graphically. Such graphs are called abstract spin networks. Their calculus is well developed and is described in , whose conventions we follow throughout the paper with one exception we use spins half integers instead of twice spins integers . A brief review of our notation and conventions can be found in the Appendix. Trace 0 representations of suq are so called because the trace of an intertwiner from such a representation to itself is always zero. Thus, they can be freely discarded, as they do not contribute to the evaluation of q deformed spin networks. 2.2 Applications of q deformation Deformation, especially with i r a 2rth primitive ROU, is important for spin foam models for at least two reasons. Replacing . Also, suq spin networks2 naturally appear when considering a positive cosmological constant in loop quantum gravity. The original Ponzano Regge model attempts to express the path integral for 3 dimensional Riemannian general relativity as a sum over labelled triangulations of a 3 manifold. The edges of the triangulation are labelled by discrete lengths, identified with spin labels of irreducible SU representations. Each tetrahedron contributes a 6j symbol factor to the summand, normalized to ensure invariance of the overall sum under change of triangulation. Unfortunately, the Ponzano Regge model turned out to be divergent. Motivated by the construction of 3 manifold invariants, Turaev and Viro were able to regularize the Ponzano Regge model by replacing the SU 6j symbols with their q deformed analogs at a ROU q. The key feature of the regu larization is the truncation of the summation to only the irreducible representations of suq of non zero trace, which leaves only a finite number of terms in the model s partition function. A version of the Barrett Crane model, derived from a group field theory by De Pietri, Freidel, Krasnov and Rovelli DFKR for short , was also found to be divergent. A q deformed version of the same model at a ROU q is similarly regularized see Sec tion 3.2 . Some

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0279v1 astro ph 2 Apr 2007 H I velocity dispersion in NGC 1058 A. O. Petric Astronomy Department, Columbia University, New York, NY USA andreea astro.columbia.edu M. P. Rupen National Radio Astronomy Observatory, P.O. Box O, Socorro, NM, 87801, USA mrupen aoc.nrao.edu ABSTRACT We present excellent resolution and high sensitivity Very Large Array VLA observations of the 21cm H I line emission from the face on galaxy NGC 1058, providing the first reliable study of the H I profile shapes throughout the entire disk of an external galaxy. Our observations show an intriguing picture of the interstellar medium throughout this galaxy velocity dispersions range between 4 to 15 km s 1 but are not correlated with star formation, stars or the gaseous spiral arms. The velocity dispersions decrease with radius, but this global trend has a large scatter as there are several isolated, resolved regions of high dispersion. The decline of star light with radius is much steeper than that of the velocity dispersions or that of the energy in the gas motions. Subject headings galaxies kinematics and dynamics individual NGC 1058 galaxies ISM 1. Introduction Observations of H I velocities perpendicular to the disk vz are necessary for studies of both the interstellar medium ISM McKee Ostriker 1977, Kulkarni Heiles 1988, Braun 1992, 1997 and disk dynamics Oort 1932 Rupen 1987 Lockman Gehman 1991 Merriefield 1993 Malhotra 1994, 1995 Olling 1995 because they set a direct upper limit on the thermal and kinetic temperature of the gas. Hence the H I velocities perpendicular to the disk are an important dynamical tracer and as such can be used to constrain, both the gas mass distribution in the plane and its vertical structure i.e., density as a function of height z above the plane van der Kruit Shostak 1982,1984, Lockman Gehman 1991, Malhotra 1995 . 2 The behavior of the velocity dispersions as a function of galactic radius is important for determinations of the shape of dark matter halos. To date even the most sophisticated methods e.g. Olling 1995, 1996 assume either a constant or an azimuthally symmetric velocity dispersion. Our measurements can therefore be used with studies of edge on systems to determine radial variations in the mass to light M L ratio. Processes associated with star formation,such as stellar winds and multiple supernova explosions are thought to put energy into the ISM in the form of mechanical energy, starlight which leads to photoelectric emission from dust grains , and cosmic rays. The velocity dispersion in the z direction is intimately connected to the forces holding the gas against gravitational instabilities and hence to star formation in the disk e.g. Mac Low Klessen 2004, Li, Mac Low Klessen 2005 . Measuring the degree of correlation between the locations of star forming regions and those of high dispersion is a good method to investigate the relation between star related energy sources and H I bulk motions. The face on spiral galaxy NGC 1058 e.g. Eskridge et al. 2002 is ideal for studies of H I vz dispersions. Its low inclination 4 11 Lewis 1987, van der Kruit Shostak 1984 means that the gradient in rotational velocity is small across the beam and therefore it does not significantly corrupt measurements of velocities perpendicular to the disk. Single dish studies of NGC 1058 Allen Shostak 1979, Lewis 1975, Lewis 1984 lack the resolution to trace the dispersion across the disk but through modeling of the rotational component these authors estimate it to range between 7 and 9 km sec. In a series of papers 1982 1984 van der Kruit Shostak analyze H I emission profiles in a number of face on spiral galaxies and find that the velocity dispersion increases with radius in the inner galaxy and decreases in the outer parts. 3. Observations 3.1 The Very Large Array (VLA) Observations NGC 1058 was observed with the Very Large Array (VLA) in its D configuration. This configuration offers high angular resolution of 0.5 arcsec and a field of view of 2.5 arcminutes. We used 27 antennas, with baselines ranging between 15 to 63 m, in the A, B, C, and D arrays. The data were recorded in 1024 channel mode with 2 MHz channel widths, providing a velocity resolution of approximately 13 km s. 1. The VLA was pointed at the phase center RA = 02:28:55.0, Dec = -06:07:26.0, which is 3 arcsec west and 2 arcsec south of the dynamical center of the galaxy. The primary beam FWHM of the VLA at this frequency is 3.6 arcminutes.

Chunk: but that in the extended gas disk, beyond the Holmberg radius the velocity dispersion is 5.7 km sec everywhere, that is no variations with spiral phase or H I surface density are found. All previous determinations of the H I velocity dispersion in NGC 1058 have been hindered by low spatial e.g., Lewis 1984 and or spectral e.g., van der Kruit Shostak 1984 resolution as well as by relatively poor sensitivity, requiring smoothing over large sections of the galactic disk, or missing up to 40 of the total flux Dickey, Hanson, Helou 1990 . These trade offs have led to significantly different conclusions about the H I velocity dispersion. Our sensitive observations at high spatial and velocity resolution as well as recovery of the entire single dish flux, allowed us to accurately measure the profile widths even in the outskirts of the H I disk, to resolve the arm from the interarm regions, and to analyze in detail the H I profile shapes, not just their breadths throughout the H I disk. 3 2. Observations and Data Reductions The 21cm line of neutral hydrogen in NGC 1058 was observed with the VLA in the C and CS1configurations. The C configuration data was taken on 14 and 15 June 1993 for a total time on source of 12.23 hours. The D configuration observation were performed on 7 and 8 November 1993 for a total time on source of 2.67 hours, and CS configuration data was collected on January 3, 1995 for a total time on source of 5.42 hours. Rupen 1997,1998 gives a detailed account of the UV coverage in each of the configurations, compares the merits of each configuration, and discusses the benefits of combining them. Both the C and CS configurations have a maximum baseline of 3.6 km, while the D configuration has a maximum baseline 1 km . The minimum baseline, which determines the size of the most extended feature which can be observed by the VLA, is 35 m. All observations were taken in dual polarization mode and Hanning smoothing was applied on line resulting in 127 independent spectral channels with a velocity width of 2.58 km sec. We followed the normal AIPS calibration procedures and used the same flux 3C48 and phase 0234 285 calibrators throughout. The continuum emission was approximated as a linear fit to visibilities in 20 line free channels on each side of the signal, and this fit was then subtracted from the uv data in all the channels. Rupen , gives a detailed description of the bandpass calibration and continuum subtraction. The data cube presented here was deconvolved using the CLEAN algorithm as imple mented by AIPS task IMAGR.2, iterated until the residuals were nearly zero and the flux density in the CLEAN model was stable. The cube was tapered to a resolution of 30 29 , or 1.3 1.3 kpc at a distance of 10 Mpc Ferguson et al. 1998 . Rupen , presents a detailed comparison of several cleaning algorithms and motivates the use of the CLEAN algorithm for this data. A more general discussion of CLEAN as implemented in AIPS is given in chapter 5, of the AIPS cookbook as well as in Cornwell, Braun, Briggs 1999. A more specific examination of deconvolution algorithms as applied on our NGC 1058 data is presented in Rupen 1997,1999 . The RMS noise level in the line channels of the cube was 0.5 and mJy beam, corre sponding to a column density of 1.6 1018 cm 2 per channel.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0280v1 astro ph 2 Apr 2007 Common Envelope Evolution Redux Ronald F. Webbink Department of Astronomy, University of Illinois, 1002 W. Green St., Urbana, IL 61801, USA Summary. Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the donor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative en velope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be responsible for the creation of short period binaries with degenerate components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short period binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common envelope episode. The survival of long period inter acting binaries with massive white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget explicitly including recombination resolves this issue. 1 Introduction From the realization 26, 27, et seq. that all cataclysmic variables CVs are interacting binary stars, their existence posed a dilemma for theories of binary evolution. The notion that close binary stars might evolve in ways fundamentally different from isolated stars was rooted in the famous Algol paradox that the cooler, lobe filling subgiant or giant components among these well known eclipsing binaries are less massive, but more highly evolved, than their hotter main sequence companions . The resolution of that para dox invoked large scale mass transfer reversing the initial mass ratios of these binaries . Indeed, model calculations assuming conservation of total mass and orbital angular momenum are qualitatively consistent with the main fea tures of Algol type binaries. Even if quantitative consistency between models 2 Ronald F. Webbink and observational data generally requires some losses of mass and angular momentum among Algol binaries e.g., , the degree of those losses is typically modest, and the remnant binary is expected to adhere closely to an equilibrium core mass radius relation for low mass giant stars see, e.g., the pioneering study of AS Eri by Refsdal, Roth Weigert . Those rem nant binaries are typically of long orbital period days to weeks in compari son with CVs, and furthermore typically contain helium white dwarfs of low mass, especially in the short period limit. In contrast, CVs evidently contain relatively massive white dwarfs, in binary systems of much shorter orbital periods hours , that is, with much smaller total energies and orbital angular momenta. In an influential analysis of the Hyades eclipsing red dwarf white dwarf binary BD 16 516 V471 Tau , Vauclair derived a total system mass less than the turnoffmass of the Hyades, and noted that the cooling age of the white dwarf component was much smaller than the age of the cluster. He speculated that V471 Tau in its present state was the recent product of the ejection of a planetary nebula by the white dwarf. Paczynski realized that, immediately prior to that event, the white dwarf progenitor must have been an asymptotic giant branch star of radius 600 R , far exceeding its current binary separation 3 R . He proposed that the dissipation of orbital energy provided the means both for planetary nebula ejection and for the severe orbital contraction between initial and final states, a process he labeled common envelope evolution not to be confused with the

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0283v1 math.QA 2 Apr 2007 ON THE MARKOV TRACE FOR TEMPERLEY LIEB ALGEBRAS OF TYPE En R.M. Green Department of Mathematics University of Colorado Campus Box 395 Boulder, CO 80309 0395 USA E mail rmg euclid.colorado.edu Abstract. We show that there is a unique Markov trace on the tower of Temperley Lieb type quotients of Hecke algebras of Coxeter type En for all n 6 . We explain in detail how this trace may be computed easily using tom Dieck s calculus of diagrams. As applications, we show how to use the trace to show that the diagram representation is faithful, and to compute leading coefficients of certain Kazhdan Lusztig polynomials. 1. Introduction In the paper , Jones introduced a certain Markov trace on the tower of Hecke algebras H An 1 associated to the Coxeter groups An 1 , which are the symmetric groups. When Jones trace is restricted to one of the algebras An 1 , it is degenerate, but its radical is an ideal, J, of H and so we obtain a generically nondegenerate trace on the algebra H J, which is the Temperley Lieb algebra TLn occurring in statistical mechanics the trace is the matrix trace of a transfer matrix algebra . In , Kazhdan and Lusztig introduced a remarkable polynomial Px,w q for any elements x, w in a Coxeter group W. These polynomials have important ap plications in representation theory. Although the polynomials have an elementary 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 20C08, 20F55, 57M15. Typeset by AMS TEX 1 2 R.M. GREEN definition, the only obvious way to compute them is using a rather complicated recurrence relation. One of the main obstructions to computing the polynomials efficiently is a fast way to compute the integer x, w , which is the coefficient of q l w l x 1 2 in Px,w q . In , the author showed how Jones trace can be used to compute the leading coefficients x, w Z in the case where x and w are fully commutative elements of W in the sense of . In this paper, we will investigate the analogous phenomenon in Coxeter type En. This includes Coxeter groups of types A and D as special cases. The algebras TLn may be defined in terms of generators and relations in a way that generalizes readily to Coxeter systems of other types. These generalized Temperley Lieb algebras have been studied for Coxeter type En by a number of people . Although the Coxeter groups of type En are infinite for , the Hecke algebra quotient TL En in this case is still finite dimensional. In , tom Dieck constructed a diagrammatic representation of TL En , although the question of whether this is a realisation a faithful representation is not tackled. In 9, we will prove Theorem 1.1. The diagrammatic representation of TL En given in is injec tive. The closing remarks of state without proof that this representation can be used to define a Markov trace on the tower of algebras TL En . In Theorem 8.11, we will prove this claim and furthermore we will show that there is a unique such Markov trace. Although this is similar to what happens in type A, the analogous claim for Coxeter type D is false. This trace is also remarkable for other reasons after suitable rescaling, it is a tabular trace in the sense of , and a generalized Jones trace in the sense of . The fact that the trace is tabular implies that it is generically nondegenerate on the algebras TL En . The fact that we have a generalized Jones trace will lead to the following theorem proved in 9 where the monomial basis elements bw are ON THE MARKOV TRACE FOR TEMPERLEY LIEB ALGEBRAS OF TYPE En 3 defined in 3.

The second assertion follows from the fact that deg .4 ii , Proposition 6.2 iii and Proposition 6.3. We will now show that for any nonzero a TLK En , we have tr aa 0, from which the assertion follows. We have wbw, 18 R.M. GREEN and by clearing denominators thus multiplying a by a nonzero scalar , we may assume that we have w A for all w Wc. Choose w with w 0 and N w deg w maximal, and let cw be the integer coefficient of vN w in w . Setting aw v N w w bw , we then have tr aw a w c2 mod v 1Q v 1 . If w 0 but deg w is not maximal, we may again define aw v N w w bw , but then tr aw a w v 1Q v 1 . Since the integers c2 are strictly positive, it follows that tr v N w a v N w a v 1Q v 1 , which completes the proof. Proposition 6.6. Let K be the field of fractions of the power series ring Z v 1 , and let K be the subfield of K consisting of the field of fractions of Z v 2 . i The field TLK En has a unique structure as a Z2 graded algebra over K in which vn has degree n mod 2 and K is precisely the set of elements of degree 0 mod 2. ii The algebra TLK En has a unique structure as a Z2 graded algebra over K in which vn has degree n mod 2 and the generators bs have degree 1 mod 2. We denote the even subalgebra consisting of elements of degree 0 mod 2 by TLK En . iii Let TLK En K be any trace. Then there are unique K linear maps , TLK En K such that v is the restriction of to TLK En , and furthermore, and are themselves traces. Proof. Recall from the proof of Proposition 6.5 that v 1 Q v v 1 , so that each element x K has a unique expression of the form X , ON THE MARKOV TRACE FOR TEMPERLEY LIEB ALGEBRAS OF TYPE En 19 where qi Q and N Z depends on x. Similar reasoning shows that the subfield K of K then consists precisely of those elements for which . Part i is a consequence of this construction. The assertion of ii is immediate from the observation that the defining relations of Proposition 3.1 respect the given grading. Let K K be the map X ! X ivi, where q qi if i is even, 0 otherwise. Our description of K shows that is a K linear map. Denoting the restriction of to TLK En by , it follows that is a trace on TLK En . Since , the maps , v and are also traces, completing the proof of iii . Note that any trace from TLK En to K extends uniquely to a trace from TLK En to K by tensoring by K K . Lemma 6.7. The trace tr TLK En K arises from a trace tr TLK En K by extension of scalars. Proof. We use the notation of 5. Note that if A P, then i A is an element of TLK En of degree A mod 2. We also have tr i A A, which is an element of K of degree A mod 2. Recall that TLK En is a K subalgebra of TLK En and note that if y, z are homogeneous elements of TLK En , then yz and zy have the same degree.

Chunk: is not possible to convert the oscillations of Fig. 9 to those of Fig. 7 by adding the conductivity of many graphene layers to the former. Note that the relative SdH oscillation ampli tudes in Fig. 7 are 16 times smaller than in Fig. 8, while they are more than 20 times smaller in Fig. 6, while the square resistances of all three are within a factor of 3 from each other. The fact that the most intense SdH peaks in 2D samples are seen in the most defective samples, leads us to conclude that defects, specifically in the bulk of the sample i.e. away from the edges are required for large amplitude SdH peaks, and hence for the QHE. This point of view is strengthened by the fact that a coulomb electrostatic potential cannot trap Dirac particles . Hence, if scattering away from the edges is primarily from long range coulomb potentials due to counter ions in the SiC substrate, then these potentials cannot trap the carriers. It is well known that localized states in the bulk are required for the QHE so that the absence of such states would inhibit the QHE ! It would be of course very important that this conclusion is verified since it so dramatically departs from observations in deposited exfoliated graphene samples, which further underscores fundamental differences in these materials. 16

Chunk: back scattering at the ribbon edges should become relatively more important with decreasing width. The amplitudes of the SdH oscillations are much more pronounced for narrow ribbons than for high mobility 2D Hall bars. A relatively large fraction of the high mobility narrower Hall bar samples do not exhibit SdH oscillations at all, as seen in Fig. 10. Occasionally rather complex magnetoresistance structures that in many cases appear not to be random but exhibit features that are approximately linear in field like in the Aharonov Bohm effect . Several of these systems are found to be coherent and ballistic. In one case the resistance of a 0.5 5 m Hall bar abruptly and reversibly drops by an order of magnitude at sq. It appears that scattering at the edges is specular without any back scattering. 14 0 2 4 6 8 1000 1020 1040 1060 1080 B T R G0 Fig. 10. Magnetoresistance of a 0.2 m 1 m ribbon.

The width dependence of mobility. The effects point to a correlated electronic system Levy, Berger, de Heer et al., to be published . 7 Structure dependent properties and the absence of the quantum Hall effect A key focus of epitaxial graphene research is to develop a new graphene based electronics material with shape tunable properties. The intrinsic width dependent bandgap of graphene ribbons has been born out experimentally in back gated deposited exfoliated graphene ribbons . We have not yet demonstrated the effect in epitaxial graphene, primarily due to problems in gating the material, which we hope to solve soon. Currently we have reasonable statistics that appear to suggest that the mobil ities of the ribbons actually increase with decreasing ribbon width Fig. 11 . This intriguing property could be due to the fact that the system becomes more one dimensional with decreasing width and thereby that backscattering is inhibited. On the other hand, the decreasing width also implies that the edges which are presumed to be rough become more important and enhance 15 the scattering. Apparently that effect is not dominant. It is remarkable that the SdH oscillations are extremely weak except for very low mobility samples, that are known to be quite defective as in Fig. 6 . In fact the SdH oscillations are almost imperceptible in the 2D sample the amplitudes are only 0.001 of the mean resistance even though they are well resolved up to the 15th Landau level. The weak localization peak is weak 0.07G0 and evidence is seen for weak anti localization. In contrast, the oscillation of the 2nd Landau level in the low mobility sample 2D is large 0.3 of the mean resistance this sample may exhibit the quantum Hall effect at high fields. Furthermore, the weak localization peak is intense 1G0 In the intermediate regime, the 1 m width ribbon exhibits well resolved SdH peaks 0.016 of the mean resistance while the weak localization peak is 0.52G0, weak anti localization is also present. Narrow ribbons exhibit more intense weak localization peaks, well resolved SdH oscillations, quantum confinement peaks, and high mobilities but no ev idence for the quantum Hall effect. It is believed that the quantum Hall effect may be observed in wider ribbons if the mobility can be increased. The quantum Hall effect has not yet been demonstrated in any graphene based material, although it has been observed in some carbon nanotubes. 2D 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 Width m Fig. 12.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0286v2 math.AP 21 Oct 2007 Mathematics of thermoacoustic tomography Peter Kuchment and Leonid Kunyansky June 12, 2013 Abstract The paper presents a survey of mathematical problems, techniques, and challenges arising in the Thermoacoustic also called Photoacous tic or Optoacoustic Tomography. 1 Introduction Computerized tomography has had a huge impact on medical diagnostics. Numerous methods of tomographic medical imaging have been developed and are being developed e.g., the standard X ray, single photon emission, positron emission, ultrasound, magnetic resonance, electrical impedance, op tical . The designers of these modalities strive to in crease the image resolution and contrast, and at the same time to reduce the costs and negative health effects of these techniques. However, these goals are usually rather contradictory. For instance, some cheap and safe methods with good contrast like optical or electrical impedance tomogra phy suffer from low resolution, while some high resolution methods such as ultrasound imaging often do not provide good contrast. Recently re searchers have been developing novel hybrid methods that combine different physical types of signals, in hope to alleviate the deficiencies of each of the types, while taking advantage of their strengths. The most successful exam ple of such a combination is the Thermoacoustic Tomography TAT Mathematics Department, Texas A M University, College Station, TX 77843 3368, USA. kuchment math.tamu.edu Mathematics Department, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 77843 3368, USA. leonk math.arizona.edu 1 1 .

Chunk: large is not equivalent within a factor of scaling to a system with . We are unable to provide a robust limit for the canonical model of N . Fig. 3 shows the progression of the E N and pressure curves as ,000. 9 V. BIMODALITY THE BASIC FORMULAE IN GRAND CANONICAL AND CANONICAL ENSEMBLE In event by event analysis in experiments, one can in principle ascertain the largest mass or the largest charge emerging in each event from multifragmentation. The probability distribution of this largest mass can be plotted as a function of the value of mass of this largest fragment. It is shown that a bimodality in this distribution at a certain temperature is a signature of a first order phase transition that is, if the system were infinitely large it would have a first order phase transition . Thus from a finite system one can have a signal for phase transition. We will now see how the probability distribution of the largest fragment as a function of the mass of the largest fragment can be computed in the thermodynamic model in the two ensembles. First the grand canonical ensemble. The grand canonical ensemble works best for a large system and we have already seen in the previous section that application of this model to multifragmentation of finite nuclei can lead to serious errors in some temperature equivalently energy window. Nonetheless, let us proceed to see how results can be derived. We fix a value for 0 in figs. and we have kept this at 0.25 and choose the appropriate value of the volume so that the average number , the system whose results we show. The heaviest composite allowed in the model kmax is also 150. From eqs. and one can derive that the probability that a particular composite with k nucleons does not occur at all is 1 enk and the probability that it occurs at least once or more is enk 1 enk . Note that our nk here is the same as nk s of eqs. and , the average values in the grand canonical ensemble. The probability that k is the highest mass fragment in an event is then given by Pm k enk 1 enk e nk 1 nk 2 .....nkmax From the above eq. one readily derives Pm k 1 Pm k enk 1 1 enk 1 nk then Pm k 1 Pm k . If further both nk 1 and nk are small compared to 1 then Pm k 1 Pm k nk 1 nk Let us turn to the calculation of the probability disribution of the largest fragment as a function of the mass of the largest fragment in the canonical model. A detailed formulation when two kinds of particles are present was given in a recent paper but for competeness, we review the development.There is an enormous number of channels in Eq. . Different channels will have different values for the largest fragment. For example there is a term N 1 N! in the sum of Eq. . In this channel all the fragments and hence also the largest fragment has mass 1. The probability of this channel occurring is from Eq. N 1 N! . The full partition function can be written as 1, 2, 3, ....... kmax . If we construct a QN where we set all s except 1 to be zero then this QN 1, 0, 0, 0.............. N 1 N! and this has the largest mass 1. Consider now constructing a QN with only two s QN 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, ...... . This will have the largest mass sometimes 1 as N 1 N! is still there and sometimes 2 as, for example, in the term 3 2 3! N 6 1 N 6 ! . It then follows that Pm k QN 1, 2, ... k, 0, 0, 0.. QN

Chunk: 1, 2, ... k 1, 0, 0, 0... QN In the above the first term in the numerator takes care of the occurrence of all partitions where the largest fragment is between 1 and k and the second term takes care of all the partitions where the largest fragment is between 1 and k 1. The difference, divided by QN is the desired answer. Since one has the general formula for the probability Pm k , one can compute the average value of the mass of the largest fragment as well as the root mean square deviation. In fact, these have been measured in some experiments and have recently been calculated . But we will not need this for this paper. VI. REPRESENTATIVE RESULTS The probability distribution Pm k of the largest fragment as a function of k where k is the largest fragment in an event is shown in Fig. where the freeze out density 0 is 0.25 and the dissociating system has for the grand canonical ensemble the average 11 value is 150 . The canonical and grand canonical results are quite different but both display bimodality there are two maxima with similar heights , the grand canonical at temperature 5.9 MeV and the canonical at temperature 6.2 MeV. In Fig. we have compared the nk s of the two models. Near the end value 150 the differences are very substantial at all temparatures. At lower values of k they agree very well at .8 MeV, quite well at .2 MeV but gets worse at lower temperatures becoming quite different at .0 MeV. These differences have been noted and discussed before . VII. CONNECTION BETWEEN PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE LARGEST FRAGMENT AND AVERAGE MULTIPLICITY The very first experiments in heavy ion collisions measured nk, the average multiplicity against k. One of the earliest postulates was the following. At low energy nk first falls with k but after reaching a minimum rises again. This is the so called U shape. This shape at lower temperature is an indication that the system will undergo a liquid gas type phase transition. As the energy of collision increases, the height of the maximum on the heavier side will decrease, will then disappear this marks the phase transition temperature . At higher energy, nk decreases monotonically with k. This is discussed in many places including . Basically then one looks at the behaviour of nk as a function of k and energy as one signature of phase transition. Since bimodality in the probability distribution is also a signature of phase transition, we hope to get a connection between Pm k and nk. For bimodality one requires that after the minimum following the first maximum, Pm k will rise again witk k. Similarly in conjectures involving the multiplicity, nk, after reaching a minimum must rise again with k. These two features are intimately related. In the grand canonical model this is very simple to prove. Equation shows that if nk k 1 Pm k and bimodality can happen. The reverse is not true nk k 1 is less than Pm k . There is similar connection in the canonical model. Here it can be proven that on the heavier side , a rise of nk with k guarantees that Pm k will rise with k. In fact it is even more direct than that. For , we have an equality Pm k nk. This can be proven from eq. but there is a an easier proof. We can rewrite Pm k as a sum of 12 terms Pm k P 1 m k P 2 m k P 3 m k ........ where in each of the terms in the right hand side k is the highest mass that occurs but in P 1 m k the composite k occurs only once, in P 2 m k it occurs twice, in P 3 m

Chunk: density . The difference 4 directly shows the fraction of tightly bound pairs that an nihilate on the long ramp. Second, a slower ramp shows vortex activation at lower J T 50 , confirming that free or very loosely bound vortices occur only at higher T lower J . Specifically, the data clearly show a range around J T 1.4 where only tightly bound pairs exist. Figure 3 b quantitatively shows the shift of J T 50 from 1.4 to 1.0 with slower ramp time. We can make a crude mapping of the experimental ramp down time scale to theoretically more accessible vortex antivortex pair sizes as follows In Fig. 3 c , we see the decrease of the saturated low J T vortex density . The right axis shows the inferred number of vortices that survived the ramp. We compare this number of surviving vortices to simulations of a 20 site hexagonal array with random phases. In these simulations we find, on average, a total of 10 vortices, 6 of which occur in nearest neighbor vortex antivortex pairs configuration I in Fig. 3 c , 1.7 occur in configuration II III respectively, and 1.9 occur in larger pairs or as free vortices. Experimentally 11 vortices are observed for the fastest ramps, in good agreement with the expected total number of vortices. For just some what slower ramps of 5 ms, only 3 vortices survive, consistent with only vortices in configuration II III or larger remaining indicated in Fig. 3, top axis . For 30 ms ramps less than 2 vortices remain, according to our simulations spaced by more than 2d 3. Thus we infer that ramps of 30 ms or longer allow time for bound pairs of spacing 2d 3 to decay before we ob serve them. The downward shift of J T 50 in Fig. 3 b thus tells us that loosely bound pairs of size larger than 2d 3, or indeed free vortices, do not appear in quan tity until J T 1.0, whereas more tightly bound vortex pairs appear in large number already for J T 1.4. A further interesting observation concerns the width of the vortex activation curve. The relative width, de termined from fits to data such as the ones shown in Fig. 3 a , is J T 27 73 J T 50 0.3, independent of ramp down duration. This width is neither as broad as in a double well system , where the coherence factor rises over a range J T 27 73 J T 50 1.4, nor as broad as expected from our simulations of an array of uncoupled phases, each fluctuating inde pendently with , for which we find J T 27 73 J T 50 0.85. Presumably collective effects in the highly multiply connected lattice narrow the curve. On the other hand, the width is 3 times larger than the limit due to spatial inhomogeneity in J, suggest ing contributions to the width due to finite size effects or perhaps revealing the intrinsically smooth behavior of vortex activation in the BKT regime. In conclusion, we have probed vortex proliferation in the BKT regime on a 2D lattice of Josephson coupled BECs. Allowing variable time for vortex antivortex pair annihilation before probing the system provides a time to length mapping, which reveals information on the size of pairs with varying J T .

Chunk: determination of the primordial binary content. However, processes involved 1The ten body gravitational calculations of von Hoerner are the earliest N body calculations published. They were continued until the first binary formed, at which point the calculations were halted. 3 in the intervening cluster evolution make this difficult. For example, binaries can be formed and destroyed in a variety of interactions between cluster members Hurley Shara 2002 . Binaries will on average be more massive than single stars and thus are affected differently by mass segregation. Also, the escape rates of single stars and binaries will differ. Finally, the internal evolution of the components of binaries can also lead to binaries destruction. Current simulation techniques have been designed to model these and other processes Aarseth 2003 and have reached the level of sophistication required to produce realistic clus ter models. In this way the link between primordial and current cluster binary populations can be investigated directly e.g. Hurley et al. 2005 Ivanova et al. 2005 . Aarseth conducted an N body simulation starting with 10 000 stars and a 5 binary frequency where notably the stars were drawn from a realistic initial mass function IMF , the cluster was subject to the tidal field of the Galaxy, and both stellar and binary evolution were modelled. This model cluster had a half life of about 2 Gyr at which point the core binary frequency had risen to 20 primarily owing to mass segregation. Thus binaries were not preferentially depleted. In this case it was not necessary to include a large initial binary fraction in order to halt core collapse and yield a significant observed abundance in the central regions. The earlier work of McMillan Hut reported N body simulations of 2 000 stars or less and binary frequencies in the range of 5 20 . They included the Galactic tidal field but only considered point mass dynamics. McMillan Hut showed that there is a criti cal primordial binary frequency of 10 15 below which the binaries are destroyed before the cluster dissolves owing to the tidal field. Furthermore, they found that above this critical value there exists a minimum possible binary mass fraction for the cluster this result could be used with observations of present day binary frequency to place limits on the primordial frequency. We note that the McMillan Hut simulations were restricted to equal mass stars, and the binaries were a factor of two heavier then single stars this could give misleading results when applied to real clusters2. These N body simulations were definitely in the open cluster regime. Dynamical pro cesses which destroy and equally may create cluster binaries are density dependent. In addition, the central stellar density of a cluster is a function of the number, N, of cluster members. Thus, it is not clear that these prior results apply to globular cluster conditions. More recently Ivanova et al. have conducted Monte Carlo simulations of clusters 2 Binaries would naturally be twice as massive as single stars on average if binaries form by random pairings independent of the stellar IMF. In general correlated masses are assumed e.g. Kroupa 1995 although the exact situation is unclear the recent survey of stars in the solar neighborhood and in young open clusters compiled by Halbwachs et al. shows a distribution of mass ratios, q, with a broad peak between 0.2 0.7 but also a sharp peak for .8. 4 with up to 5 105 members and core number densities ranging from 103 106 stars pc 3. They show that an initial binary frequency of 100 is required to produce a current core binary frequency of 10 for a globular cluster such as 47 Tucanae. Depletion of binaries in the cluster core is found to be the result of stellar evolution processes as well as three and four body dynamical interactions. It is our intention in this paper to test these

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0291v2 physics.atom ph 2 Oct 2007 Approaching the Heisenberg limit in an atom laser M. Jeppesen,1 J. Dugu e,1, 2 G. R. Dennis,1 M. T. Johnsson,1 C. Figl,1 N. P. Robins,1 and J. D. Close1 1Australian Research Council Centre Of Excellence for Quantum Atom Optics, Department of Physics, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia 2Laboratoire Kastler Brossel, 24 rue Lhomond, 75231 Paris Cedex 05, France We present experimental and theoretical results showing the improved beam quality and reduced divergence of an atom laser produced by an optical Raman transition, compared to one produced by an RF transition. We show that Raman outcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has on the outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atom laser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of ten for experiments with tight trapping potentials. We show that Raman outcoupling can produce atom lasers whose quality is only limited by the wavefunction shape of the condensate that produces them, typically a factor of 1.3 above the Heisenberg limit. PACS numbers 03.75.Pp,03.75.Mn Experiments in ultracold dilute atomic gases have had an enormous impact on physics. The realization of Bose Einstein condensates BECs , degenerate Fermi gases, BEC BCS crossover systems, and many others have re sulted in many fundamental insights and a wealth of new results in both experiment and theory. One exciting sys tem to emerge from this research is the atom laser, a highly coherent, directional beam of degenerate atoms, controllably released from a BEC . The atom lasers demonstrated so far have produced beams many orders of magnitude brighter than is pos sible with thermal atomic beams . Atom laser beams show great promise for studies of fundamental physics and in high precision measure ments . In the future, it will be possible to produce quadrature squeezing in atoms lasers, to use atom lasers to produce correlations and entanglement between mas sive particles , as well as high precision interferome ters both on earth and in space . For all these it will be crucial to develop atom lasers with output modes that as clean as possible in amplitude and phase, to allow sta ble modematching, just as it was crucial for optical lasers. The beam quality factor M 2, introduced for atom lasers by J. F. Riou et al. , is a measure of how far the beam deviates from the Heisenberg limit, and is defined by M h x px, where x is the beam width, measured at the waist, and px is the transverse momentum spread. An ideal Gaussian beam would therefore have M . A number of exper imental works have shown that the beam quality of an atom laser is strongly affected by the interaction of the outcoupled atoms with the BEC from which it is pro duced . As the atoms fall through the condensate, the repulsive interaction acts as a diverging lens to the outcoupled atoms. This leads to a divergence in the atom laser beam and because the BEC is a non ideal lens a poor quality transverse beam profile. Such behavior may cause problems in mode matching the atom laser beam to another atom laser, a cavity or to a waveg FIG. 1 color online .

Chunk: match experimental data. 2 uide. Experiments on atom lasers in waveguides have produced beams with improved spatial profile . How ever, precision measurements with atom interferometry are likely to require propagation in free space, to avoid introducing noise from the fluctuations in the waveguide itself . In a recent Letter , it was shown that the quality of a free space atom laser is improved by outcoupling from the base of the condensate. Our scheme, however, en ables the production of a high quality atom laser while outcoupling from the center of the condensate. This is desirable for a number of reasons First, because the clas sical noise level is determined by the outcoupling Rabi frequency, then outcoupling from the center, where the density is greatest, gives the highest possible output flux for a given classical noise level . Second, outcoupling from the center allows the longest operating time for a quasicontinuous atom laser since the condensate can be drained completely. Third, outcoupling from the center minimizes the sensitivity of the output coupling to con densate excitations or external fluctuations. In a recent Letter , we have demonstrated a contin uously outcoupled atom laser where the output coupler is a coherent multi photon Raman transition . In this scheme, the atoms receive a momentum kick from the absorption and emission of photons. They leave the con densate more quickly, so that adverse effects due to the mean field repulsion from the condensate are reduced. In this Letter, we report measurements of a substantial improvement in the beam quality M 2 using this outcou pling. In Fig. 1, we show absorption images of atom laser beams outcoupled from the center of a BEC with a negligible momentum kick, b a kick of 0.3 cm s, and 1.1 cm s c . As the kick increases, the divergence is reduced and the beam profile improved. In our experiment, we create 87Rb BECs of 5 105 atoms in the , state via stan dard runaway evaporation of laser cooled atoms. We use a highly stable, water cooled QUIC magnetic trap axial frequency 12 Hz and radial frequency 2 128 Hz, with a bias field of . We control drifts in the magnetic bias by using high stability power supplies and water cooling. This stability allows us to precisely and repeatably address the condensate. We produce the atom laser by transferring the atoms to the untrapped , state and letting them fall under gravity. To outcouple atoms with negligible momentum kick we induce spin flips via an RF field of a frequency corresponding to the Zeeman shift in the center of the condensate. Alternatively, we induce the spin flips via an optical Raman transition. The setup is shown in Fig. 2 a . Two optical Raman beams, sep arated by an angle , propagate in the plane of grav ity and the magnetic trap bias field. The momentum transfer to the atoms through absorption and emission of the photons is 2 hk sin 2 , with k the wave number of FIG. 2 color online a Experimental schematic not to scale showing the BEC, Raman lasers, and trapping coils. b Cross section along the two strong axes of the magnetic trap, showing the BEC, outcoupling surface, and atom laser trajectories.

We can turn the laser power on or offin less than 200 ns using a fast switching AOM in a double pass configuration.

The frequency difference between the AOMs corresponds to the Zeeman plus kinetic energy difference between the initial and final states of the two photon Raman transi tion. We

Chunk: collision probability regardless of N, q should scale as ln N, however N will in any case be limited by memory use which scales as Nn so a fixed q is not unreasonable. 12Rounding errors can affect the accuracy of the momentum calculated this way the impact of this can be minimised by occasionally recomputing the momentum of the circle from scratch. 13 implementations of the split merge step of the cone algorithm also require O Nn storage, albeit with a smaller coefficient. It is worth highlighting also an alternative approach, which though slower, O Nn3 2 , has lower memory consumption and also avoids the small risk inexactness from the check xor. It is similar to the brute force approach, but uses 2 dimensional computational ge ometry tree structures, such as quad trees or k d trees . These involve successive sub divisions of the plane in quadrants, or pairs of rectangles , similarly to what is done in 1 dimensional binary trees. They make it possible to check the stability of a given circle in n time the time is mostly taken by identifying tree cells near the edge of the circle, of which there are O n , giving an overall cost of Nn3 2. The memory use of this form of approach is O N n , simply the space needed to store the stable cone contents.13 4.3 The split merge part of the cone algorithm The split merge part of our cone algorithm is basically that adopted for Run II of the Tevatron . It is shown in detail as algorithm 3. Since it does not depend on the procedure used to find stable cones, it may largely be kept as is. We do however include the following small modifications 1. The run II proposal used Et throughout the split merge procedure. This is not invariant under longitudinal boosts. We replace it with pt, a scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the constituents of the protojet. This ensures that the results are both boost invariant and infrared safe. We note that choosing instead pt a seemingly natural choice, made for example in the code of would have led to IR unsafety in purely hadronic events the question of the variable to be used for the ordering is actually a rather delicate one, and we discuss it in more detail in appendix B.2. 2. We introduce a threshold pt,min below which protojets are discarded step 3 of algo rithm 3 . This parameter is motivated by the discussion in concerning problems associated with an excess of stable cones in seedless algorithms, notably in events with significant pileup. It provides an infrared and collinear safe way of removing the resulting large number of low pt stable cones. By setting it to zero one recovers a be haviour identical to that of the Run II algorithm modulo the replacement Et pt, above , and we believe that in practice zero is actually a sensible default value. We note that a similar parameter is present in PxCone . 13Though here we are mainly interested in exact approaches, one may also examine the question of the speed of the approximate seedless approach of Volobouev . This approach represents the event on a grid and essentially calculates the stability of a cone at each point of the grid using a fast Fourier transformation FFT . In principle, for this procedure to be as good as the exact one, the grid should be fine enough to resolve each distinct cone, which implies that it should have O Nn points therefore the FFT will require O Nn ln Nn time, which is similar in magnitude to the time that is needed by the exact algorithm. An open question remains that of whether a coarser grid might nevertheless be good enough for many practical applications. 14 Algorithm 3 The disambiguated, scalar pt based

Shown a for Tevatron collisions and b for LHC collisions. In addition, we have used Herwig and Pythia to investigate the differences between midpoint and SISCone with parton showering. Both generators give similar results, and we show the results just of Pythia, fig. 9a. The difference at parton level is very similar to what was observed at fixed order. At hadron level without underlying event UE corrections, the difference remains at the level of 1 2 though it changes sign once one includes the underlying event contributions, the difference increases noticeably at lower pt this is because the midpoint algorithm receives somewhat larger UE corrections than SISCone. Since the underlying event is one of the things that is likely to change from Tevatron to LHC, in figure 9b we show similar curves for LHC kinematics. At parton level and at hadron level without the underlying event, the results are essentially the same as for the Tevatron. With the underlying event included, the impact of the missing stable cones in the midpoint algorithm reaches of the order of 10 to 15 , and thus starts to become quite a significant effect. With Herwig, we find that the impact is little smaller because its underlying event is smaller than Pythia s at the LHC. 5.4.2 Jet masses in 3 jet events As well as the inclusive jet pT spectrum, we can also study more exclusive quantities. One example is the jet mass spectrum in multi jet events. Jet masses are potentially of interest for QCD studies, particle mass measurements and new physics searches, where they could be used to identify highly boosted W Z H bosons or top quarks produced in the decays of new heavy particles . The simplest multi jet events in which to study jet masses are 3 jet events. There, the masses of all the jets vanish at the 3 particle level. The first order at which the jet masses become non zero is O 4 s and this is also the order at which differences appear between 26 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 M GeV 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 rel. diff. for d dM2 Mass spectrum of jet 2 midpoint SISCone SISCone NLOJet .7, .5 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 M GeV 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 rel. diff. for d dM2 Mass spectrum of jet 2 midpoint SISCone SISCone NLOJet .7, .5 the SISCone and midpoint algorithms become apparent: this is illustrated in figure 10, where we plot the jet mass spectrum of the second jet for all 3 jet events in the same kinematics as before.

The difference between these two algorithms is again somewhat less pronounced at parton level, but becomes more apparent at hadron level without underlying event UE corrections. With the underlying event included, the difference remains significant, and increases at lower jet mass.

One option is to use sequential recombination jet algorithms, such as the kt and Cam bridge Aachen algorithms , which introduce a distance measure between particles, and repeatedly recombine the closest pair of particles until some stopping criterion is reached. While experimentally these are starting to be investigated , the bulk of measurements are currently carried out with the other class of jet definition, cone jet algorithms see e.g. . In general there are indications that it may be advantageous to use both sequential 2 recombination and cone jet algorithms because of complementary sensitivities to different classes of non perturbative corrections. Cone jet algorithms are inspired by the idea of defining a jet as an angular cone around some direction of dominant energy flow. To find these directions of dominant energy flow, cone algorithms usually take some or all of the event particles as seeds , i.e. trial cone directions. Then for each seed they establish the list of particles in the trial cone, evaluate the sum of their 4 momenta, and use the resulting 4 momentum as a new trial direction for the cone. This procedure is iterated until the cone direction no longer changes, i.e. until one has a stable cone . Stable cones have the property that the cone axis a a four vector coincides with the four vector axis defined by the total momentum of the particles contained in the cone, D pin cone, a 0 , with pin R D pi, a , where D p, a is some measure of angular distance between the four momentum p and the cone axis a, and R is the given opening half angle of the cone, also referred to as the cone radius. Typically one defines D2 p, a yp ya 2 p a 2, where yp, ya and p, a are respectively the rapidity and azimuth of p and a. Two types of problem arise when using seeds as starting points of an iterative search for stable cones. On one hand, if one only uses particles above some momentum threshold as seeds, then the procedure is collinear unsafe. Alternatively if any particle can act as a seed then one needs to be sure that the addition of an infinitely soft particle cannot lead to a new hard stable cone being found, otherwise the procedure is infrared IR unsafe. The second of these problems came to fore in the 1990 s , when it was realised that there can be stable cones that have two hard particles on opposing edges of the cone and no particles in the middle, e.g. for configurations such as p1, p2 1 pt2 pt1 R. In traditional iterative cone algorithms, p1 and p2 each act as seeds and two stable cones are found, one centred on p1, the other centred on p2. The third stable cone, centred between p1 and p2 and containing them

Chunk: and j only overlap through their soft particles, so j cannot be the same jet as j since j by definition overlaps with i through hard particles . By following the remaining part of the loop, we shall show that in the first case all modifications of the hard content are the same in the hard and hard soft events, while, for the second case, the iteration of the loop in the hard soft event does not modify any hard content of the protojets. In this second case, we then proceed to the next iteration of the loop in the hard soft event but stay at the same one for the hard event. C1 The two protojets i and j overlap in their hard content 3,3 We need to compute the fraction of pt shared by the two protojets. Since the hard contents of i j and i j are identical, the fraction of overlap, given by the hard content only, will be the same in the hard and hard soft events. Hence, the decision to split or merge the protojets will be identical. 21As mentioned already, this point is more delicate than it might seem at first sight. We come back to it in the second part of this appendix. 35 3 Since the centres of both protojets are the same in the hard and hard soft events, the decision to attribute a hard particle to one protojet or the other will be the same in both events. Hence splitting will reorganise hard particles in the same way for the hard soft event as for the hard one. 3 In both the hard and the hard soft events, the merging of the two protojets will result in a single protojet with the same hard content. C2 The two protojets i and j overlap through soft particles only 3,3 Since the fraction of pt shared by the protojets will be 0 in the limit eq. , the two protojets will be split. 3 In the splitting, only shared particles, i.e. soft particles, will be reassigned to the first or second protojet. The hard content is therefore left untouched, as is the pt ordering of the protojets. 3 At the end of the splitting merging of the overlapping protojets, we have to consider the two possible overlap cases separately in the first case, the hard contents of the protojets are modified in the same way for the hard and hard soft event. This case is thus IR safe. In the second case, the iteration of the loop in the hard soft event does not correspond to any iteration of the loop in the hard event. However the hard content of the protojets in the hard soft event is not modified and the pt ordering of the jets remains identical at the next iteration of the hard soft loop, the new j may once again have just soft overlap with i and the loop will thus continue iterating, splitting the soft parts of the jets, but leaving the hard content of the jets unchanged. This will continue until j corresponds to the j of the hard event, i.e. we encounter case 1.22 Therefore even though we may have gone around the loop more times in the hard soft event, we do always reach a stage where the split merge operation in the hard soft event coincides with that in the hard event, and so this part of the procedure is infrared safe. 3,3 Up to possible intermediate loops involving case 2 above, when the protojet i has no overlapping protojets in the hard event, the corresponding i in the hard soft event has no overlaps either. Final jets will thus be added one by one with the same hard content in the hard and hard soft events. This completes the proof that the SISCone algorithm is IR safe, modulo subtleties related to

Chunk: the ordering variable, as discussed below. Regarding the merge identical protojets MIP procedure 22Note that the second case can only happen a finite number of times between two occurrences of the first case as the pt ordering is not modified during the second case, each time around the loop the overlap will involve a j with a lower pt than in the previous iteration, until one reaches the j that corresponds to j. 36 3 In algorithm 3, we do not automatically merge protojets appearing with the same content during the split merge process. This is IR safe. If instead we allow for two identical protojets to be automatically merged, then when two protojets have the same hard content but differ as a result of their soft content, they are automatically merged in the hard event but not in the hard soft event. This in turn leads to IR unsafety of the final jets. A final comment concerns collinear safety and cocircular points. When defining a candidate cone from a pair of points, if additional points lie on the edge of the cone, then there is an ambiguity as to whether they will be included in the cone. From the geometrical point of view, this special case of cocircular points on a circle of radius R can be treated by considering all permutations of the the cocircular points being included or excluded from the circle contents. SISCone contains code to deal with this general issue. The case of identically collinear particles, though a specific example of cocircularity, also adds the problem that a circle cannot properly be defined from two identical points. For explicit collinear safety we thus simply merge any collinear particles into a single particle, step 2 of algorithm 2. Given the resulting collinear safe set of protojets, the split merge steps preserve collinear safety, since particles at identical y coordinates are treated identically. B.2 Split merge ordering variable Suppose we use some generic variable v which may be pt, Et, mt, pt, etc. to decide the order in which we select protojets for the split merge process. A crucial assumption in the proof of IR safety is that two jets with different hard content will also have substantially different values for v, i.e. the ordering of the v s will not be changed by soft modifications. If this is not the case then the choice of the hard protojets that enter a given split merge loop iteration can be modified by soft momenta, with a high likelihood that the final jets will also be modified. At first sight one might think that whatever variable is used, it will have different values for distinct hard protojets. However, momentum conservation and coincident masses of identical particles can introduce relations between the kinematic characteristics of distinct protojets. Some care is therefore needed so as to ensure that these relations do not lead to degeneracies in the ordering, with consequent ambiguities and infrared unsafety for the final jets. In particular Two protojets can have equal and opposite transverse momenta if between them they contain all particles in the event and the event has no missing energy or ignored particles such as isolated leptons . It is probably fair to assume that no two protojets will have identical longitudinal components, since in pp collisions the hard partonic reaction does not occur in the pp centre of mass frame. Two protojets will have identical masses if they each stem exclusively from the same kind of massive particle. The two massive particles may be undecayed e.g. fully reconstructed b hadrons or decayed top, W, Z, H, or some non standard new 37 particle , or even one decayed and the other not some hypothetical particle with a long lifetime .23 In the second case we can assume that two identical decayed particles have different decay planes, because there is a vanishing phase space for

Chunk: confusion surrounding the nomenclature of the seedless and midpoint algorithms while it seems that the measurement was carried out with a true midpoint algorithm, the calculation probably used the midpoint as defined in section 3.4.2 of cf. footnote 2 , which is actually the seedless algorithm, i.e. the measurements and theoretical predictions are based on different algorithms. 5This option was actually mentioned in but rejected at the time as impractical. 8 etc... Figure 2 Representation of points on a line and the places where a sliding segment has a change in its set of enclosed points. parton shower or hadron level events, with dozens or hundreds of particles, N2N time is prohibitive. A solution can only be considered realistic if it is polynomial in N, preferably with not too high a power of N. As mentioned in the introduction, approximate procedures for implementing seedless cone jet algorithms have been proposed in the past . These rely on considering the momentum flow into discrete calorimeter towers rather than considering particles. As such they are not entirely suitable for examining the full range event levels, which go from fixed order few partons , via parton shower level many partons and hadron level, to detector level which has both tracking and calorimetry information. 4.1 One dimensional example To understand how one might construct an efficient exact seedless cone jet algorithm, it is helpful to first examine a one dimensional analogue of the problem. The aim is to identify all solutions to eq. , but just for weighted points on a line. The equivalent of a cone of radius R is a segment of length 2R. Rather than immediately looking for stable segments one instead looks for all distinct ways in which the segment can enclose a subset of the points on the line. Then for each separate enclosure one calculates its centroid C weighted with the pt of the particles and verifies whether the segment centred on C encloses the same set of points as the original enclosure. If it does then C is the centre of a stable segment. A simple way of finding all distinct segment enclosures is illustrated in fig.2. First one sorts the points into order on the line. One then places the segment far to the left and slides it so that it goes infinitesimally beyond the leftmost point. This is a first enclosure. Then one slides the segment again until its right edge encounters a new point or the left edge encounters a contained point. Each time either edge encounters a point, the point content of the segment changes and one has a new distinct enclosure. Establishing the stability of each enclosure is trivial, since one knows how far the segment can move in each direction without changing its point content so if the centroid is such that the segment remains within these limits, the enclosure corresponds to a stable segment. The computational complexity of the above procedure, N ln N, is dominated by the need to sort the points initially there are O N distinct enclosures and, given the sorted list, finding the next point that will enter or leave an edge costs O time, as does updating the weighted centroid assuming rounding errors can be neglected , so that the time not associated with the sorting step is O N . 9 a b c d Figure 3 a Some initial circular enclosure b moving the circle in a random direction until some enclosed or external point touches the edge of the circle c pivoting the circle around the edge point until a second point touches the edge d all circles defined by pairs of edge points leading to the same circular enclosure. 4.2 The two dimensional case 4.2.1 General approach The solution to the full problem can be seen as a 2 dimensional generalisation of the above procedure.6 The key idea is again that

We start with considering the effect of the Coulomb interaction. In a detailed treatment of this correction one should include the realistic form factors of the mesons, which cut offat short distances the difference in the electromagnetic interactions between the charged and neutral mesons. In the present discussion we replace for simplicity the gradual cutoffof the Coulomb interaction by an abrupt cutoffat an effective range , where generally ac a 4.

The latter line in Eq. shows few first terms of the expansion of the integral in the parameter pac . This expansion illustrates the behavior of the correction toward the threshold. For the purpose of this illustration one can consider first the simpler expression in Eq. .

The real part of the integral in Eq. is singular at small pac, but it multiplies in Eq. the factor sin 1. The P wave scattering phase in its turn is proportional at small momenta to p3 1 pa 3, so that the overall contribution of the real part of the integral is not singular at the threshold either. Considering a more general expression for the Coulomb effect for the case of an isotopically mixed source, following from the equation , one can readily arrive at the same conclusion that the singular in pac real part of the integral does not lead to an actual singularity, since it only enters the ratio Rc n multiplied by a combination of the phases 0 and 1 cf.

Chunk: QED QCD exponentiation. For QED QCD we find that full MC event generator realization is possible in a way that combines our calculus with HERWIG and PYTHIA in principle. Semi analytical results for QED and QCD threshold effects agree with literature on Z production. As QED is at the .3 level, it is needed for LHC theory predictions at 1 . The cor responding analysis of the W production is in progress. We have illustrated a firm theoretical basis for the realization of the complete O 2 s, s, 2 re sults needed for the FNAL LHC RHIC ILC physics and all of the latter are in progress.

Chunk: n SN A n TOPOLOGICAL TYPES OF PARAMETRIZED ARRANGEMENTS 5 for which the induced maps g f SN A n SN A n , and f g SN B n SN B n are diagram homotopic to IdSN A n and IdSN B n , respectively. Translating these topological definitions into the language of arrangements, we say that Definition 1.6 topological type of an arrangement . Two arrangements A, B are homeomorphic respectively homotopy equivalent, stable homotopy equivalent if there exists a diagram preserving homeomorphism respectively homotopy equiva lence, stable homotopy equivalence between them. Remark 1.7. Note that, since two definable sets might be stable homotopy equiv alent, without being homotopy equivalent see 18, pp. 462 , and also homotopy equivalent without being homeomorphic, the notions of homeomorphism type, ho motopy type and stable homotopy type are each strictly weaker than the previous one. The main results of this paper can now be stated. 1.5. Main Results. Let S R be an o minimal structure over R, T Rk1 k2 l a closed and bounded definable set, and let 1 Rk1 k2 l Rk1 k2 respectively, 2 Rk1 k2 l Rl, 3 Rk1 k2 Rk2 denote the projections onto the first k1 k2 respectively, the last l, the last k2 co ordinates. For any collection T, 1, 2 sets, and z Rk2, we will denote by Az the collection of sets, , where Ai, 1 3 z , 1 i n. A fundamental theorem in o minimal geometry is Hardt s trivialization theorem Theorem 4.2 below which says that there exists a definable partition of Rk2 into a finite number of definable sets i I such that for each i I, all fibers Az with z Ti are definably homeomorphic. A very natural question is to ask for an upper bound on the size of this partition which will also give an upper bound on the number of homeomorphism types amongst the arrangements Az, z Rk2 . Hardt s theorem is a corollary of the existence of cylindrical cell decompositions of definable sets proved in see also . When A is a T, 1, 2 family for some fixed definable set T Rk1 k2 l, with 1 Rk1 k2 l Rk1 k2, 2 Rk1 k2 l Rl, 2 Rk1 k2 Rk2 the usual projections, and , the quantitative definable cylindrical cell decomposition theorem in gives a doubly exponential in k1k2 upper bound on the cardinality of I and hence on the number of homeomorphism types amongst the arrangements Az, z Rk2. A tighter say singly exponential bound on the number of homeomorphism types of the fibers would be very interesting but is unknown at present. Note that we cannot hope for a bound which is better than singly exponential because the lower bounds on the number of topological types proved in also applies in our situation. In this paper we give tighter singly exponential upper bounds on the number of homotopy types occurring amongst the fibers Az, z Rk2. We prove the following theorems. The first theorem gives a bound on the number of stable homotopy types of the arrangements Az, z Rk2, while the second theorem gives a slightly worse bound for homotopy types. 6 SAUGATA BASU Theorem 1.8. There exists a constant T 0 such that for any collection T, 1, 2 sets the number of distinct stable homotopy types amongst the arrangements Az, z Rk2 is bounded by C n k1 1 k2. If we replace stable homotopy type by homotopy type, we obtain a slightly weaker bound. Theorem 1.9. There exists a constant T 0 such that for any collection T, 1, 2 sets the number of distinct homotopy types occuring amongst the arrangements Az, z Rk2 is bounded by C n k1 3 k2. 2.

Chunk: 1 1 2hV V Z only in its form , and note that, after using Eq. , the jA in Eq. takes the form h with Z0V 2h 1 2h V V , and it is possible to rescale h away everywhere 2hV V. 16 of spin phase space degrees of freedom XM, P M, VA, V A. Then the Sp 2, R and kappa gauge symmetries that act on XM, P M, VA, V A can be gauge fixed for any spin h, to give the specific twistor transform for any of the systems under consideration. We have already seen in Eq. that the twistor transform relates the conserved SU 2, 2 charges in twistor and phase space versions. Let us now verify that provides the transformation between the twistor action and the spin phase space action . We compute the canonical structure as follows Z d Z h Z h Z d Z 1 1 2hV V 1 1 2hV V Z Z d Z 1 1 2hV V 1 1 2hV V Z Z 1 1 2hV V Z Z d X P Tr i t t 1 L 0 0 0 The last form is the canonical structure of spin phase space as given in . To prove this result we used Eq. , footnote , and the other properties of Z including Eqs. 6.4 6.7 , as well as the constraints X , and dropped some total derivatives. This proves that the canonical properties of Z h determine the canonical properties of spin phase space degrees of freedom and vice versa. Then, including the terms that impose the constraints, the twistor action and the phase space action are equivalent. Of course, this is expected since they are both gauge fixed versions of the master action , but is useful to establish it also directly via the general twistor transform given in Eq. . VII. QUANTUM MASTER EQUATION, SPECTRUM, AND DUALITIES In this section we derive the quantum algebra of the gauge invariant observables J B A and J0 which are the conserved charges of SU 2, 2 U R. Since these are gauge invariant symmetry currents they govern the system in any of its gauge fixed versions, including in any of its versions listed in section I . From the quantum algebra we deduce the constraints among the physical observables J B A ,J0 and quantize the theory covariantly. Among other things, we compute the Casimir eigenvalues of the unitary irreducible representation of SU 2, 2 which classifies the physical states in any of the gauge fixed version of the theory 17 with the different 1T physics interpretations listed in section I . The simplest way to quantize the theory is to use the twistor variables, and from them compute the gauge invariant properties that apply in any gauge fixed version. We will apply the covariant quantization approach, which means that the constraint due to the U gauge symmetry will be applied on states. Since the quantum variables will generally not satisfy the constraints, we will call the quantum twistors in this section ZA, ZA to distinguish them from the classical Z h A , Z h A of the previous sections that were constrained at the classical level. So the formalism in this section can also be applied to the high spin theories discussed in several footnotes up to this point in the paper by ignoring the constraint on the states. According to the twistor action ZA and i ZA or equivalently and i are canon ical conjugates. Therefore the quantum rules equivalent to spin phase space quantum rules are ZA, ZB B A . These quantum rules, as well as the action, are manifestly invariant under SU 2, 2 . In covariant SU 2, 2 quantization the Hilbert space contains states which do not obey the U constraint on the twistors. At the

Chunk: Similar generalizations can be used with our present better develped methods and richer set of groups mentioned above to explore various corners of M theory. One of the projects in 2T physics is to take advantage of its flexible gauge fixing mechanisms in the context of 2T physics field theory. Applying this concept to the 2T physics version of the Standard Model will generate duals to the Standard Model in 3 1 dimensions. The study of the duals could provide some non perturbative or other physical information on the usual Standard Model. This program is about to be launched in the near future . Applying the twistor techniques developed here to 2T physics field theory should shed light on how to connect the Standard Model with a twistor version. This could lead to further insight and to new computational techniques for the types of twistor computations that proved to be useful in QCD . Our new models and methods can also be applied to the study of high spin theories by generalizing the techniques in which are closely related to 2T physics. The 30 high spin version of our model has been discussed in many of the footnotes, and can be supersymmetrized and written in higher dimensions as outlined above in this section. The new ingredient from the 2T point of view is the bosonic spinor VA and the higher symmetry, such as SU 2, 3 and its generalizations in higher dimensions or with supersymmetry. The massless particle gauge of our theory in 3 1 dimensions coincides with the high spin studies in . Our theory of course applies broadly to all the spinning systems that emerge in the other gauges, not only to massless particles. The last three sections on the quantum theory discussed in this paper would apply also in the high spin version of our theory. The more direct 4 2 higher dimensional quantization of high spin theories including the spinor VA or its generalizations V a A is obtained from our SU 2, 3 quantum formalism in the last section. One can consider applying the bosonic spinor that worked well in the particle case to strings and branes. This may provide new string backgrounds with spin degrees of freedom other than the familiar Neveu Schwarz or Green Schwarz formulations that involve fermions.

Chunk: in the trace, and therefore the action becomes n i ZA ZA i Z5 Z5 A Z5Z5 2h o . Here Z5 Z5 drops out as a total derivative since the magnitude of the complex number Z5 is a constant . Furthermore, we must take into account ZAZA 1. Then we see that the 2T physics 11 action reduces to the twistor action with the gauge choice 5. Next let us gauge fix the 2T physics action to a manifestly SU 2, 2 SO 4, 2 invariant version in flat 4 2 dimensions, in terms of the phase space spin degrees of freedom XM, P M, VA, V A. For this we use the SU 2, 2 U left symmetry to gauge fix g gauge fix g t V SU 2, 3 SU 2, 2 U left The coset element t V is parameterized by the SU 2, 2 spinor V and its conjugate 2,2 and given by the 5 5 SU 2, 3 matrix6 t V 1 2hV V 1 2 0 0 1 2h V V 1 2 1 2hV 2h V 1 . The factor 2h is inserted for a convenient normalization of V. Note that the first matrix commutes with the second one, so it can be written in either order. The inverse of the group element is t 1 V 2,3 t 2,3 V , as can be checked explicitly t V t V 1. Inserting this gauge in the action becomes X P 1 2AijXi Xj 1 2 MNLMN 2h A V LV 1 2h V V 1 Z d 1 2 ij D XM i XN j MN 2h A V LV 1 2h V V 1 where D XM XM i A j i XM j MNXiN is a covariant derivative for local Sp 2, R as well as local SU 2, 2 SO 4, 2 but with a composite SO 4, 2 connection MN V given conveniently in the following forms 1 2 MN i t t 1 SU 2,2 , or 1 2 i t t 1 L 0 0 0 . Thus, is the SU 2, 2 projection of the SU 2, 3 Cartan connection and given explicitly as 1 2 MN V V V V V V V V V V V V V V 1 2h V V 1 1 2h V V h V V V V 1 4 V V V V 1 2h V V 5 In the high spin version of without A see footnote , we replace p ZAZA and after dropping a total derivative, the twistor equivalent becomes Sall n i ZA ZA ZZ o . For a more covariant version that displays the SU 2, 3 global symmetry, we introduce a new U gauge field for the overall phase of ZA Z5 and write Sall n i ZA ZA i Z5 Z5 B ZAZA Z5Z5 o . 6 Arbitrary fractional powers of the matrix 1 2hV V are easily computed by expanding in a series and then resuming to obtain 1 2hV V 1 V V 1 2h V V 1 V V. 12 The action 5.4,5.5 is manifestly invariant under global SU 2, 2 SO 4, 2 rotations, and under local U phase transformations applied on VA, V A. The conserved global symmetry currents J and J0 can be derived either directly from by using Noether s theorem, or by inserting the gauge fixed form of g t V into Eq. 7 J 2,3 t 1 L 0 0 0 t V L 1 1 2hV V 1 4J0, V LV 1 2h V V V LV 1 1 2h V V According to the equation of motion for A that follows from the action we must have the following constraint this means U gauge invariant physical sector V LV 1 2h V . Therefore, in the physical sector

We would also like to thank CliffWill for encouraging one of us to study the PPN formalism and Pablo Laguna for suggesting one of us to look into the PPN expansion of CS gravity. We would also like to thank R. Jackiw, R. Wagoner and Ben Owen for enlightening discussions and comments. 12 APPENDIX A PPN POTENTIALS In this appendix, we present explicit expressions for the PPN potentials used to parameterize the metric in Eq. . These potentials are the following U Z x x d3x , Vi Z v i x x d3x , Wi Z v j x x j x x i x x 3 d3x , W Z x x i x x 3 x x i x x x x i x x d3x d3x , 1 Z v 2 x x d3x , 2 Z U x x d3x , 3 Z x x d3x , 4 Z p x x d3x , A Z h v i x x ii2 x x d3x , X Z x x d3x . A1 These potentials satisfy the following relations , vi, 2 v2, 2 U, 2 , 2 p, A2 The potential X is sometimes referred to as the super potential because it acts as a potential for the Newtonian potential. APPENDIX B LINEARIZATION OF THE COTTON TENSOR In this appendix, we present some more details on the derivation of the linearized Cotton tensor to second order. We begin with the definition of the Cotton tensor in terms of the symmetrization operator, namely C 1 g h D f o D R D f R i . B1 Using the symmetries of the Levi Civita and Riemann tensor, as well as the fact that f depends only on time, we can simplify the Cotton tensor to C g 1 f h o 0 R , o 0 R 1 2 0 o R . B2 Noting that the determinant of the metric is simply , so that g , we can identify four terms in the Cotton tensor C f o 0 h LR , i , C f o 0 h h LR , i , C f o 0 h L i h LR i , C f 2 o h L 0 i h LR i , C f o 0 h QR , i , B3 where the L operator stands for the linear part of its operand, while the Q operator isolates the quadratic part of its operand. For example, if we act L and Q on 1 h n, where n is some integer, we obtain h L 1 h , h Q 1 h n 1 2 h2. B4 Let us now compute each of these terms separately. The first four terms are given by C f 2 o 0 h , h , , C f 2 h o 0 h , h , , C f 4 o 0 h , h , h , h h , h , h, , C f 4 o 2h0 , h ,0 h , h , . B5 The last term of the Cotton tensor is simply the deriva tive of the Ricci tensor which we already calculated to second order in Eq. . In order to avoid notation clut ter, we shall not present it again here, but instead we combine all the Cotton tensor pieces to obtain C f 2 o 0 h , h , f 2 o 0 h h , h , 1 2 2h , h , B6 h 2h , h, 2 QR , i f 4 o 2h0 , h ,0 h , h , O h 3 13 where its

Chunk: metric perturbation. The Cotton tensor changes the characteristic behav ior of the Einstein equations by forcing them to become third order instead of second order. Third order par tial differential equations are common in boundary layer theory . However, in CS gravity, the third order con tributions are multiplied by a factor of f and we shall treat this function as a small independent expansion pa rameter. Therefore, the change in characteristics in the modified field equations can also be treated perturba tively, which is justified because eventhough f might be enhanced by standard model currents, extra dimensions or a vanishing string coupling, it must still carry some type of mass suppression. The trace reversed form of the field equations is useful because it allows us to immediately find a formal solution. Inverting the D Alambertian operator we obtain H 16 1 T 1 2g T O h 2, where we have defined an effective metric perturbation as H h f o 0 h , . Note that this formal solution is identical to the formal PN solution to the field equations in the limit f 0. Also note that the second term in Eq. is in essence a curl operator acting on the metric. This antisymmetric operator naturally forces the trace of the CS correction to vanish, as well as the 00 component and the symmetric spatial part. From the formal solution to the modified field equa tions, we immediately identify the only two possible non zero CS contributions a coupling to the vector compo nent of the metric h0i and coupling to the transverse traceless part of the spatial metric hT T ij . The latter has already been studied in the gravitational wave con text and it vanishes identically if we require the spatial sector of the metric perturbation to be confor mally flat. The former coupling is a new curl type contri bution to the metric perturbation that, to our knowledge, had so far been neglected both by the string theory and PPN communities. In fact, as we shall see in later sec tions, terms of this type will force us to introduce a new PPN parameter that is proportional to the curl of certain PPN potentials. Let us conclude this section by pushing the formal so lution to the modified field equations further to obtain a formal solution in terms of the actual metric perturba tion h . Combining Eqs. and we arrive at the differential equation h f o 0 h , 16 1 T 1 2g T O h 2. Since we are searching for perturbations about the gen eral relativistic solution, we shall make the ansatz h h GR f O h 2, where h GR is the solution predicted by general relativity h GR 16 1 T 1 2g T , and where is an unknown function we are solving for. Inserting this ansatz into Eq. we obtain f o 0 , 16 o 0 1 T 1 2g T . We shall neglect the second term on the left hand side be cause it would produce a second order correction. Such conclusion was also reached when studying parity viola tion in GR to explain certain features of the CMB . We thus obtain the formal solution 16 o 0 1 T 1 2g T and the actual metric perturbation to linear order be comes h 16 1 T 1 2 T 16 f o kli 1 i T l,k 1 2 i lT,k O h 2, 6 where we have used some properties of the Levi Civita symbol to simplify this expression. The procedure pre sented here is general enough that it can be directly ap plied to study CS gravity in the PPN framework, as well as possibly find PN solutions to CS gravity. IV.

Chunk: the field equations and obtain a solution in the form of a PN se ries. This solution then allows us to read offthe PPN parameters by comparing it to the standard PPN super metric Eq. . In this section we shall follow closely the methods of and and indices shall be manipulated with the Minkowski metric, unless otherwise specified. Let us begin by expanding the field equations to second order in the metric perturbation. Doing so we find that the Ricci and Cotton tensors are given to second order by R 1 2 h 2h , h, 1 2 h 2h , h , h , 1 2h , h , h , h , h , h , 1 2 h, 2h , h , 2h , O h 3, C f 2 o 0 h , h , f 2 o 0 h h , h , 1 2 2h , h , h 2h , h, 2 QR , i f 4 o 2h0 , h , 0 h , h , f 2 h o 0 h , h , f 2 o 0 h , h , h O h 3. where index contraction is carried out with the Minkowski metric and where we have not assumed any gauge condition. The operator Q takes the quadratic part of its operand of O h 2 and it is explained in more detail in Appendix B, where the derivation of the expan sion of the Cotton tensor is presented in more detail. In this derivation, we have used the definition of the Levi Civita tensor o g 1 2 o 1 1 2h o O h 2, o g 1 2 o 1 1 2h o O h 2. Note that the PN expanded version of the linearized Ricci tensor of Eq. agrees with previous results . Also note that if the Lorentz condition is enforced, several terms in both expressions vanish identically and the Cot ton tensor to first order reduces to Eq. , which agrees with previous results . Let us now specialize the analysis to the standard PPN gauge. For this purpose, we shall impose the following gauge conditions hjk,k 1 2h, , h0k,k 1 2hkk, , where hkk is the spatial trace of the metric perturbation. Note that the first equation is the PN expansion of one of the Lorentz gauge conditions, while the second equation is not. This is the reason why the previous equations where not expanded in the Lorentz gauge. Nonetheless, such a gauge condition does not uniquely fix the coordi nate system, since we can still perform an infinitesimal gauge transformation that leaves the modified field equa tions invariant. One can show that the Lorentz and PPN gauge are related to each other by such a gauge transfor mation. In the PPN gauge, then, the Ricci tensor takes the usual form ,ih00,i 1 2hijh00,ij O , ,0i O , , which agrees with previous results , while the Cotton tensor reduces to , f o 0kli 2h0l,k O , f o 0kl i 2hj l,k O , ij i j is the Laplacian of flat space see Ap pendix B for the derivation of Eq. . Note again the explicit appearance of two coupling terms of the Cotton 7 tensor to the metric perturbation one to the transverse traceless part of the spatial metric and the other to the vector metric perturbation. The PN expansions of the linearized Ricci and Cotton tensor then allow us to solve the modified field equations in the PPN framework. V. PPN SOLUTION OF CS GRAVITY In this section we shall proceed to systematically solve the modified field equation following the standard PPN iterative procedure . We shall begin with the 00 and ij components of the metric to O , and then proceed with the 0i components to O and the 00 component

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0301v1 cs.CC 3 Apr 2007 Differential recursion and differentially algebraic functions Akitoshi Kawamura Department of Computer Science University of Toronto Moore introduced a class of real valued recursive functions by analogy with Kleene s formulation of the standard recursive functions. While his concise def inition inspired a new line of research on analog computation, it contains some technical inaccuracies. Focusing on his primitive recursive functions, we pin down what is problematic and discuss possible attempts to remove the ambiguity regarding the behavior of the differential recursion operator on partial functions. It turns out that in any case the purported relation to differentially algebraic functions, and hence to Shannon s model of analog computation, fails. 1. Introduction There are several different kinds of theoretical models that talk about computability and complexity of real functions. Computable Analysis and some other equivalent models use approximation in one way or another to bring real numbers into the framework of the standard Computability Theory that deals with discrete data in discrete time. Another well known model is the Blum Shub Smale model in which continuous quantities are treated as an entity in themselves but the machine still works with discrete clock ticks. A third approach is analog computation in which not only are the data real valued, but also the transition takes place in continuous time . One of the oldest and the best studied models of such computation is Shannon s General Purpose Analog Computer that models the Differential Analyzer , a computing device built and put to use during the thirties through the fifties. The GPAC, after some refinements , was shown capable of generating in a sense all and only the differentially algebraic functions. We will explore this class in Section 2 and show that it can be characterized in many different ways. Little is known about how such analog models relate to the standard digital computabil ity. Moore addressed this question for his new function classes that also try to express Presented at the Second Conference on Computability in Europe CiE 2006 , Swansea, Wales, UK, July 2006. Supported in part by Research Fellowship DC1, 18 11700 of the Japan Society for Promotion of Science while the author was at Tokyo Institute of Technology. 1 the power of GPAC like computation. In imitation of Kleene s characterization of the usual recursive functions, these classes are defined as the closures under certain operators that are supposedly real number versions of primitive recursion and minimization. He makes the following claims, among others, that relate his classes of real primitive recursive and real re cursive functions to analog and digital computation, respectively 13, Propositions 9 and 13 . Claim 1. Real primitive recursive functions are differentially algebraic.1 Claim 2. Each partial recursive function on the nonnegative integers in the standard sense is a restriction of some real recursive function. Despite its impact on the subsequent study on the classes and their variants , his work lacked formality in some ways, as already pointed out . In fact, the definition of the classes suffers from ambiguity. In Section 3 of this paper, we reformulate Moore s theory up to the real primitive recursive functions in a mathematically sound way. With the aid of the preparation in Section 2, we show that, even though our formulation of the class seems the most restrictive possible, Claim 1 fails. In section 4, we discuss some issues about classes other than the real primitive recursive functions, including Claim 2. Throughout the paper, we write N, Z, R for the sets of nonnegative integers including 0 , integers and real numbers, respectively. Partial functions In this paper, a function f Rm Rn may be partial, as opposed to total that is, the set dom f of x Rm for which the value f x Rn is defined is allowed to be a proper subset of Rm.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0302v2 math.ST 6 Apr 2007 SPLINE SINGLE INDEX PREDICTION MODEL Li Wang and Lijian Yang University of Georgia and Michigan State University Abstract For the past two decades, single index model, a special case of projection pursuit regres sion, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the high dimensional problem in nonparamet ric regression. In this paper, based on weakly dependent sample, we investigate the single index prediction SIP model which is robust against deviation from the single index model. The single index is identified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of the response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is a genuine single index function. A poly nomial spline estimator is proposed for the single index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root n consistent and asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which is sufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension within seconds. Simulation experiments have provided strong evidence that corroborates with the asymptotic theory. Appli cation of the proposed procedure to the rive flow data of Iceland has yielded superior out of sample rolling forecasts. Key words and phrases B spline, geometric mixing, knots, nonparametric regression, root n rate, strong consistency. 1. Introduction Let XT i , Yi n n d 1 dimensional strictly stationary process following the heteroscedastic model Xi Xi i, m Xi E Yi Xi , in which E i Xi 0, E 2 i Xi 1, 1 i n. The d variate functions m, are the unknown mean and standard deviation of the response Yi conditional on the predictor vector Xi, often estimated nonparametrically. In what follows, we let XT , Y, have the stationary distribution of XT i , Yi, i . When the dimension of X is high, one unavoidable issue is the curse of dimensionality , which refers to the poor convergence rate of nonparametric esti mation of general multivariate function. Much effort has been devoted to the circumventing of this difficulty. In the words of Xia, Tong, Li and Zhu , there are essentially two approaches function approximation and dimension reduction. A favorite function approxima tion technique is the generalized additive model advocated by Hastie and Tibshirani , Address for correspondence Lijian Yang, Department of Statistics and Probability, Michigan State Univer sity, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA. E mail yang stt.msu.edu 2 LI WANG AND LIJIAN YANG see also, for example, Mammen, Linton and Nielsen , Huang and Yang , Xue and Yang 2006 a, b , Wang and Yang . An attractive dimension reduction method is the single index model, similar to the first step of projection pursuit regression, see Friedman and Stuetzle , Hall , Huber , Chen . The basic appeal of single index model is its simplicity the d variate function m x m x1, ..., xd is expressed as a univariate function of xT 1 xp 0,p. Over the last two decades, many authors had devised various intelligent estimators of the single index coefficient vector 0,1, ..., 0,d T , for instance, Powell, Stock and Stoker , H ardle and Stoker , Ichimura , Klein and Spady , H ardle, Hall and Ichimura , Horowitz and H ardle , Carroll, Fan, Gijbels and Wand , Xia and Li , Hristache, Juditski and Spokoiny . More recently, Xia, Tong, Li and Zhu proposed the minimum average variance estimation MAVE for several index vectors. All the aforementioned methods assume that the d variate regression function m x is exactly a univariate function of some xT 0 and obtain a root n consistent estimator of 0. If this model is misspecified m is not a genuine single index function , however, a goodness of fit test then becomes necessary and the estimation of 0 must be redefined, see Xia, Li, Tong and Zhang . In this paper, instead of presuming that underlying

Chunk: true function m is a single index function, we estimate a univariate function g that optimally approximates the multivariate function m in the sense of g E m X XT , where the unknown parameter 0 is called the SIP coefficient, used for simple interpretation once estimated XT 0 is the latent SIP variable and g is a smooth but unknown function used for further data summary, called the link prediction function. Our method therefore is clearly interpretable regardless of the goodness of fit of the single index model, making it much more relevant in applications. We propose estimators of 0 and g based on weakly dependent sample, which includes many existing nonparametric time series models, that are i computationally expedient and ii theoretically reliable. Estimation of both 0 and g has been done via the kernel smoothing techniques in existing literature, while we use polynomial spline smoothing. The greatest advantages of spline smoothing, as pointed out in Huang and Yang , Xue and Yang 2006 b are its simplicity and fast computation. Our proposed procedure involves two stages estimation of 0 by some n consistent , minimizing an empirical version of the mean squared error, R E 2 spline smoothing of Y on XT to obtain a cubic spline estimator g of g. The best single index approximation to m x is then m x g xT . Under geometrically strong mixing condition, strong consistency and n rate asymptotic SINGLE INDEX PREDICTION MODEL 3 normality of the estimator of the SIP coefficient 0 in are obtained. Proposition 2.2 is the key in understanding the efficiency of the proposed estimator. It shows that the derivatives of the risk function up to order 2 are uniformly almost surely approximated by their empirical versions. Practical performance of the SIP estimators is examined via Monte Carlo examples. The estimator of the SIP coefficient performs very well for data of both moderate and high dimension d, of sample size n from small to large, see Tables 1 and 2, Figures 1 and 2. By taking advantages of the spline smoothing and the iterative optimization routines, one reduces the computation burden immensely for massive data sets. Table 2 reports the computing time of one simulation example on an ordinary PC, which shows that for massive data sets, the SIP method is much faster than the MAVE method. For instance, the SIP estimation of a 200 dimensional 0 from a data of size 1000 takes on average mere 2.84 seconds, while the MAVE method needs to spend 2432.56 seconds on average to obtain a comparable estimates. Hence on account of criteria i and ii , our method is indeed appealing. Applying the proposed SIP procedure to the rive flow data of Iceland, we have obtained superior forecasts, based on a 9 dimensional index selected by BIC, see Figure 5. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives details of the model spec ification, proposed methods of estimation and main results. Section 3 describes the actual procedure to implement the estimation method. Section 4 reports our findings in an extensive simulation study. The proposed SIP model and the estimation procedure are applied in Section 5 to the rive flow data of Iceland. Most of the technical proofs are contained in the Appendix. 2. The Method and Main Results 2.1. Identifiability and definition of the index coefficient It is obvious that without constraints, the SIP coefficient vector 0,1, ..., 0,d T is identified only up to a constant factor. Typically, one requires that 0,1, ..., 0,d is nonzero. One could assume without loss of generality that 0, , and the candidate 0 would then belong to the upper unit hemisphere Sd 1 n 1, ..., d Pd 2 , . For a fixed 1, ..., d T , denote X XT , X , , 1 i n.

To ensure a reliable energy determination, the light signal needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects, which not only attenuate the signal, but also produce a non negligible background component due to scattered Cherenkov light and multiple scattered light. The correction requires regular measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosol phase function, defined as the probability of light scattered in a given direction. At the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malarg ue, Argentina, the phase function is measured on an hourly basis using two Aerosol Phase Function APF light sources. These sources direct a UV light beam across the field of view of the fluorescence detectors the phase function can be extracted from the image of the shots in the fluorescence detector cameras. This paper describes the design, current status, standard operation procedure, and performance of the APF system at the Pierre Auger Observatory. Key words Ultra high energy cosmic rays air fluorescence detectors atmospheric monitoring aerosol phase function PACS 42.68. w, 42.68.Jg, 92.60.Mt, 92.60.Sz, 96.50.sd 1 Introduction The Pierre Auger Observatory in Malarg ue, Argentina, is designed to study the origin of ultra high energy cosmic rays with energies above 1018 eV. While Preprint submitted to Astroparticle Physics 16 February 2013 still under construction, scientific data taking began in 2004, and first results have been published . The Pierre Auger Observatory is a hybrid detector that combines two tech niques traditionally used to measure cosmic ray air showers surface particle detection and air fluorescence detection. Both detector types measure the cos mic ray primary indirectly, using the Earth s atmosphere as part of the de tector medium. When the primary particle enters the atmosphere, it interacts with air molecules, initiating a cascade of secondary particles, the so called ex tensive air shower. Surface detectors in the form of ground arrays sample the shower front as it impacts the ground, whereas air fluorescence detectors make use of the fact that the particles in the air shower excite nitrogen molecules in the air, causing UV fluorescence. Using photomultiplier cameras to record air shower UV emission, we can observe showers as they develop through the atmosphere and obtain a nearly calorimetric estimate of the shower energy. Upon completion, the surface detector SD array of the Pierre Auger Ob servatory will comprise 1600 water Cherenkov detector tanks, deployed in a hexagonal grid over an area of 3000 km2, and four fluorescence detector FD stations overlooking the SD from the periphery. An advantage of combining both detector types at the same site is the possibility to cross calibrate. Based on the subset of events seen with both detectors, the nearly calorimetric in formation of the FD provides the energy calibration of the SD. For the calibration to be meaningful, the properties of the calorimeter, i.e. the atmosphere, must be well known. At the Pierre Auger Observatory, this is achieved by an extensive program to monitor the atmosphere within the overall FD aperture and measure atmospheric attenuation and scattering properties in the 300 to 400 nm wavelength band recorded by the FD cameras. One of the key atmospheric parameters required for a reliable energy determination in air fluorescence detectors is the aerosol phase function. The phase function is defined as the probability of scattering light in a given direction and is therefore crucial for the interpretation of the light collected by the FD cameras. In this paper, we describe the design, construction, and performance of the aerosol phase function system developed at the Pierre Auger Observatory to measure the phase function on an hourly basis, which is necessary to ensure the precision of the energy determination.

Chunk: 0.60 0.03 for dry conditions and 0.65 0.05 for ambient conditions. The aerosol phase function most commonly used in fluorescence detector data analysis, both for the High Resolution Fly s Eye HiRes Experiment , which operated in Utah between 1997 and 2006, and the Pierre Auger FD de tectors, is the function obtained from a desert aerosol simulation by Longtin . Longtin s desert model is based on Mie scattering theory and assumes that the desert atmosphere has three major components carbonaceous particles, water soluble particles, and sand. For each aerosol component, the model assumes a characteristic log normal size distribution and refractive index. Longtin per formed his calculations for several wavelengths and wind speeds those made at 550 nm with a wind speed of 10 m s most closely match the 300 nm to 400 nm nitrogen fluorescence band observed by the FDs and have therefore been traditionally used in air fluorescence data analysis. 14 scattering angle 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 1 phase function sr 2 10 1 10 1 Aerosol Phase , Longtin This work .5, .7 This work .4, .6 Fig. 9.

The comparison shows that, on average, the differ ence between the Longtin function and the measured phase function is small for those scattering angles relevant in fluorescence measurements 30 to 150 . Only at the largest scattering angles above 160 do the phase func tions differ notably. This region is outside the current range of validity of our measurement. Our primary interest in aerosol scattering is its effect on the air shower recon struction, most notably the determination of the shower energy. However, it is not straightforward to estimate the extent to which the use of measured rather than averaged values of f and g changes the energy reconstruction, as this depends strongly on other atmospheric parameters, for example the aerosol optical depth. Rather than singling out the phase function measurement, we need to study the effect of the combined measurement of all atmospheric pa rameters, a task which is beyond the scope of this paper. We can, however, get an estimate of the relevance of the phase function mea surement by studying its effect on the energies of events that are of particu lar importance for the energy calibration of the detector, the golden hybrid 15 hist1 Mean 0.6996 RMS 0.7913 std E apf E std E 10 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 10 number 1 10 2 10 hist1 Mean 0.6996 RMS 0.7913 , .71 RMS 0.79 , .87 RMS 2.34 Weather Conditions , 0, . 10.

The blue histogram represents events taken during nights with measurable aerosols and the red histogram represents events taken during purely molecular nights. The observed differences between the two reconstructions are consistent with the expected changes in the phase function parameters. The largest differences are observed for the highest energy events, with differences of up to 10% in energy. For the majority of events, however, the differences are much smaller, typically less than 2%.

Chunk: measurements. In both cases atmospheric extinction was simu lated using an average aerosol profile model representative of the Malarg ue site . Fig. 10 depicts the relative differences in energies caused by reconstructing showers with the default phase function and the measured phase function. The red bold histogram represents data taken during nights with aerosol contamination , while the blue light histogram represents data taken during nights where according to the APF analysis scattering is purely molecular. The correction is typically of order one percent. However, on those nights when aerosol loading is extremely low, so that atmospheric scattering may be characterized as purely molecular, the use of the default scattering parameters causes larger errors in the shower reconstruction. Under such conditions, the total phase function lacks the strong forward scattering component typical of aerosols. During these periods, incorrectly accounting for aerosol scattering starts to impact the energy calibration of the detector. A correct determination of the phase function on a regular basis is therefore an important part of the atmospheric monitoring efforts at the site. 16 5 Conclusions and Outlook As part of the atmospheric monitoring program at the Pierre Auger Obser vatory, the aerosol phase function at 350 nm is routinely measured at two of the four FD sites. A first analysis of data taken from June to December 2006 shows that values of .6 for the mean cosine of the scattering angle are typical for aerosols at the site of the experiment. Over the next several years, the APF light sources will produce a data set of unprecedented size of the scattering properties of aerosols. This data set will enable us to carefully study any seasonal change in the aerosol content. The APF light sources and the other atmospheric monitoring instruments at the Auger site will accumulate one of the largest sets of continuous measurements in the 300 nm to 400 nm range ever recorded for a single location. The APF light sources are currently operating at a wavelength of 350 nm only. In the near future, we will add regular measurements at 330 nm and 390 nm to study the dependence of the phase function on the wavelength of the scattered light. Acknowledgements We are grateful to the following agencies and organizations for financial sup port The APF light sources were built by a grant from the Department of Energy DOE Office of Science USA DE FG03 92ER40732 . Parts of the APF analysis were performed during the 2006 REU Research Experience for Undergraduates program at Columbia University s Nevis Laboratories which is supported by the National Science Foundation USA under contract num ber NSF PHY 0452277.

Chunk: information, its transformation will produce by simple drift increases in the complexity of information, without any goal or purpose. This occurs simply because there is an open niche for information to become more complex as it varies. But this also promotes agents to become more complex to exploit novel complex information and propagate it. Evolution does not need to favour complexity in any way information just propagates to every possible niche as fast as possible, and it seems that there is often an adjacent possible niche of greater complexity. For example, it can be said that a protein as an agent perceives some information via its binding sites, as it recognizes molecules that fit a site. More complex molecules will certainly need more complex binding sites. Whether complex molecules are better or worse is a different matter some will be better, some will be worse. But for those which are better, the complexity of the proteins must match the complexity of the molecules perceived. If the binding site perceives only a part of the molecule, then this might be confused with other molecules which share the perceived part. Following the law of information transformation, there will be a variety of complexities of information. The law of requisite complexity just states that the increase in complexity of information is determined by the ability of agents to perceive, act on, and propagate more complex information. Since more complex information will be able to produce more variety, the speed of the complexity increase will escalate together with the complexity of the information. 4.4 Law of Information Criticality Transforming and propagating information will tend to a critical balance be tween its stability and its variability. Propagating information maintains itself as much as possible, but transforming information varies it as much as possi ble. This struggle leads to a critical balance analogous to the edge of chaos , self organized criticality , and the complexity from noise princi ple . The homeostasis of living systems can also be seen as the self regulation of information criticality. This law can generalize Kauffman s four candidate laws for the coconstruc tion of a biosphere 32, Ch. 8 . Their relationship with this framework demands further discussion, which is out of the scope of this paper. A well known example can be seen with cellular automata and random Boolean networks stable ordered dynamics limit considerably or do not allow change of states so information cannot propagate, while variable chaotic dynamics change the states too much, losing information. Following the law of information propagation, information will tend to a critical state between stability and variability to maximize its propagation if it is too stable, it will not propagate, and if it is too variable, it will be transformed. In other words, critical information will be able to propagate better than stable or variable one, i.e. as fast as possible cf. law of information propagation . 4.5 Law of Information Organization Information produces constraints that regulate information production. These constraints can be seen as organization . In other words, evolving information will be organized by transformation and propagation to regulate information production. According to the law of information criticality, this organization will lie at a critical area between stability and variability. And following the law of information propagation, the organization of information will enable it to propagate as fast as possible. This law can also be seen as information having a certain control over its environment, since the organization of information will help it withstand pertur bations. It has been shown that using this idea as a fitness function can lead to the evolution of robust and adaptive agents, namely maximizing the mutual information between sensors and environment. A clear example of information producing its own organization can be seen with living systems, which are discussed in Section 5. 4.6 Law of Information Self organization Information tends to its preferred,

Chunk: bundles do not coalesce, the average retardance goes as t n t L t L0 , where n t is the number of MTs in the cross section of a bundle and is the retardance of a single MT. Therefore, the linear relation between t and L t L0 implies that n t remains constant throughout buck ling. Thus, the elongation of MT bundles occurs through the polymerization of MTs within the bundles and does not in volve the incorporation of new MTs to existing bundles. With the above observations and model, we can quanti tatively characterize the elastic properties of the bundle K and network . We begin with the implications of the mea sured wavelength . In order to predict from the mechani cal buckling model, we need to estimate K and F Eq. . Two limits exist for K. If tight packing solid model of the MTs inside the bundle is assumed, then , where KMT 3.4 10 23 N m2 is the bending rigidity of a single MT . If MTs slide freely inside the bun dle, then . We employ the measured force velocity relation, f v C1 ln C2 v C3 .89 pN, .13 m min and .08 m min , for a sin gle MT and presume v , where v is the average elongation rate of individual MT inside the bundle. Writ ing the average length of MTs inside the bundle as lMT, the elongation rate of a single MT is then approximately v lMT lMT L t L0. Using the models for K, F and Eq. , we derive predictions of for both the solid model, p 8nKMT f v lMT , and the slip model, p 8KMT f v lMT . Each depends on lMT and n. Using , we plot the wavelength over a reasonable range of individual MT lengths in Fig. 4. The solid model for K appears much more reasonable than the slip model. The fact that K depends quadratically on n in our system suggests that MTs are fully coupled acting like a solid material inside the bundle, similar to the behavior of F actin bundles held to gether through depletion forces . The bundling of initially aligned MTs can be attributed to the depletion force induced by unpolymerized tubulin dimers, oligomers and even short MTs . The conclusion that the bundles bend as solid rods appar ently conflicts with the picture of elongation, that involves the growth and relative sliding of individual MTs within the bun dles. We speculate that the explanation involves two distinct time scales the time for a MT to come to mechanical equi librium with its neighbors following the insertion of a tubulin dimer to its end, mech, and the average interval between in sertions, dimer. In the limit dimer, strong coupling be tween the MTs in the bundle can occur leading to the solid rod result. The opposite limit intuitively leads to weak coupling between the MTs within a bundle. We estimate dimer 0.1s from our data, which seems quite long compared to the times characterizing the relative motion of neighboring MTs on the molecular length scales relevant to mech. The exact molecu lar picture, which goes beyond the scope of our model, needs further study. Using the solid model for K, we can calculate the remain ing model parameter, , from Eq. Kslip 2 expt 4 0.032Pa. This value is remarkably small compared to that estimated for a single MT buckling inside a cell 2700Pa . We identify two contributors to the difference between and .

In the solid model p 8nKMT f v lMT , and in the slip model p 8KMT f v lMT . expt is the experimentally observed buckling wavelength dashed line . ration . In summary, using microscopic studies of the temporal evo lution of the striated MT patterns, we show that the polymer ization of MTs within the bundles causes uniform elongation. This in turn creates the driving compressional force which ultimately causes the MT bundles to buckle. It is this coor dinated buckling that produces the striped birefringent pat tern. The proposed mechanical buckling model adequately describes the buckling process. It predicts a critical buckling force and a characteristic wavelength, which depend on the elasticity of the surrounding network and the bending rigid ity of the MT bundles. Combing the bending rigidity of MT bundles and the established MT force velocity curve with the mechanical model, we obtain a reasonable estimate for the elastic constant of the network and find that MTs inside the bundle are fully coupled.

We used the upper limit for the rate in that peak as the average as we considered this to be most conservative. o .15 0.93e E 148 766 , where E is the ray energy in keV. This expression is normalized to 1.0 at 209 keV and is estimated to have an accuracy of about 20 near 200 keV improving to about 10 at 2600 keV. The quoted relative efficiency for each of the 4 individual CLOVER detectors is 26 at 1.33 MeV as quoted by the manufacturer. Table III does not incorporate this efficiency correction, therefore the table presents the measured count rates with a minimum of assumptions. The thickness of Pb is large compared to the mean free path of the rays of interest, therefore, the scaling should hold for other thick shield configurations. Even so, the rates will be geometry dependent so these results can only be considered guides when applied to other experimental designs. The rate of these excitations also depends on neutron energy. For the background run AmBe run the average neutron energy is 6.5 MeV 5.5 MeV . Our simulations predict that the rate of these excitations scales as energy to the 0.81 power. V. DISCUSSION A. A Model of the CLOVER Background We can use these experimental results to create a back ground model for our surface lab and deduce the contri bution to the continuum near 2039 keV due to n,n re actions. We then use simulation of high energy neutron production and propagation to extrapolate this model to better understand experiments done at depth. The measured rate for the continuum near 2039 keV was 14.8 events keV kg d . For the Th wire data, this continuum rate was 0.10 events keV s 2900 events keV kg d and for the AmBe data it was 0.09 events keV s 2600 events keV kg d . To determine the neutron induced continuum rates in the AmBe data, however, we have to correct for the contribution from the tail of two high energy rays that are not part of the neutron induced spectrum in the background. These are the rays from the 2223 keV p n, d and the 4.4 MeV rays originat ing from the ,n reaction of the AmBe source itself. Although only 10 of these AmBe rays penetrate the 5 cm Pb shield, there is still a significant flux. A single correction for the background continuum is 1.7 events keV s 2000 events keV kg d . Subtracting this correction from the measured rate of 13.9 events keV kg d for the AmBe data gives 12.2 events keV kg d as the total neutron induced continuum rate in the AmBe data. B. Extrapolations to Other Shield Geometries The continuum rate from the CLOVER detector scales as the square of the shield thickness, T. This scaling law can be used to extrapolate our results to other shield geometries. However, the uncertainty of 35 associated with the extrapolation is significant. This is due to the use of the simplifying assumption that the Pb shield thicknesses are large compared to the mean free path of the rays of interest. If the shield thickness is comparable to the mean free path this assumption does not hold and the scaling law becomes less reliable. To estimate the uncertainty of the extrapolation, one can use the following formula: uncertainty = (0.31) n (1-Tn)/Tn where n is the total number of data points, and Tn is the total

Chunk: determine an absolute rate in the continuum because the high energy threshold prevented the observation of the full energy peak or its escape peaks. The simulation pre dicts 0.03 events keV s . Subtracting these two contri butions from the continuum rate for the AmBe source near 2039 keV results in a final value of 0.03 events keV s or 860 events keV kg d . Our background measurements were done without a cosmic ray anti coincidence system. From auxiliary mea surements with a scintillator in coincidence with the CLOVER and a similar shielding geometry, we measured the rate of passing through the detector. In the contin uum near the 2039 keV region, the rate is 5.4 events keV kg d . From the Th wire source data, we measure the ratio 13 TABLE IV A summary of the count rate in the CLOVER background data in the energy region near 2039 keV based on the model deduced for the surface lab described in the text. The precision of the neutron induced and muon induced spectra simulations Section II C and Ref is estimated to be about 35 . We take this to be a conservative estimate for the uncertainties associated with this Table. Process CLOVER Event Rate Surface Lab events keV kg d neutron induced 8.3 2.9 208Tl Compton scattering 0.7 0.3 high energy continuum 5.4 1.9 Total from model 14.4 5.0 Measured Rate 14.8 0.2 of the rate in the continuum near 2039 keV to that in the 2614 keV 16.3 Hz peak to be 6 10 3 keV. Of the 2614 keV peak rate in the background data, 33 is due to 208Tl decay. Scaling from the 2614 keV peak in the background data, the count rate near the 2039 keV region due to the Compton tail of the 208Tl 2614 keV peak is 0.7 events keV kg d . The remainder of the 2614 keV peak is due to neutron induced processes. The contribution due to neutrons can be estimated from the AmBe data. For the AmBe data, the ratio of the rate in the continuum near the 2039 keV region 0.03 events keV s to that for the 596 keV 74Ge n, n peak 1.87 Hz is 1.6 10 2 keV. Scaling from the 74Ge peak rate in the background data 59.9 h indicates a rate of 7.8 events keV kg d in the contin uum near 2039 keV. That is, 53 of the events in that region are due to neutrons. One can do a similar scal ing from the 692 keV 72Ge rates. Here the ratio is 1.3 10 2 keV and the continuum rate is 8.8 events keV kg d . We use the average of the Ge values as our estimate 8.3 events keV kg d 3030 events keV kg y for the neutron induced contribution to the continuum rate. Table IV summarizes the deduced contributions to the spectrum in the 2039 keV region in the CLOVER back ground spectrum and the following section discusses how these data are used along with simulation to estimate rates in experimental apparatus underground. B. Solving the Problem with Overburden The primary purpose of this study is to better under stand the impact of neutrons on the background for fu ture double beta decay experiments. In this subsection, we use neutron fluxes from our simulations of the surface laboratory, measurements with the AmBe source, and simulations of the neutron flux in an underground lab oratory to estimate the contribution of neutron induced backgrounds underground. In the following subsection, we examine data from previous underground experi ments. The simulation of neutron processes in the 10 cm Pb shield and Ge comprising the CLOVER detector at the altitude of our laboratory predicts about 1594 558 events keV kg y between 2000 and 2100 keV due to lead excitation and 289 101 events keV kg y between 2000 and 2100 keV due to Ge excitation. This corresponds to a total of 1883 568 events keV kg y. The simulated background rate is dominated by the high energy continuum and the 208Tl Compton tail. The rate for the 2614 keV 208Tl peak is estimated to be 16.3 Hz, the rate for the 2039 keV region due to the Compton tail is estimated to be 0.7 events keV kg d, and the rate in the continuum near 2039 keV due to the high energy continuum is estimated to be 5.4 events keV kg d. The total of the rate in the continuum near 2039 keV from the model is 14.4 events keV kg d. The ratio of the rate in the continuum near the 2039 keV region to that in the 2614 keV peak to be 6 10 3 keV.

Chunk: an event had 2 crystals that responded in coincidence, the histogram would have two entries. Therefore the spectra we analyzed and simulated included all single crystal en ergy deposits. By not eliminating events that registered signals in more than 1 of the CLOVER Ge detectors, we maximized the event rate. The peak strengths were estimated by fitting a Gaussian shape to peaks and a flat background to the spectrum in the region near the peak. For the nuclear recoil lines, the peak shape was assumed to be a triangle and not Gaussian. In Table I the uncertainties derive from this fit. A summary of the peak strengths is given in Table I and the spectra them selves are shown in Fig. 2. The data sets were chosen to help decouple line blendings. Because the rates in all peaks and continua are much higher for the source induced data than for the background, features in those spectra are due to the sources and other contributions can be safely ignored. For example, the 2614.5 keV line can arise from either the decay of 208Tl or 208Pb n, n . When exposed to a Th source, Tl decay dominates the spectrum, whereas when exposed to an AmBe source, n, n dominates. Hence by normalizing the rate in this line to the rate in a pure neutron induced transition e.g. the 596 keV 74Ge n,n , we can determine the relative contribution of the two processes to the back ground spectrum. In fact, in the background data, both processes contribute to this line. Some comments on our choices for line identification are in order. For an isotope such as 72Ge where a neutron capture leads to a stable nucleus, almost all n, lines could also be interpreted as n, n lines in the result ing nucleus in this case 73Ge. For isotopes within the detector however, such as the 53.5 keV 72Ge n, tran sition, the competing 73Ge n, n line would be a sum of this ray energy and the recoil nucleus energy. At these low energies where the recoil is a fair fraction of the ray energy, the n, n would simply contribute to the continuum and not be observed as a line. For the high energy cases, the blend of a mono energetic ray line and a n, n process might be present. For the calibration runs, our threshold was approxi mately 70 keV. Also note that we used a thorium wire as a calibration source. Since the wire is pure natural Th, we observe the Th X rays in that data. In contrast, the background run shows lines from the thorium chain as a contaminant, therefore those lines are absent. In all spectra, there are a few lines we have not iden tified.

Chunk: Sco, however, and indeed than any of the systems considered here. Because of its much larger semimajor axis, and to some extent its circular orbit, GW Ori is much more likely to have significant circumstellar disks, as the stars do not approach each other very closely at periastron. Thus, material flowing from the circumbinary disk may merge with the circumstellar disks and then accrete more gradually onto the stars, rather than falling directly on or near the stellar surfaces as is expected to happen in the shorter period systems. If the infalling material does not shock strongly as it merges with the circumstellar disk, and if any density enhancements are smoothed out somewhat by the time the material reaches the stellar surface, then any photometric signature of the periodic infall would be weakened. We note that UZ Tau E likely has circumstellar disks as well Jensen et al. 1996a , so a similar effect could be at work in reducing the amplitude of the periodic variability relative to the stochastic variability. 5.3.4. V4046 Sgr Like GW Ori, V4046 Sgr has a nearly circular orbit. However, V4046 Sgr has shown periodic photometric variations at the binary orbital period Quast et al. 2000 Mekkaden 2000 . These variations persist over several years and are relatively sinusoidal Walter, unpublished data, 2003 2005 . Unlike the other binaries discussed here, in this case stellar rotation is a plausible explanation of the observed variations. It is common for stellar rotational periods to become synchronized with the binary orbital period, particularly for short period binaries like V4046 Sgr. Given the short period resulting in stronger tidal 16 interactions and a shorter synchronization time scale and the somewhat older age of this system 10 Myr , synchronization is plausible, and indeed is supported by detailed analysis of the system Stempels Gahm 2004 . However, rotation does not explain the periodic Balmer line variations observed, which Stempels Gahm attribute to accumulations of gas co rotating with the binary orbit. 5.3.5. ROXs 42 and ROXs 43B These two spectroscopic binaries are both weak lined T Tauri stars Bouvier Appenzeller 1992 Walter et al. 1994 , indicating less active accretion than some of the other systems dis cussed here. Neither has been detected at millimeter wavelengths, yielding only an upper limit on the disk masses Skinner et al. 1991 Jensen et al. 1996b . Both systems show mid infrared excesses, indicating the presence of circumbinary material, and a lack of near infrared excess, which can be modeled as a cleared central region in the disk Jensen Mathieu 1997 . The fact that both are higher order multiple systems complicates matters ROXs 42 NTTS 162814 2427 is a triple system with a separation of 0. 15 Lee 1992 Ghez et al. 1993 , while ROXs 43B NTTS 162819 2423S has a wide companion at 4. 8 which is itself a close binary system Walter et al. 1994 Simon et al. 1995b . Since the evidence for the pres ence of a substantial disk rests on the low spatial resolution IRAS detections, it is possible that the excess is associated with the wider companions rather than arising from circumbi nary disks around the spectroscopic binaries. In any case, the lack of millimeter detections indicates that there is less disk mass in these two systems than in the others discussed here. Neither system has been intensively monitored over timespans that would be necessary to detect periodic photometric variations at the relatively long orbital periods. ROXs 42 shows evidence for some semi regular variations over roughly 1.5 orbital periods Zakirov et al. 1993 , while the combined light of the ROX 43 system shows only a 0.1 magnitude varia tion, with evidence of a 1.5 day or 3 day periodicity, presumably attributable to rotation of one or more of the components Jensen et al. 1996b . 5.3.6. UZ Tau The two components of this spectroscopic binary have different spectral types, the primary being A3Ve and the secondary K2Ve Quast et al. 2000 . The system is a well known X ray source, with an X ray luminosity that has varied by an order of magnitude over several years Walter et al. 1996 , and with a spectrum that is consistent with a heavily absorbed, moderately hard source. The X ray emission is likely associated with the accretion of gas from a circumstellar disk onto the stellar surfaces. Periodic photometric variations at the binary orbital period were discovered by Jensen et al. 1996a , but the amplitude of the variations is rather low for a system with a semi major axis of 36 au, suggesting that some of the infalling material may be accreting onto the circumstellar disks and then being gradually accreted onto the stars, as is suggested for GW Ori. There is also a weak line in the spectrum of the primary, suggesting that the accretion activity is relatively low

Chunk: UZ Tau E primary directly if three quantities are known the inclination irot of the star s rotation axis, the star s projected rotational velocity v sin irot, and the stellar radius. Of these, the inclination is typically impossible to measure, except under special circumstances. As noted in Section 3, the dynamical mass measurement of UZ Tau E allows us to determine the binary orbital inclination iorbit. Based on studies of other binary systems, it is reasonable to assume that this inclination is the same as that of the stellar rotation axis, irot. The most detailed study comparing the orientations of these axes in binary systems is that of Hale . Considering spectral types of F5 K5, he finds that binaries with separations less than 30 40 AU tend to exhibit co planarity between rotational equators and orbital planes, while wider binaries have random orientations. Using a similar method, Weis found a tendency for the stellar rotational equators to align with the binary orbit among primaries in F star binaries. Interestingly, Weis did not find a tendency toward co planarity between rotational and orbital planes among A stars, suggesting that caution is necessary when comparing stars of different masses. Similarly, Guthrie found no correlation between orbital inclination and v sin i among 23 A2 A9 binaries with semi major axes of 10 70 AU. The low mass and short period of UZ Tau E suggest, however, that the conclusions of Hale are most applicable here. Prato et al. find .63 0.19 0.17 L and 150 K for the primary in UZ Tau E. Combining these values yields .9 0.2 R . Hartmann Stauffer find v sin .9 4.0 km s 1 for UZ Tau E using optical spectra, consistent with the value v sin 2 km s 1, which we measure from our new spectra and adopt here. Since absorption lines of the secondary of UZ Tau E have only been seen in near infrared spectra and are not evident in any of our optical spectra, we take this to be the projected rotation velocity of the primary. Combining these measurements with sin .81 0.05 Section 3 , and assuming , we find .9 0.8 d. If iorbit irot, we find Prot 6 1 d since sin i 1. Thus, uncertainty on the inclination cannot reconcile the photometric period with the inferred rotation period. The most uncertain remaining quantity is v sin i, but since Hartmann Stauffer measured v sin i from 11 different spectra of UZ Tau E, with self consistent results from two different parts of the spectrum including spectra near 5200 A and consistency with our new v sin i measurement, it is unlikely that line broadening from photospheric lines of the faint, red secondary could lead to an overestimate of v sin i by a factor of four. Similarly, given the uncertainties on L and Teff, it is difficult to see how the radius could be underestimated by a factor of four. Thus, we conclude that the observed periodic variations are unlikely to 12 be due to stellar rotation. 5.2. Evidence for pulsed accretion We have shown above that UZ Tau E exhibits periodic photometric variations that have the same period as the binary orbit, and that these variations are unlikely to be caused by stellar rotation. Here, we examine the predictions made by the pulsed accretion model of AL96 and compare them to our observations. 5.2.1. What are the predictions? Broadly speaking, Artymowicz Lubow predict that a binary with an eccentric orbit and a circumbinary disk will have an accretion flow from the circumbinary disk, and thus onto the circumstellar disks or stellar surfaces, that varies periodically at the binary orbital period. The exact behavior of the accretion rate with orbital phase depends on the binary orbital parameters. AL96 show the results of two simulations, one for mass ratio M2 .43 and eccentricity .1, and

Chunk: another for M2 .79 and .5. The former shows accretion that varies relatively smoothly over the orbital period, while the latter is strongly peaked at periastron. As noted by AL96, the exact timing of the accretion variability depends on the orbital parameters, most strongly on e. Some previous observational studies of T Tauri spectroscopic binaries have focused specifically on looking for enhanced accretion near periastron however, we note here that the actual prediction of the model is more general than that, and that the peak accretion rate need not come near periastron. 5.2.2. How well do the data match the predictions? First, we note that our observations match the general predictions of AL96 quite well, in that there are indeed periodic photometric variations at the binary orbital period, which are readily interpretable as a variable accretion rate. The comparison with the spectroscopic data is more ambiguous if more intensive monitoring of the H line in UZ Tau E were to show that there are no orbit modulated H variations, it would present a problem for the model. For a more specific comparison with our data, Figure 9 shows the variations of accretion 13 with orbital phase predicted by AL96 for a binary with M2 .43, .1. UZ Tau E has a more extreme mass ratio M2 .30 and larger eccentricity .33 than this, but these parameters are closer to those of UZ Tau E than those of the other simulation in AL96. AL96 do note that the timing of the maxima of the accretion depend largely on e rather than M2 M1. Since e for UZ Tau E is intermediate between the two models calculated by AL96, we might then expect the maximum accretion to come between the phase of 0.75 they calculate for the low e case and the phase of 1 for the high e case. For comparison with our data, we have taken the logarithm of the variations of accretion rate predicted by AL96 to shift them onto a magnitude like scale, and added an arbitrary offset and scale factor to match the mean of the data and amplitude of the variations. The phase of the minimum predicted by this simulation does not match our data well when the model is given a shift of 0.2 in orbital phase, there is better agreement between the model predictions and the data. This scaling and shifting to match the data is obviously ad hoc, but it allows us to compare the phase width of the observed variations, which appear to match the predictions relatively well. In addition, this shifted position of the maximum is indeed between the two cases calculated by AL96, as expected if eccentricity is the dominant factor in determining the timing of maximum accretion. 5.3. Evidence for periodic accretion in other T Tauri binaries The discussion and data above show that looking for evidence of periodic accretion can be complicated, with other sources of variability perhaps being important and masking the effect in small datasets, and with the exact behavior expected to be a function of the specific binary orbital parameters. That said, is evidence for pulsed accretion seen in other young binary systems? In Table 4 we present characteristics of young binaries with periods of less than one year and evidence of circumbinary material, in order of increasing eccentricity. Below, we examine the observational data for some of these systems, attempting to relate them to what we see in UZ Tau and exploring similarities and differences. Unfortunately, the small number of systems and their somewhat heterogeneous properties means that it is difficult to generalize, so we offer these comments in the spirit of attempting to pull together the existing data, rather than arguing one way or the other for the validity of the AL96 model for the sample as a whole. 14 5.3.1.

Chunk: ki 2 M 1 P i 1 2 j2 i k2 i M 1 P i 1 2 ji ki 2 for practical evaluation on an observed network, where ji, ki are the degrees of the vertices at the ends of the ith edge, with , . . . , M . This formula gives when the corresponding network is positively negatively correlated, and . Recently, Maslov et al and Park et al have proposed a possible explanation for the origin of such correlation. They show for a network the restriction that there is at most one edge between any pair of nodes induces negative degree correlations. This restriction seems to be an universal mechanism indeed, there is no double edges in most real networks , therefore, the authors of Ref. conjecture that disassortativity by degree is the normal state of affairs for a network. Although only a part of the measured correlation can be explained in the way of Ref. , this universal mechanism does give a promising explanation for the origin of degree correlation observed in real networks of various types. It will be of great interest to discuss the effect of node deleting on degree correlation. In Fig. 3, we give the assortativity coefficient r as a function of network size N, for different Pa in our model, for . As one sees from Fig. 3, for each value of Pa, after a transitory period with finite size effect, each r of networks tends to reach a steady value. When , r 0 as N becomes large. This result indicates that networks in the BA model are uncorrelated, in agreement with results obtained in previous studies . When , nontrivial negative degree correlations spontaneously develop as networks evolve. One can see from Fig. 3 that the steady value of r in the model decreases with the decreasing Pa. In particular, when Pa 0.6, the value of r is about 0.1. These results indicate that node deleting leads to disassortative mixing by degree in evolving networks. To make such relation more clear, in Fig. 4, we plot r of networks in our model as a function of Pa, for different m. As the Fig. 3 indicates, when the network size is larger than 40000, the assortativity coefficient r is nearly stable. So all results in Fig. 4 are obtained from networks with . Fig. 4 gives us the same relation between r and Pa shown in Fig. 3. What is more, it tells us that for a given Pa, r will increase with the increasing m.

We point out that this is because when , the network has been broke up into small separate components see the following section . We can also find from Fig. 4 that the gap between different curves decreases with the increasing m and the curves tend to merge at large m. Now we give some explanations to the above observations. In the BA model, the network being uncorrelated is the result of a competition between two factors the growth and the preferential attachment PA . On the one hand, networks with pure growth is positively correlated. This is because the older nodes, also tending to be higher

Chunk: degree ones, have a higher probability of being connected to one another, since they coexisted earlier. In Fig. 5, we compute the assortativity coefficient r of a randomly growing network, which grows by the growth rule of BA type, while the newly added nodes connect to randomly chosen existing ones. As one can see from Fig. 5 that pure growth leads to positive r. On the other hand, the introduction of PA makes the connection between nodes tend to be negatively correlated, since newly added nodes usually low degree ones prefer to connect to highly connected ones. Then degree correlation characteristic of the BA model is determined by this two factors. In Fig. 6, we plot the average degree of the nearest nn as a function of k in the BA model. It is found that nodes with large k show no obvious biases in their connections. But there is a short disassortative mixing region when k is relatively small also reported in Ref. , see Fig.1a therein . Such phenomenon can be explained by the effect of these two factor 8 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 k FIG. 6 Average degree of the nearest neighbor as a function of k for the BA model.

Inset gives the same curve for . In the simulations, . All results are based on 10 independent realizations. Growth together with PA makes nodes with large k equally connect to both large and small degree nodes, and the latter makes nodes with small degree be disassortatively connected. Now, we introduce node deletion. According to Eq. , depression of the growth of large degree nodes also decreases the connections between them, therefore makes the correlation negative. We also investigate the effect of node deleting on the r of the randomly growing network, and obtained similar results. As one sees from Fig. 5, depression of connections between higher degree nodes causes the network less positively correlated, and with stronger node deletion, negatively correlated. Finally, with regard to the effect of m in this relation Fig. 4 , larger m means more edges are established according to the PA probability Eq. . We conjecture that the orderliness of newly added nodes connecting to large degree nodes will be weakened by the increasing randomness as m becomes larger, thus leading to a less negative correlation. Such randomness can not always increase and, as we see from Fig. 4, for large m, e.g., m 14, the curves tend to merge together. 9 V. SIZE OF GIANT COMPONENT In a network, a set of connected nodes forms a component. If the relative size of the largest component S in a network approaches a nonzero value when the network is grown to infinite size, this component is called the giant component of the network . In most previously studied growing models , due to the BA type growth rule they adopted, there is only one huge component in the network, i.e., S 1. In this extreme case the network gains a perfect connectedness. The opposite case of 0, in which case the network, made up of small components, exhibits no connectedness. Experiments indicate that some real networks seem to lie in somewhere between these two extreme they contain a giant component as well as many separate components . For example, According to Ref. , in May of 1999, the entire WWW, containing 203 106 pages, consisted of a giant component of 186 106 pages and the

Chunk: algorithms need to calculate the n time o n3 . Thus the complexity is O n4 . Since the non isomorphism perfect matching comes from the coding of edges in the component of G, it is not easy implementation. 7 Let us give two recursive equation to obtain a perfect matching M from G. Suppose there are k component G1, G2, . . . Gk in G where Gi is a component with degree 2 and Ei 3. M M t Gt, Gt is a cycle M t , otherwise. M t 1 M , if r F 1 M r F 1 M t M t , otherwise. where t k 1, when , M is the initial perfect matching from G. When r F 1 M t n 1, According the theorem 1, the M t is a Hamiltonian cycle solution. If all of r F 1 M t n 1, then there has no Hamiltonian cycle in D. Since the non isomorphism perfect matching M in G is poset, the function r F 1 M in G is monotonic, so this approach is exactly approach. Let us give a example to illustrate the approach in detail. Example 1. Considering the digraph D in figure 1, then the projector graph G in figure 2. Let . Thus the r F 1 M n 3. Let M r F 1 M G3 ,then r F 1 M n 4, thus ,G1. At last it obtain the solution. Considering the equation 11, let it substituted by following equations when r M n 1 and . M t 1 M if r F 1 M r F 1 M t It is obvious that all non isomorphism Hamiltonian cycle could obtain by the repeat check the equation 12 and the equation r M n 1. In conversely, if a Hamiltonian cycle of digraphs is given, it represents a perfect matching M in its projector graph G. Thus the equation 12 and Theo rem 3 follows a corollary. Corollary 3. Given a Hamiltonian digraph, the complexity of determining another non isomorphism Hamiltonian cycle is polynomial time. 5.2 The HCP in digraph with bound two Let us extend the Theorem 3 to digraphs with d v 2 and d v 2 in this section. Theorem 6. The complexity of finding a Hamiltonian cycle existing or not in digraphs with degree d v 2 and d v 2 is polynomial time. 8 Proof. Suppose a digraph D V, A having a vertex vi is shown as figure 3, which is d vi 2 d vi 2 Figure 3. A vertex with degree than 2 HHHHH H j m a1 a2 HHHHH H j a3 a4 Let us spilt this vertex to two vertices that one of vertex has degree with in degree 2 or out degree 1 , another vertex has degree with in degree 1 or out degree 2 as shown in figure 4. Then the D is derived to a new graph S. Figrue 4 A vertex in D is mapping to a vertex in digraph h a1 a2 a3 h a4 It is obvious that each vertex in the graph S has increase 1 vertices and 1 arcs of D. Suppose the worst cases is each vertex in D has in degree 2 and out degree 2, the total vertices in S has 2n vertices. According to the theorem 3, obtain a Hailtonian cycle L in S is no more then O n4 , then the D will has a Hamiltonian cycle L L A. 6 Discussion P versus NP The P versus NP is a famous open problem in computer science and math ematics, which means to determine whether very language accepted by some nondeterministic algorithm in polynomial time is also accepted by some deter ministic algorithm in polynomial time . Cook give a proposition for the P versus NP.

The asteroid plots the values of the critical fields. The intersections of these two sets of curves, indicated by solid symbols, are the fields at which switching occurs in the simulations. Moment switching in nanotube magnetic force probes 7 asteroid at large values of the tip has already switched to the low energy configuration. For numerical work the medium was assumed to be composed of a collection of individual dipole moments z, where Mmv, with Mm the saturation magnetization and v the volume of the individual medium elements. In what follows we take both the tip and medium volume elements to be cubes 4 nm on a side. This results in agreement to within a few percent between our numerical work and analytical expressions for the medium magnetic fields. Halving the size of the volume elements to cubes 2 nm on a side changes the calculated force derivative curve for see Figure 2c by about 2 . To model the dynamics of the tip flip process, we conceptually divide the tip into two domains, one with length L1 close to the medium, the other with length L L1 further away. Each has sufficiently strong exchange fields that the entire volume within each domain has the same moment orientation . The section of the tip furthest from the medium is assumed to have its moment parallel to the z axis that closest to the medium has its moment at an angle relative to the z axis Figure 1 . Then the energy of the tip in an external magnetic field can be written as E 0w2L1K1 w 0L1K1 1 2 1 cos sin2 Mt K1 where we have taken the simplest non trivial forms for the domain wall energy first term and the anisotropy energy second term . The third term in Eq. 9 is the energy of the dipole moments of the tip in the external magnetic field. Here 0K1 is the anisotropy energy density, w is the domain wall energy per unit area, Mt is the tip saturation magnetization, are the magnetic fields in the z and x directions respectively averaged over the tip volume from z0 L1. To simulate the magnetic force images, the tip moment is at first assumed to be parallel to the z axis. The tip is moved to a new position, the local fields are calculated and averaged over the tip volume, is moved to the new local minimum in energy Eq. 9 , the force gradient is calculated, and the process is repeated. This modeling results in the cross sections displayed in Figure 2 c,f , which reproduce the absence of tip switching at high bit densities and high lift heights, and the presence of tip switching at low bit densities and low lift heights. When tip switching occurs, the modeling also reproduces the fact that the tip sample force gradient always stays negative, with the tip moment reversing as the z component of the field crosses zero. The quantitative interpretation of MFM images in the presence of tip switching is straightforward once it is recognized that the phase shift is proportional to the negative of the absolute value of the tip sample force gradient dFz dz0 . The experimental phase shift oscillation amplitudes decrease much more rapidly than the modeling for bit densities above about 500 kfci Figure 2f . We believe that this is because the as written bits do not have as abrupt moment orientation reversals as our idealized model. Our modeling indicates Moment switching in nanotube magnetic force probes 8 that nanotube tips with the geometry of Figure 1 could be used to image bits with sharp moment direction transitions with densities above

Figure 4 compares the maximum minus the minimum value for along a cross section through the center of the bits at a bit density of 300 kfci as a function of tip height z0. The modeling results in this Figure are labeled by the length L1 of tip that is allowed to reorient its magnetic moment. There are three parameters in this analysis a global multiplicative factor, MtMm K1, and the reduced domain wall energy w 0L1K1. Figure 4b plots the best fit values for MtMm K1 and experimental model 2 N 1 N the number of data points . In all cases the best fit value for w 0L1K1 is 0, and the 2 value at w w . Increasing the domain wall energy requires larger switching fields the best fit value at .8 to 28.6 when w 0L1K1 increases from 0 to 1. The domain wall energy for Co is reported to be 3J m2 . This leads to w .85, using 0.25 M2 t neglecting crystalline anisotropy , with .4 106A m, so that our fits are consistent with the calculated wall energy, if one allows for a doubling of the best 2 value. The tip end may be magnetically poorly coupled to the rest of the tip because of an inhomogeneity or grain boundary it appears Figure 1 inset to have granularity on the scale of a few tens of nm and a kink about 50 nm from its end. We have observed qualitatively similar spatial frequency doubling using several nanotube tips, particularly in the smallest diameter tips, where inhomogeneities and weak magnetic coupling are fundamentally more difficult to avoid. The shift in the resonance frequency 0 of the cantilever due to a force gradient between the tip and sample dFz dz0 is given by dFz dz0 2k, where k is the spring constant of the cantilever. The phase shift of the cantilever response is then given by tan 1 Q 1 0 0 , where Q is the quality factor, is the driving frequency and 0 is the perturbed resonance frequency of the cantilever. At dF dz 0MtMm 2 10 9m. Using a driving frequency at optimal sensitivity 0 1 1 8Q , .8N m, , , and estimating .4 106A m and 105A m , this corresponds to an excursion in the phase shift 0.7o, in reasonable agreement with the experimental value of 0.4o given the uncertainties in the values for the saturation magnetizations. Using Mt , the best fit value MtMm K1 17 Figure 4 implies a critical field of approximately 2.4 104 A m, much smaller than the saturation magnetization of cobalt of 1.4 106 A m, but comparable to a switching field of 3.2 104 A m reported for 30 nm thick, 0.34 m wide, 2.04 m long ellipsoidal amorphous cobalt nanodots .

Chunk: tests described in Section 3 addressed the effects of numerical parameters 1. There are also two other potential sources of error, the limited volume of the simulation box and the error sam pling error in calculating the power spectrum of the simula tion snapshots. Care must be take that these effects are not causing spurious results. Figure 7 shows the results for the . For clar ity these have been omitted from the other plots, however the errors are similar in all cases. From this plot the deviation between models is roughly 1 Changing particle resolution did cause a slight systematic shift in features seen in the power spectrum ratios. The onset of the dispersion between the models seen in figures 4 6 at k 1hMpc 1 shifted to lower k with reduced particle resolution and higher k with an increase. This shift was of order 0.1 in log k for factors of two differences in particle resolution. We cannot fully account for this numerical effect, however the difference in power at a given k mode due to the shift is at most 0.1 and since subpercent effects are beyond the ability of N body simulations to probe ac curately, we do not believe this effect is of significant consequence. Figure 7. As Fig. 4, with rms sampling errors included, shown by thin lines of the same line style as each model. Figure 8. The effect on the power spectrum due to different real isations. Displayed are the power in three realisations of a single cosmological model, , as a ratio to the power in a fourth realisation. The rms errors for each power spectrum calculation are also shown. As expected the finite volume error decreases as k increases due to the greater number of modes present at higher wavenumbers. a factor of 1 2 that of the rms error. In order to verify that the effects seen are genuinely due to the difference in dark energy models, another three sets of simulations with the same parameters but different realisations were performed. The scatter in the calculated power spectrum due to dif ferent realisations is shown in Figure 8. The scatter in this figure clearly demonstrates the inability to accurately deter mine the absolute power with the box sizes and number of realisations used in this study due to finite volume errors. From the figures shown it is clear that the difference be tween realisations for a single cosmological model is greater than the difference within a single realisation for the differ ent models. This makes accurate modeling of the absolute value of the power spectrum an extremely challenging task, requiring larger boxes, many more realisations and highly detailed consideration of sources of numerical error. Instead, we are interested in the effect of dark energy models relative 6 Francis, Lewis Linder Figure 9.

Shown are 4 realisations of the ratio between the strongly time varying w0, wa 1.2, 0.663 model and the 1, plotted as a ratio of the main realisation used in the paper. This is a typical example of the magnitude of the variation due to different realisations. to one another and therefore what is important is how much the ratios between models such as shown in Figures 4 6 are affected by different realisations. Fortunately the effect of different realisations is vanishingly small as seen in Fig ure 9, which shows a typical example of the variation in power ratios across the four realisations used. From Figure 9 we can be confident that the computed non linear power spectra ratios are not visibly affected by spurious finite volume errors or effects due to the FFT cal culation of the power spectrum. For cosmological structure probes, we are interested not just in how well we can predict the power

Chunk: state with almost gapless excitations is realized in the wide range of the anisotropy parameter 0 J J 0.25. Furthermore, one dimensionality remained strongly even in J .25 due to the geometrical frustration of interchain cou plings. We consider this one dimensionalization by frus tration as a candidate for the mechanism of the gapless spin liquid state, although the full understanding has not yet been achieved.

Received 2006 Jan 01 Accepted 2006 December 31 ABSTRACT We provide a new estimate of the local supermassive black hole mass function using i the empirical relation between supermassive black hole mass and the S ersic index of the host spheroidal stellar system and ii the measured spheroid S ersic indices drawn from 10k galaxies in the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue. The obser vational simplicity of our approach, and the direct measurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the S ersic index, for both elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it straightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early and late type galaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass function with a Schechter function and find, at the low mass end, a logarithmic slope 1 of 0.7 for the full galaxy sample and 1.0 for the early type galaxy sample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than , and integrating down to black hole masses of 106M , we find that the local mass density of super massive black holes in early type galaxies bh,early 3.5 1.2 105h3 70M Mpc 3, and in late type galaxies bh,late 1.0 0.5 105h3 70M Mpc 3. The uncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include uncer tainties in the Mbh n relation, the catalogue of S ersic indices, the galaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassive black hole mass density is thus bh, 3.2 1.2 10 6h70. That is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that 0.007 0.003 h3 70 per cent of the universe s baryons are presently locked up in supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies. Key words black hole physics galaxies bulges galaxies fundamental param eters galaxies luminosity function, mass function galaxies structure surveys 1 INTRODUCTION Two purely photometric properties of galaxies, or rather their spheroidal1 components, are known to correlate strongly with a galaxy s supermassive black hole SMBH mass Mbh. The first property is optical luminosity Kor mendy 1993 Franceschini et al. 1998 Magorrian et al. 1998 . Due to the observation that SMBHs are associated with the bulge of a galaxy, and not the disc, it is necessary to per form a bulge disc decomposition if one is to properly treat lenticular and late type galaxies. At present, apart from Er win, Graham Caon 2002 their figure 3, with only eight AGraham astro.swin.edu.au Scottish Universities Physics Alliance SUPA 1 By the term spheroidal , we mean an entire elliptical galaxy or the dynamically hot component of a disc galaxy. elliptical and five disc galaxies , no optically2 calibrated rela tion that pertains to both elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies is available. On the other hand, one can simply exclude the disc bulge galaxies and only work with elliptical galaxies e.g., McLure Dunlop 2002, 2004 . In an effort to include all galaxies, we have adopted a second, purely photometric property of galaxies , the S ersic index n Sersic 1963 , Sersic 1968 Graham et al. 2003, 2005 . The S ersic index is a measure of the brightness profile of a galaxy, and is an excellent predictor of the mass-to-light ratio of elliptical galaxies Barden et al. 2005 . We have previously used the S ersic index to estimate the black hole mass Mbh of elliptical galaxies, and found an ex tremely tight correlation between the S ersic index and Mbh e.g. Graham et al. 2005. The main advantage of using the S ersic index, as opposed to optical luminosity, is that the S ersic index can be easily measured for both elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies. This allows a single, comprehensive, model to be constructed that is applicable to both classes of galaxies. It is this relationship between the S ersic index and Mbh that forms the basis of the new estimate of the local supermassive black hole mass function presented here.

Chunk: infrared Mbh Lspheroid relation is presented by Marconi Hunt , updated in Graham . 2 Graham et al. are over estimated in the late type disc galaxies and under estimated in the early type disc galaxies, skewing the mid to low mass end of the SMBH mass function. Another ap proach has been to use the average bulge to total flux ratios derived from past R1 4 bulge exponential disc decomposi tions Simien de Vaucouleurs 1986 . However, Andredakis Sanders showed that Sb and Sc galaxies are, on av erage, better described with an exponential bulge than an R1 4 bulge. Andredakis et al. subsequently showed that an R1 n bulge was more appropriate, with the S ersic index n shown to decrease with increasing disc galaxy type. While an R1 4 bulge plus exponential disc results in an over estimate of the B D ratio when the bulge has a S ersic index c.f. Figures 15 and 1 in Graham 2001 , the use of an exponential bulge exponential disc decomposition re sults in an under estimate of the bulge to disc B D flux ratio when the bulge actually possesses a S ersic profile with Graham 2001, his figure 13 . Therefore, R1 n bulge plus exponential disc fits are required. The various Mbh L relations in the literature predict SMBH masses that differ by factors of two to ten depending on the luminosity. This obviously inhibits the use of the Mbh L relation at present. An investigation of this problem is not undertaken here but presented in Graham . The second3 photometric quantity known to correlate with Mbh is the concentration of the stars in the host spheroidal stellar system Graham et al. 2001, 2003 . This concentration is monotonically related to the shape, i.e. the S ersic index n, of the spheroid s light profile Trujillo, Gra ham Caon 2001, their equation 6 . Moreover, the Mbh n relation is known to be as tightly correlated as the Mbh relation and have the same small degree of scatter see No vak, Faber Dekel 2005 for a recent comparison of these relations . Using an expanded galaxy set 27 galaxies with up dated distances and black hole masses, Graham Driver 2007a have recently shown that the Mbh n relation see Fig.1 is curved rather than linear. Fitting a quadratic equa tion, they obtained log Mbh 7.98 0.09 3.70 0.46 log n 3 3.10 0.84 log n 3 2, with an intrinsic scatter o .18 0.07 0.06 dex. The to tal absolute scatter in log Mbh is 0.31 dex, which compares favourably with the value of 0.34 dex from the log Mbh data and relation in Tremaine et al. . The parameter in front of the second order term in Eq.1 is inconsistent with a value of zero at the 99.99 per cent confidence level. We have explored here whether the departure from a linear relation may have been driven by an increased and uneven scatter, i.e. outliers4, at the high mass end of the Mbh n relation, or whether the curvature is inherent in the rest of the data set. In Fig.2 we show the results of fitting 3 A third photometric quantity that has been predicted to cor relate well with SMBH mass is the central stellar density of the host spheroid Graham Driver 2007a, their section 6 . 4 As noted in Graham Driver 2007a, their Section 3.3 , there is reason to suspect that the highest SMBH mass, pertaining to NGC 4486, may have been overestimated, perhaps by a factor of 4. a log quadratic relation after the removal of the five highest mass data points from Fig.1. The coefficient in front of the quadratic term is again found to be inconsistent with a value of zero, this time at the 99 per cent level, and all three coefficients remain consistent, at the 1

2. How does the Mbh L relation impact the estimation of SMBH masses?
3. How has the Mbh n relation evolved and what is its current state?

Note: The queries are based on the key points in the academic chunk, which include the relationships between infrared Mbh, the spheroidal stellar systems, the Mbh L relation and the Mbh n relation. The queries are designed to address these key points in a concise and direct manner. The academic chunk does not provide specific examples of infrared Mbh or the spheroidal stellar systems, so the queries do not include specific examples. Instead, they focus on understanding the general concepts and their status in current research. The third query is the most specific, asking about the current state of the Mbh n relation and its evolution. This is because the academic chunk provides more information about the Mbh n relation than the other discussed concepts. The chunk mentions that the Mbh n relation is known to be tightly correlated with the Mbh L relation and has a small degree of scatter. It also discusses a recent study that found the Mbh n relation to

The solid, dashed and dotted curves respectively indicate the dispersion curves of 0, and at 0.17fm 3 and 0.2. the interactions as represented by Eq.1 and Eq.41, fail to describe in medium N dynamics as shown in . It was also observed that the chirally symmetric model linear has also various limitations . For example, as mentioned before, it fails to account for the pion nucleus dynamics in nuclear matter both in the PS and PV representations. In fact, it gives too strong pion nucleon interaction in matter which cannot be adjusted by fixing the s wave N interaction in free space even in PV case. In this context the Dirac vacuum involving baryon loops was found to play a significant role. If one uses the chiral model and breaks the symmetry explicitly, the results are found to be very sensitive to the renormalization scheme . In it was shown that the relativistic chiral models with a light scalar meson appear to provide an economical marriage of successful relativistic MFT and chiral symmetry. It, however, fails to reproduce observed properties of finite nuclei, such as spin orbit splittings, shell structure, charge densities and surface energies. Since then, there has been series of attempts to construct a model which has the virtue of describing both the properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei . Currently, the non linear chiral effective field theoretic approach seems to be quite successful in this respect. It might be recalled here, that, in such a framework, the explicit calculation of the Dirac vacuum is not required, rather, on the contrary, here, the short distance dynamics are absorbed into the parame ters of the theory adjusted phenomenologically by fitting empirical data . Now we proceed to cal culate the effective pion masses in ANM in this approach. By retaining only the lowest order terms in the pion fields, one obtains the following Lagrangian from the chi rally invariant Lagrangian i M gs s g gA f 5 1 2 s s m2 s 2 s 1 2 m2 2 1 4G G 1 2m2 LNL L The terms LNL and L contain, respectively the nonlinear terms of the meson sector and all of the counterterms. The explicit expressions for LNL and L can be found in . It is to be noted that the meson self energy can be found by differentiating the energy density at the two loop level with respect to the meson propagator as indicated in Fig 10. One may therefore, identify the FF, FD and DD parts of the self energy with the vacuum fluctuation VF , Lamb shift LS and exchange EX contributions to the self energy respectively. The VF and LS terms are related to the short range physics while EX part is related to the long range physics. The detailed discussion about this short and long distance separation can be found in . The diverging FF part of the self energy and LS can be expressed as a sum of terms which already exists in the effective field theoretical Lagrangian and can be absorbed into the counter terms. The short distance physics, as shown in , while calculating exchange energies, are either removed by field redefinitions or the coefficients are determined by fitting with the empirical data. The long range part is computed explicitly that produce modest corrections to the nuclear binding energy curve. This can be compensated by a small adjustment of the coupling parameters. Recently in ref. the exchange energy contributions of pion has been calculated within this theoretical frame work. We adopt the same parameter set as designated by MOA in to calculate the self energy explicitly.

Chunk: persistent charge current exhibits oscillations with increasing the value of R for both the systems with even or odd number of electrons. Therefore by tuning the SO coupling strength, the magnetic response of this system can change from paramagnetic to diamagnetic and vice versa. It indicates that SO coupling can play a important role in electron transport in this mesoscopic ring. The curve of the persistent charge current for odd number of electrons shows discontinuity in its derivation, this can be attributed the level crossing in the energy spectrum by changing R. It is also noted that the position of this discontinuity for odd N also corresponds to the peak or valley in even N case. Since the electron has the spin degree of freedom as well as the charge, the electron motion in the ring may give rise to a spin current besides the charge current. Now we turn to study the persistent spin current in the ground state. The spin current operator is defined 6 by v v vv 2, which can be written explicitly as h 2 i v R 2 x cos y sin v h.c. , Therefore the three component of spin current operator in terms of creation and annihi lation operators are given by h 2 X m c m cm c m cm m , h 2 X m c m cm c m cm m R 2 X m, c m 1 c m 1 cm , h 2i X m c m cm c m cm m i R 2 X m, c m 1 c m 1 cm , The expectation value of the spin current 0 Jv 0 . In our calculation we find that only the z component of the spin current is nonzero in the ground state. Fig.3 shows the persistent spin current Jz vs. magnetic flux at different SO coupling strength. The persistent spin current is a periodic function of the magnetic flux , which has the even parity symmetry Jz Jz and also an additional symmetry Jz Jz . It is noted that the persistent spin current has quite different dependence behaviors on magnetic flux compared with the persistent charge current in Fig.1. In the presence of finite SO coupling, the persistent spin current is nonzero both for the systems with odd N and even N at zero magnetic flux, it indicates that a persistent spin current can be induced solely by SO interaction without accompany a charge current. This phenomena is also shown in Ref. where a SO coupling normal hybrid ring was considered. In Fig.4 the persistent spin current Jz as a function of SO coupling strength is plotted. In the absence of SO coupling , the persistent spin current is exactly zero for both even and odd number electron system. In the presence of SO coupling, The persistent spin current becomes nonzero and shows oscillations with increasing R. It can change from positive to negative values or vice versa by tuning the SO coupling strength. The sign of the persistent spin current also shows dependence on the enclosed magnetic flux. For the system with odd N, there is abrupt jumps in the curve of persistent spin current at certain value of R, the reason for the jump is the same as that in the charge current, and is due to the level crossing in the energy spectrum. It is noted that the position of the jump coincides with 7 that of the persistent charge current. This kind of characteristic feature of the persistent currents might provide a useful way to detect the SO coupling effects in semiconductor ring system. IV. CONCLUSIONS In summary, we have investigated the Rashba SO coupling effect on the persistent charge current and spin current in a mesoscopic ring with an Anderson impurity. The Anderson impurity leads to the Kondo effect and decreases the amplitude of the persistent

Chunk: charge and spin current in the ring. In the semiconducting ring with SO interaction, the persistent charge current changes significantly by tuning the SO coupling strength, e.g. from the paramagnetic to diamagnetic current. Besides the persistent charge current, there also exists a persistent spin current, which also oscillates with the SO coupling strength. It is shown that at zero magnetic flux a persistent spin current can exist even without the charge current. Since the persistent spin current can generate an electric field , one might expect that experiments on semiconductor ring with Rashba SO coupling can detect the persistent spin current.

Chunk: spin band moves significantly below o F and the contributions at o F appears only due to the down spin states indicating a half metallic behav ior. No contribution of the up spin states observed in the total density of states not shown here . Considering the paucity of half metallic materials for various tech nological applications, achieving half metallicity in the ferromagnetic SrRuO3 by Ti substitution is remarkable. It is believed that the half metallicity can be achieved via strong d d hybridization in Heusler alloys involv ing two transition metal elements in the compound . In transition metal oxides, often doping of large amount of electrons or holes leads to a shift of the Fermi level towards the energy gap of one spin channel leading to half metallicity . The primary difficulty to use these systems in technological applications is the loss of half metallicity at elevated temperatures, where thermal ex citations leads to significant mixing of various spin chan nels due to small energy gap at o F . In the present case, mechanism to achieve half metallicity is simple and easily achievable experimentally. The most important aspect is that the energy gap between t2g and eg bands can be tailored judiciously by tuning the composition to minimize thermal effects. In summary, we investigate the possibility of fabricat ing half metallicity by Ti substitution at the Ru sites in a ferromagnetic material, SrRuO3. The calculated re sults using FLAPW method within the local spin density approximations reveal tetravalency of Ti in all the com positions consistent with the experimental predictions. The Ru 4d band exhibit significant narrowing with the increase in Ti substitution the crystal field splitting re mains almost the same across the whole series. Thus, an energy gap develops between the t2g and eg bands, which gradually grows with the increase in x. Conse quently, the up spin density of states exhibit an energy gap at the Fermi level, while the down spin states still contribute leading to half metallicity. Most interestingly, the t2g eg gap can be engineered by tuning x and thus spin mixing effects due to thermal excitations can be min imized. This study thus provide a novel but simple way to fabricate half metallicity in ferromagnetic materials, which are potential candidates for spin based technol ogy. Experimental realization of this method would help both chemists and physicists to cultivate new materials. In addition, this study demonstrates that effective sin gle particle approaches provide a remarkable description of the electronic properties of these systems, which are predicted experimentally.

Chunk: outwardly rotating spiral wave is com pletely stable everywhere, and fills in the space when the proper parameters are chosen, as shown in Fig. 3 A . Fig ure 3 A shows a series of snapshots of a well developed single spiral wave formed spontaneously for the variable p in system . The spiral is initiated on a 600 600 grid by the cross field protocol the initial distribution chosen in the form of allocated constant gradient perturbation of the co existence steady state and zero boundary con ditions are employed for simulations in the two dimen sions. From Fig. 3 A we can see that the well developed spiral waves are formed firstly by the evolution. Inside the domain, new waves emerge, but are evolved by the spiral wave growing from the center. The spiral wave can steadily grow and finally prevail over the whole do main a movie illustrating the dynamical evolution for this case partly movie 1, movie 2, and movie 3 for .2 .

The size of the surviv ing part of the spiral does not shrink when dh is further decreasing until finally dh equals to 0, which is different from phenomenon that is observed previous in the two dimensional space Belousov Zhabotinsky and FitzHugn Nagumo oscillatory system , in which the breakup gradually invaded the stable region near the core center, and finally the spiral wave broke up in the whole medium. Figure 3 C is the time sequences ar bitrary units of the variables p and h at an arbitrary spatial point within the spiral wave region, from which we can see that the spiral waves are caused by the ac cepted as phase waves with substantially group veloc ity, phase velocity and sinusoidal oscillation rather than the relaxational oscillation with large amplitude. This breakup scenario is similar to the breakup of rotating spiral waves observed in numerical simulation in chemi cal systems , and experiments in BZ systems , which shows that spiral wave breakup in these systems was related to the Eckhaus instability and more important, the absolute instability.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0324v1 math.AP 3 Apr 2007 ON THE PSEUDOSPECTRUM OF ELLIPTIC QUADRATIC DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS Karel Pravda Starov University of California, Berkeley Abstract. We study the pseudospectrum of a class of non selfadjoint differential operators. Our work consists in a detailed study of the microlocal properties, which rule the spectral stability or instability phenomena appearing under small pertur bations for elliptic quadratic differential operators. The class of elliptic quadratic differential operators stands for the class of operators defined in the Weyl quantiza tion by complex valued elliptic quadratic symbols. We establish in this paper a simple necessary and sufficient condition on the Weyl symbol of these operators, which en sures the stability of their spectra. When this condition is violated, we prove that it occurs some strong spectral instabilities for the high energies of these operators, in some regions which can be far away from their spectra. We give a precise geo metrical description of them, which explains the results obtained for these operators in some numerical simulations giving the computation of false eigenvalues far from their spectra by algorithms for eigenvalues computing. Key words. Spectral instability, pseudospectrum, semiclassical quasimodes, non selfadjoint operators, non normal operators, condition , subellipticity. 2000 AMS Subject Classification. 35P05, 35S05. 1. Introduction 1.1. Miscellaneous facts about pseudospectrum. In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in studying the pseudospectrum of non selfadjoint operators. The study of this notion has been initiated by noticing that for certain problems of sci ence and engineering involving non selfadjoint operators, the predictions suggested by spectral analysis do not match with the numerical simulations. This fact lets thinking that in some cases the only knowledge of the spectrum of an operator is not enough to understand sufficiently its action. To supplement this lack of information contained in the spectrum, some new subsets of the complex plane called pseudospectra have been defined. The main idea about the definition of these new subsets is that it is interesting to study not only the points where the resolvent of an operator is not de fined, i.e. its spectrum, but also where this resolvent is large in norm. This explains the following definition of the pseudospectrum A of a matrix or an operator A, A n z C, zI A 1 1 o , for any 0, if we write by convention that zI A A of the operator. Let us mention that there exists an abundant literature about this notion of pseu dospectrum. We refer here for the definition and some general properties of pseu dospectra to the paper of L.N. Trefethen. Let us also point out the more recently published book , which draws up a wide all round view of this topic and gives a lot of illustrations. According to the previous definition, studying the pseudospectra of an operator is exactly studying the level lines of the norm of its resolvent. What is interesting in studying such level lines is that it gives some information about the spectral stability 1 2 of the operator. Indeed, pseudospectra can be defined in an equivalent way in term of spectra of perturbations of the operator. For instance, we have for any A Mn C , A . It follows that a complex number z belongs to the pseudospectrum of a matrix A if and only if it belongs to the spectrum of one of its perturbations A B with B . More generally, if A is a closed unbounded linear operator with a dense domain on a complex Hilbert space H, the result of Roch and Silbermann in gives that A B L H , B L H A B , where L H stands for the set of bounded linear operators on H. From this second description, we understand the interest in studying such subsets if we want for example to compute numerically some eigenvalues of an operator. Indeed, we start to

Chunk: of the numerical range for the associated semiclassical operator, is a direct consequence of a result proved by E.B. Davies in Theorem 1 and the absence of semiclassical pseudospectrum of index 2 3 on the boundary of the numerical range has been proved for the ro tated harmonic oscillator in 4. As we have previously mentioned see 2.1.10 and 3.0.2 , the property of non normality, the order of symbols and the semiclassical pseudospectra of elliptic quadratic differential operators are symplectically invariant. These properties allow us to reduce by any real linear symplectic transformations the symbols of the elliptic quadratic differential operators that we consider in our proof of the theorem 2.2.1 and the theorem 2.2.2. By using the lemma 3.1.1, we deduce from the results of the theorem 2.2.1 and the theorem 2.2.2 proved for the rotated harmonic oscillator that they are therefore also fulfilled by all non normal one dimensional el liptic quadratic differential operators with a numerical range different from the whole complex plane. We now consider the multidimensional case. As we will see in the following, there is a real jump of complexity between the one dimensional case and the multidimensional one. This jump is among other things a consequence of the complexity increase of symplectic geometry in dimension n 2 and the larger diversity appearing in the class of elliptic quadratic differential operators. 4Let us recall that the value of the order is equal to 2 in this case. 22 3.2. Case of dimension n 2. We only need to study the case of a non normal elliptic quadratic differential operator 3.2.1 q x, w B L2 Rn , in dimension n 2. Let us recall that in this case, the numerical range q is a closed angular sector with a top in 0 and a positive opening strictly lower than , and that the proposition 2.1.2 gives that 3.2.2 x0, 0 R2n, x0, 0 0. Let us begin by studying what occurs at the interior of the numerical range q . 3.2.1. On the pseudospectrum at the interior of the numerical range. To prove the existence of semiclassical quasimodes for the associated semiclassical operator given by the theorem 2.2.1, we need a first purely algebraic step to characterize the points belonging to the interior of the numerical range. Let us consider the following decomposition of the numerical range 3.2.3 q A B, where 3.2.4 z q x0, 0 R2n, x0, 0 , x0, 0 0 and 3.2.5 z q x0, 0 x0, 0 0 . The next section is devoted to give a geometrical description of these two sets. We establish using purely algebraic arguments that 3.2.6 q and q . This result is a consequence of the geometry induced by the quadratic setting to which the studied symbols belong. Let us begin by noticing that the symplectic invariance of the Poisson bracket 2.1.10 induces the same property for the sets A and B. We can therefore use some real linear symplectic transformation to reduce the symbol q. z 2 , we deduce from this symplectic invariance, from the proposition 2.1.1 and the lemma 18.6.4 in that after a similitude, we can reduce our study to the case where 3.2.7 Re q x, n X j 2 j x2 j , with 1, ..., n. 3.2.1.a. Geometrical description of the sets A and B. We begin by proving the fol lowing inclusion 3.2.8 q B. Let us consider z q and x0, 0 R2n such that x0, 0 . This is possible because the numerical range is a closed angular sector. If , the ellipticity property of q implies that x0, 0 0, 0 and x0, 0 0, because this Poisson bracket is also a quadratic form. This proves that z B. If z q , 23 let us consider the global solution Y of the linear Cauchy problem 3.2.9 Y t H1 Rn, Y t H1 Rn, Y t H1 Rn . By Duhamel's formula, we get 3.2.10 Y t = T t +, where x0, 0 . This implies that x0, 0 0, which proves that z B. 3.2.1.b. The Poisson bracket vanishes on the set q . We now prove that 3.2.11 q A. Let us consider x0, 0 R2n such that x0, 0 x0, 0 0. This is possible because the numerical range is a closed angular sector. If , the ellipticity property of q implies that x0, 0 x0, 0 0 and x0, 0 0, which proves that x0, 0 A. If , 23 to prove that x0, 0 A, it is sufficient to prove that the Poisson bracket 3.2.12 vanishes on the set q . This is a consequence of the fact that the Poisson bracket is also a quadratic form and of the geometry induced by the quadratic setting to which the studied

Chunk: Y t x0, 0 , associated to the Hamilton vector field of the symbol Re q, HRe 1 Re q j xj Re q xj j . It is actually a linear Cauchy problem since Re q is a quadratic form. Setting f t Im q Y t , a direct computation gives that f x0, 0 . If f 0, we could find t0 0 such that f t0 f Im z . Since Y is the flow associated to the Hamilton vector field of Re q, the quadratic form Re q is constant under it. It follows that for all t R, Re q Y t Re q Y Re z and provides a contradiction because, since z q , this would imply in view of the shape of the numerical range q see Figure 7 that q Y t0 q . It follows that the Poisson bracket x0, 0 is necessary equal to 0 and Figure 7. z q q Y t 0 O that z B. This ends the proof of the inclusion 3.2.8 . Let us now assume that 3.2.10 q B, q B. In this case, we could find 3.2.11 z B q . 24 Let us first notice that z is necessary non zero since 0 q , and that Re , since from 3.2.7 , 3.2.12 q . The fact that z belongs to the set B implies that 3.2.13 Re q x, Re z Im q x, Im z x, 0. We also know that there exists at least one solution to the system appearing in the left hand side of 3.2.13 . Since from 3.2.7 , the quadratic form Re q is positive definite, we can simultaneously reduce the quadratic forms Re q and Im q by finding an isomorphism P of R2n such that in the new coordinates x, , 3.2.14 Re q Py 2n X Py 2n X jy2 j with 1 ... n. Let us now consider the following quadratic form 3.2.15 p y Py . We get from 3.2.13 and 3.2.14 that 3.2.16 P2n Re z P2n jy2 p y 0. Let us underline that the isomorphism P is not a priori a symplectic transformation and that it does not preserve the Poisson bracket . We consider the two following sets 3.2.17 y R2n r y 0 , where 3.2.18 r y 2n X j Im z Re z y2 j and 3.2.19 y R2n p y 0 . The next lemma gives a first inclusion between these two sets E1 and E2. Lemma 3.2.1. We have 3.2.20 E1 E2. Proof of Lemma 3.2.1. Let y E1. If 3.2.15 , p is a quadratic form in the variable y. If y 0, we set 1 y2 1, ..., 2n, . We recall from 3.2.12 that z B q implies that Re . Then, since, on one hand 2n X y2 , 25 and that, on the other hand, we have from 3.2.17 and 3.2.18 that 2n X j y2 1 jy2 1 Im z Re z y2 , because y E1, we deduce from 3.2.16 and the homogeneity of degree 2 of the quadratic form p that p y Re z t p y 0. According to 3.2.19 , this proves that y E2 and ends the proof of the lemma 3.2.1. Then, we can notice from 3.2.14 that the boundary of the numerical range q is given by 3.2.21 1 i 1 R 1 i n R . Since the numerical range q is a closed set, the assumption z B q q q q , induces from 3.2.21 that Im z Re z 1, n . This implies that the signature r1, s1 of the quadratic form r defined in 3.2.18 fulfills 3.2.22 r1, s1 N N and r1 s1 2n. Thus, we can apply the next lemma to the signature r1, s1 of the quadratic form r. Lemma 3.2.2. If r1, s1 N N and r1 s1 2n, then 3.2.23 r1 s1 2n. Proof of Lemma 3.2.2. Since 3.2.22, the inequalities 3.2.24 r1 s1 r1 s1 r1 s1 r1 s1 r1 s1 are equivalent to the inequalities . Thus, using the fact that the quadratic form r is positive definite, we deduce that 3.2.23 r1 s1 2n. This ends the proof of Lemma 3.2.2. From 3.2.23 and the fact that r is a positive definite quadratic form, we deduce that 3.2.24 r1 s1 r1 s1 r1 s1 r1 s1, which implies that 3.2.25 r1 s1 2n r1 s1 2n r1 s1 2n r1 s1 2n

Chunk: 1 ... ar1y2 r1 ar1 1y2 r1 1 ... ar1 s1y2 r1 s1, with 1, ..., r1 s1. It follows from 3.2.17 and 3.2.23 that in these new coordinates, the set E1 is the direct product of a proper cone C of Rr1 s1 and R2n r1 s1, 3.2.24 R2n r1 s1. Figure 8. E R 2 nr 1 s 1 . C We are now going to prove that the two sets E1 and E2 are equal 3.2.25 . Let us reason by the absurd by assuming that it is not the case. Then, we could find from the lemma 3.2.1, 3.2.26 y0 E2 E1, y 0, y 0 with y 0 Rr1 s1, y 0 R2n r1 s1. We deduce from 3.2.24 that y 0 C. Let us now recall an elementary geometrical fact that we will use several times. This fact is that the intersection of a real line and 26 a real quadric surface is reduced to either 0, 1 or 2 points, or the line is completely contained in the quadric surface. We first begin by proving that 3.2.27 Rr1 s1 y y 0 E2. Indeed, let us consider the affine subspace y R2n y , y Rr1 s1 R2n r1 s1, y y 0 . We identify for more simplicity the space F to the space Rr1 s1. We agree to say that a point x 0 of Rr1 s1 belongs to the set E2 to mean that the point x 0, y 0 belongs to the set E2. With this convention, it is sufficient for proving the inclusion 3.2.27 to consider some particular lines of Rr1 s1, containing the point y 0 defined in 3.2.26 and, which have an intersection with the cone C in at least two other different points u 0 and v 0 see Figure 9 . These lines are necessary contained in the quadric surface E2 because from the lemma 3.2.1, E1 E2, and that there are at least three different points of intersection between these lines and the quadric surface E2, u 0, y 0 C R2n r1 , v 0, y 0 C R2n r1 , and y 0, y 0 E2. Thus, we prove that the shaded disc appearing on the figure 10 is completely contained in the set E2. By using the cone structure of the set E2, we can deduce that all the interior of the cone C see Figure 11 is contained in E2. Then, using again other particular intersections with some lines as on the figure 12, we deduce from our identification of the space F to Rr1 s1 that the inclusion 3.2.27 is fulfilled. Figure 9. y 0 0 C 0 We now prove that under these conditions, we have the identity 3.2.28 . Indeed, let us consider y 0, y 0 R2n r1 s1. If y 0 C, then y 0, y 0 E2, 27 Figure 10. y 0 C These three points belong to E2. The line D is contained in E2. D Figure 11. C 0 because from 3.2.20 and 3.2.24 , y 0, y 0 E1 and E1 E2. If, on the other hand y 0 C, we can choose a point u Rr1 s1 different from y 0 such that u C, and such that the line containing y 0 and u in Rr1 s1, has an intersection with C in at least two other different points v and w see Figure 13 . Thus, we can find some distinct real numbers t1, t2 R such that 1 t1 y 0 t1u C and 1 t2 y 0 t2u C. Considering now the line 1 t y 0, y 0 t u, y 0 t R , we can notice that this real line contains at least three different points of E2, namely y 0, y 0 u C R2n r1 s1, y 0, y 0 u C R2n r1 s1, and y 0, y 0 u D Rr1 s1. These three points belong to E2. The line D is contained in E2. Thus, under our conditions, we have the identity 3.2.28 28 . Figure 12.

Chunk: such an operator since we have D2 x ei 2 ei x2 w, , if . This operator is a very simple example of non selfadjoint operator for which we have noticed on the previous numerical simulation that it occurs some strong 4 spectral instabilities under small perturbations for its high energies. These phenomena have been studied in several recent works. We can mention in particular the works of L.S. Boulton , E.B. Davies , K. Pravda Starov and M. Zworski , which have given a good understanding of these phenomena. A question, which has been at the origin of this work, has been to study if these phenomena peculiar to the rotated harmonic oscillator are representative, or not, of what occurs more generally in the class of elliptic quadratic differential operators in every dimension. We have tried to answer to the following questions Does it always occur some strong spectral instabilities under small perturba tions for the high energies of these operators ? If it is not the case, is it possible to give a necessary and sufficient condition on the Weyl symbols of these operators, which ensures their spectral stability ? Can we precisely describe the geometry, which separates the regions of the resolvent sets where the resolvents of these operators blow up in norm from the ones where one keeps a control on their sizes ? To understand these spectral stability or instability phenomena, we need to study the microlocal properties, which rule these phenomena in the class of elliptic quadratic differential operators. Let us mention that it is M. Zworski who first underlined in the close link between these questions of spectral instabilities and some results of microlocal analysis about the solvability of pseudodifferential operators. 1.3. Semiclassical pseudospectrum. To answer to these previous questions, it is interesting to use a semiclassical setting and to study a notion of pseudospectrum in this new setting. We define for a semiclassical family Ph Rn , with a domain D, the following notions of semiclassical pseudospectra. Definition 1.3.1. For all 0, the set sc Ph z C , , h0, Ph z 1 Ch , is called semiclassical pseudospectrum of index of the semiclassical family Ph . The semiclassical pseudospectrum of infinite index is defined by sc Ph 0 sc Ph . With this definition, the points in the complement of the semiclassical pseudospectrum of index are the points of the complex plane where we have the following control of the resolvent s norm for sufficiently small values of the semiclassical parameter h, 1.3.1 , , h0, Ph z . To prove the existence of semiclassical pseudospectrum of index , we will study the question of existence of semiclassical quasimodes 1.3.2 , , h0, uh D, uh L2 Rn 1 and Phuh zuh L2 Rn Ch , in some points z of the resolvent set, which can be considered as some almost eigen values in O h in the semiclassical limit. Let us notice that the definition chosen here for the notions of semiclassical pseudospectra differ from the one given in for a semiclassical pseudodifferential operator. In fact, we have chosen a definition for semiclassical pseudospectra inspired by the remark made p.388 in , because this definition only depends on the properties of the semiclassical operator rather than on its symbol. 5 The interest of working in a semiclassical setting is a matter of geometry. We can explain this choice by the fact that it is easier for an elliptic quadratic differential oper ator q x, w to describe the geometry of semiclassical pseudospectra of its associated semiclassical operator q x, h w , than to describe directly the geometry of its pseudospectra. The semiclassical setting is particularly well adapted for the study of elliptic quadratic differential operators because there exists a simple link between this semiclassical setting and the quantum one. Indeed, using that the symbols of these operators

Queries:
1. What is the relationship between spectral instabilities and elliptic quadratic differential operators?
2. How do microlocal properties impact spectral stability or instability phenomena in elliptic quadratic differential operators?
3. What is the connection between pseudospectra and the semiclassical setting in elliptic quadratic differential operators?

These queries explore the complex relationship between spectral instabilities, microlocal properties, and pseudospectra in the context of elliptic quadratic differential operators. They aim to understand the underlying mechanisms and properties of these phenomena, as well as the potential applications and implications for the broader field of differential operators. By examining these connections, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the behavior and characteristics of elliptic quadratic differential operators and potentially develop new tools and techniques to study and control them.

In particular, Query 1 seeks to uncover the relationship between spectral instabilities and elliptic quadratic differential operators. It aims to understand how these instabilities arise and how they can be characterized in the context of these operators. Query 2 focuses on the role of microlocal properties in influencing spectral stability or instability phenomena in elliptic quadratic differential operators. This query

Chunk: are some quadratic forms q, we obtain from the change of variables, 0, the following identity between the quantum operator q x, w and its associated semiclassical operator q x, h w , 1.3.3 q x, w z y, h w z , if z C. This identity allows to get some information about the resolvent s norm behaviour of the quantum operator q x, w z 1, if we have some information about semiclassical pseudospectra for its associated semi classical operator. Let us mention for example that if a non zero complex number z belongs to the semiclassical pseudospectrum of infinite index of the operator q x, h w , the identity 1.3.3 induces that the resolvent s norm of the quantum operator blows up along the half line zR with a rate faster than any polynomials 1.3.4 N N, , 0 1, 0, q x, w z 1 C N, and this, even if this half line zR does not intersect the spectrum of the opera tor q x, w. Conversely, in the case where z sc q y, h w , z 0 and 0 1, the identity 1.3.3 shows that we can find some positive constants C1 and C2 such that the resolvent of the operator q x, w remains bounded in norm in some regions of the resolvent set of the shape 1.3.5 u C u C1, d , u C2 proj u 1 C q x, w , . Indeed, we obtain from 1.3.1 and 1.3.3 that , 0 1, 0, q x, w eiargz 1, which induces that for all v D q x, w and 0, q x, w eiargz v L2 Rn C 1 1 v L2 Rn , if D q x, w stands for the domain of the operator q x, w. Then, we can find a constant 0 1 such that if z belongs to u C u 0, d eiargzR , u 2 1C 1 projeiargzR u 1 C q x, w , then projeiargzR z 0. This induces using the previous estimates and the triangular inequality that if z belongs to u C u 0, d eiargzR , u 2 1C 1 projeiargzR u 1 C q x, w , 6 we have for all v D q x, w , q x, w z v L2 q x, w projeiargzR z v L2 d eiargzR , z v L2 2 1C 1 projeiargzR z 1 v L2 2 1C 1 1 0 v L2, because 1. This last estimate shows that the resolvent of the operator q x, w is bounded in norm by 2C 1 0 on the set u C u 0, d eiargzR , u 2 1C 1 projeiargzR u 1 C q x, w . We notice that depending directly on the value of the index , 0 1, the previous set contains more or less deeply in its interior the half line . This fact explains why in the following we will precise carefully the index of the semiclassical pseudospectrum to which a point does not belong when there is no semiclassical pseudospectrum of infinite index in that point. 2.

Chunk: the free fluctuations caused by turbulence alone. Measurement of the displacement r t caused by the turbulent forcing f t is performed with small piezoelectric transducers. We measure the average response, i.e. the displacement on one end caused by a known broad band forcing on the other end. Then, measurements of the displacement on one end alone give information on the forcing fluctuations. Our study goes a step forward, in an exploratory way. Knowing the average response function of the string and measuring r t , we invoque a version of the Fluctuation Dissipation Theorem extended out of equilibrium, to define an effective temperature of the turbulent flow. This effective temperature happends to be scale dependant. In this work, fully developped turbulence is addressed from the point of view of statistical mechanics. We first recall one important break through the statement of the Fluctuation Dissipation Theorem FDT . Consider a pair of conjugate variables displacement r and force f of a small system in thermal contact with a large heat reservoir. In the present case the small system is the string, coupled to the turbulent flow which is the reservoir. Displacement r and force f are conjugate in the sense that their product is the work exerted by the flow on the string. The theorem originates from the idea that spontaneous fluctuations r t should have the same statistical properties as the relaxation of r t after the removal of an external forcing perturbation. The main hypothesis needed to derive this theorem are linear response between f and r, thermal equilibrium between the system under consideration and the thermostat, thermal equilibrium of the thermostat itself. The response function Hr,f is such that r t R t Hx,f t t f t dt . Equivalently it can be written in the Fourier space as r Hr,f f . Under some hypothesis, the fluctuations of r its 2 times correlation function are linked by a very simple relation with the dissipative response of the system to a perturbation of the conjugate variable f imaginary part of the average response function . It is simply proportional, and the coefficient is nothing but the temperature multiplied by the Boltzman constant kBT . The validity of the hypothesis has to be discussed in each case. If they are satisfied, the correlation function of the spontaneous fluctuations is proportional to the response function, i.e. the factor is unique and constant. Moreover, this factor Measurements of a dynamical temperature in turbulence. 3 is the same for all couples of conjugate variables, and this factor is kBT , where T is the temperature of the system. The Boltzman constant kB 1.38 10 23JK 1 is an universal constant. This relation can be expressed in spectral variables 2 kBT Im Hr,f . In this expression of the FDT, is the power spectral density of the fluctuations of the displacement r, as Hr,f is the response function on r to the conjugate variable f. Because the string is very thin, the drag is purely viscous. It is therefore proportional to the velocity, which is in quadrature with the displacement. The dissipation is therefore proportional to the imaginary part of the average response function Im H . In the perspective of constructing a non equilibrium thermodynamics, the FDT has been reconsidered by L. Cugliandolo and J. Kurchan, while investigating amorphous materials relaxing after a thermal quench through the glass transition . We present in the following an exploratory approach of the question of turbulent fluctuations using their extended formalism. The Fluctuation Dissipation Ratio FDR can be rewritten Im Hr,f 2 kBTeff. , where the temperature is replaced by an effective temperature Teff., function of frequency . The frequency dependence of Teff. expresses the fact that different degrees of freedom are not at equilibrium with each other, resulting in internal energy fluxes. In other words, in our system, each independent mode of

Chunk: Lebesgue integrable in 0 q 1. Again a characterization of Shannon entropy is obtained. In all the characterization theorems for Shannon entropy this recursivity property enters in one form or the other as a postulate, which in effect implies a logarithmic form for the entropy 3 measure. Shannon entropy Sk has the following form 1 pi ln pi, , , ..., k, p1 ... , where A is a constant. If any pi is assumed to be zero then 0 ln 0 is to be interpreted as zero. Since the constant A is present, logarithm can be taken to any base. Usually the logarithm is taken to the base 2 for ready application to binary systems. We will take logarithm to the base e. 1.3. Generalization of Shannon entropy Consider again a multinomial population p1, ..., pk , , , ..., k, p1 ... . The following are some of the generalizations of Shannon entropy Sk. Rk, P ln Pk i 1 , 1, 0, R enyi entropy of order of 1961 Hk, P Pk i 1 21 1 , 1, 0 Havrda Charv at entropy of order of 1967 Tk, P Pk i 1 1 , 1, 0 Tsallis entropy of 1988 Mk, P Pk i 1 1 , 1, 2 entropic form of order M k, P ln Pk i 1 , 1, 2, additive entropic form of order . When 1 all the entropies of order described above in to go to Shannon entropy Sk. lim 1 Rk, P lim 1 Hk, P lim 1 Tk, P lim 1 Mk, P lim 1 M k, P Sk. Hence all the above measures are called generalized entropies of order . Let us examine to see what happens to the above entropies in the case of a joint distribution. Let , , ..., m, , ..., n such that Pm 1 . This is a bivariate situation of a discrete distribution. Then the entropy in the joint distribution, for example, Mm,n, P, Q Pm 1 p2 ij 1 1 . 4 If the PPP holds and if , p1 ... , q1 ... , , , ..., m, , , ..., n and if p1, ..., pm , q1, ..., qn then 1 Mm, P Mn, Q 1 1 m X i 1 ! n X j 1 1 1 m X 1 p2 i q2 j m X i n X j 1 Mm,n, P, Q Mm, P Mn, Q . Therefore Mm,n, P, Q Mm, P Mn, Q 1 Mm, P Mn, Q . If any one of the above mentioned generalized entropies in to is written as Fm,n, P, Q then we have the relation Fm,n, P, Q Fm, P Fn, Q a Fm, P Fn, Q . where a 0 R enyi entropy Rk, P 21 1 Havrda Charv at entropy Hk, P 1 Tsallis entropy Tk, P 1 entropic form of order , i.e., Mk, P 0 additive entropic form of order , i.e., M k, P . When a 0 the entropy is called additive and when a 0 the entropy is called non additive. As can be expected, when a logarithmic function is involved, as in the cases of Sk P , Rk, P , M k, P , the entropy is additive and a 0. 1.4. Extensions to higher dimensional joint distributions Consider a trivariate population or a trivariate discrete distribution , , ..., m, , ..., n, , ..., r such that Pm 1 Pr 1. If the PPP holds mutually, that is, pair wise as well as jointly, which then will imply that , m X 1, n X 1, r X 1, p1, ..., pm , q1, ..., qn , s1, ..., sr . Then proceeding as before, we have for any of the measures described above in to , calling it F , Fm,n,r, P, Q, R Fm Fn Fr Fm, P Fn, Q Fm, P Fn, R Fm, P Fn, Q 1 F. The same applies to higher dimensional joint distributions. This can be generalized in to a continuous distribution for a vector valued random variable and for a vector valued function . 1.5. Applications of Shannon entropy and its generalizations Application of Shannon entropy and its generalizations are found in various fields, including but not limited to, information theory, statistical mechanics, and statistical inference.

Chunk: Fm, P Fn, Q Fr, S a Fm, P Fn, Q Fm, P Fr, S Fn, Q Fr, S a 2Fm, P Fn, Q Fr, S 5 where a is the same as in . The same procedure can be extended to any multivariable situation. If a 0 we may call the entropy additive and if a 0 then the entropy is non additive. 1.5. Crucial recursivity postulate Consider the multinomial population p1, ..., pk , , , ..., k, p1 ... . Let the entropy measure to be determined through appropriate postulates be denoted by Hk P Hk p1, ..., pk . For x H2 x, 1 x , 0 x 1 or x . If another parameter is to be involved in H2 x, 1 x then we will denote f x by f x . From to it can be seen that the generalized entropies of order of Havrda Charv at , Tsallis 1988, 2004 and Shannon entropy satisfy the functional equation f x b x f y 1 x f y b x f x 1 y for x, y 0, with x y , with the boundary condition f f where b x 1 x Shannon entropy Sk P 1 x Harvda Charv at entropy Hk, P 1 x Tsallis entropy Tk, P 1 x 2 entropic form of order , i.e., Mk, P . Observe that the normalizing constant at , P and it is different for other entropies. Thus equations , , , with the appropriate normalizing constants f 1 2 , can give characterization theorems for the various entropy measures. The form of b x is coming from the crucial recursivity postulate, assumed as a desirable property for the measures. 1.6. Continuous analogues In the continuous case let f x be the density function of a real random variable x. Then the various entropy measures, corresponding to the ones in to are the following R f 1 1 ln Z f x dx , 1, 0 R enyi entropy of order H f 1 21 1 Z f x dx 1 , 1, 0 6 Havrda Charv at entropy of order T f 1 1 Z f x dx 1 , 1, 0, Tsallis entropy of order M f 1 1 Z f x 2 dx 1 , 1, 2 entropic form of order M f 1 1 ln Z f x 2 dx , 1, 2 additive entropic form of order . As expected, Shannon entropy in this case is given by S f A Z f x ln f x dx where A is a constant. Note that when PPP product probability property or statistical indepen dence holds then in the continuous case also we have the property in and and then non additivity holds for the measures analogous to the ones in , , , with a remaining the same. Since the steps are parallel a separate derivation is not given here. 2. Maximum Entropy Principle If we have a multinomial population p1, ..., pk , , , ..., k, p1 ... Ai pi, A1 ... , P S 1, Ai , i j then we know that the maximum uncertainty in the scheme or the minimum information from the scheme is obtained when we cannot give any preference to the occurrence of any particular event or when the events are equally likely or when ... . In this case, Shannon entropy becomes, Sk P Sk 1 k , ..., 1 k A k X A ln k and this is the maximum uncertainty or maximum Shannon entropy in this scheme. If the arbitrary functional f is to be fixed by maximizing the entropy then in to we have to optimize R f x dx for fixed , over all functional f, subject to the condition R f x x 0 for all x.

Chunk: Fig. 4 c and 4 d for SrRuO3 and SrRu0.5Ti0.5O3, respectively. The increase in U leads to a spectral weight transfer outside the LDA DOS width creating the lower and upper Hub bard bands. Subsequently, the total width of the LDA DOS diminishes gradually. While these results exhibit similar scenario as that observed in the most sophisti cated calculations using dynamical mean field theory, the separation between the lower and upper Hubbard bands is significantly larger than the corresponding values of U. It is important to note here that the band structure cal culations include the electron electron interaction term within the local density approximations. The perturba tion calculations in the present case essentially provide an estimation of the correction in U already included in the effective single particle Hamiltonian.

Chunk: Higgs bosons, W, Z, and the extra U gauge boson in the boson sector, and t, b, k quarks, the lighter chargino, and the three light neutralinos in the fermion sector, because their masses are relatively small as compared with temperature, similarly to the analyses of previous articles . Explicitly, the T 2 terms in the high 6 temperature approximation of VT can be expressed as 2g2 1 6g2 2 6 2 H1 2 H2 2 12 2 S 2 12g 2 1 Q2 1 H1 2 Q2 2 H2 2 Q2 3 S 2 2g 2 1 Q1 Q2 H1 2 H2 2 2g 2 1 Q2 Q3 H2 2 S 2 2g 2 1 Q1 Q3 H1 2 S 2 8g 2 1 Q1 Q2 Q1 H1 2 Q2 H2 2 Q3 S 2 6 h2 t H2 2 h2 b H1 2 h2 k S 2 i . Now, the neutral scalar Higgs fields develop the temperature dependent VEVs, v1 T , v2 T , and s T , which we will simply denote v1, v2, and s, respectively.

Chunk: v1 and v2. By inspecting the shape of on the v1, v2 plane for given parameter values at given temperature, we may determine whether it possess a pair of degenerate vacua or not. In Fig. 2, the equipotential contours of are plotted on the v1, v2 plane, where the parameter values are set as tan 3, 0.8, , , and the temperature is set as , which is actually the critical temperature Tc. One can easily spot two distinct minima of on the v1, v2 plane, namely, one at 0, 0 and the other at 275, 640 GeV. The phase of the state is symmetric at the minimum point 0, 0 on the v1, v2 plane, whereas it is broken at 275, 640 GeV. The electroweak phase transition may take place from 0, 0 to 275, 640 GeV on the v1, v2 plane, which is evidently discontinuous and therefore it is first order. The distance on the v1, v2 plane between the two minima of , defined as vc, determines the strength of the electroweak phase transition. The electroweak phase transition is said to be strong if vc , and weak otherwise. In Fig. 2, the distance is calculated to be 275 0 2 640 0 GeV . In Fig. 2, the strength of the electroweak phase transition is about vc .9, which definitely tells that the electroweak phase transition is a strong one. Therefore, the particular parameter values set for Fig. 2 yields an electroweak phase transition which is first order as well as strong. Note that vc does not depend on s, that is, we need not to know the values of s at the two minima to calculate vc. Actually, vc is the VEV at the broken phase. The masses of the neutral scalar Higgs bosons at zero temperature for the parameter values of Fig. 2 are obtained as , , and . We repeat the above job of analysis, varying the values of the relevant parameters. We find that there are a large number of sets of parameter values that allow strongly first order electroweak phase transitions. Thus, the MSSM with an extra U may accommodate 8 TABLE 1 Some sets of and mA that allow strongly first order electroweak phase transitions in the MSSM with an extra U , obtained by Method A.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0330v1 hep ph 3 Apr 2007 1 Random Matrix Theory at Nonzero and T Kim Splittorff1, and Jacobus Johannes Maria Verbaarschot1,2 ,3 , 1 The Niels Bohr Institute, Blegdamsvej 17, DK 2100, Copenhagen , Denmark 2 Niels Bohr International Academy, Blegdamsvej 17, DK 2100, Copenhagen 3 Department of Physics and Astronomy, SUNY, Stony Brook, New York 11794 We review applications of random matrix theory to QCD at nonzero temperature and chemical potential. The chiral phase transition of QCD and QCD like theories is discussed in terms of eigenvalues of the Dirac operator. We show that for QCD at 0, which has a sign problem, the discontinuity in the chiral condensate is due to an alternative to the Banks Casher relation. The severity of the sign problem is analyzed in the microscopic domain of QCD. 1. Introduction Starting from its introduction in nuclear physics by Wigner,1 random matrix theories have been applied to a wide range of problems ranging from the physics of proteins2 to quantum gravity see3 ,4 for a historical review . Three reasons for the ubiquity of random matrix theory come to mind. First, eigenvalues of large ran dom matrices have universal properties determined by symmetries. Second, random matrices are models for disorder present in many physical systems. Third, random matrix theories have a topological expansion which is important for applications to quantum field theory. One of the attractive features of random matrix theory is that analytical information can be obtained for complex systems which otherwise only can be studied experimentally or numerically. In this review we discuss applications of random matrix theory to QCD at nonzero temperature and chemical potential. Since the order parameter for the chiral phase transition5 ,6 and the deconfining phase transition7 ,8 are determined by the infrared behavior of the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator, these eigenvalues are essential for the phase transitions in QCD. Remarkably, the distribution of the smallest Dirac eigenvalues is given by universal functions9 13 that depend only on one or two parameters, the chiral condensate and the pion decay constant. This offers an alternative way to measure these constants on the lattice.14 22 2. Random Matrix Theory in QCD Chiral Random Matrix Theory chRMT is a theory with the global symmetries of QCD, but matrix elements of the Dirac operator replaced by random numbers9 ,10 m iW iW m , P W e NTrW W . e mail address split nbi.dk e mail address jacobus.verbaarschot stonybrook.edu 2 K.Splittorffand J.J.M. Verbaarschot This random matrix model has the global symmetries and topological properties of QCD. It is confining in the sense that only color singlets have a nonzero expecta tion value. It is now well understood that fluctuations of low lying eigenvalues of the Dirac operator are described by chRMT see23 28 for lectures and reviews . Philosphically, this is important because of the realization that chaotic motion dom inates the dynamics of quarks at low energy. Practically, this is important because we can use powerful random matrix techniques to calculate physical observables. The condition for the applicability of chRMT is that the Compton wavelength of Goldstone bosons associated with the mass scale z of these eigenvalues is much larger than the size of the box. With the squared mass of the associated Goldstone boson given by 2z F 2 , this condition reads29 2z F 2 1 V 2. The second condition is necessary to factorize the partition function into a contribu tion from the lightest degrees of freedom and all heavier degrees of freedom. These two conditions determine the microscopic domain of QCD. We stress that z is a scale in the Dirac spectrum so that, for sufficiently large volumes, we always have eigenval ues in the domain where eigenvalues fluctuate according to chRMT. This can be shown rigorously from the following two observations.30 ,31 First, the infrared Dirac spectrum follows from a partially quenched chiral Lagrangian

Chunk: determined by chiral symmetry, and the inequality is the condition for factorization of the partition function into a factor containing the constant modes and another factor containing the nonzero momentum modes. Second, the factor with the constant modes is equal to the large N limit of chiral random matrix theory. In32 ,33 the condition was imposed on the quark masses and was the bases for a systematic expansion of the chiral Lagrangian known as the o expansion. One feature that underlies universal properties of eigenvalues is that they be have as repulsive confined charges. This follows from the joint probability distri bution Q k k Q 2 k 2 l 2 exp N P k 2 k . It can be shown that eigenvalues correlations at the micrsocopic scale are universal.34 The reason is spontaneous symmetry breaking and a mass gap so that they can be described in terms of a chiral Lagrangian. 2.1. Chiral Random Matrix Theory at 0 and T 0 A nonzero temperature does not change the fluctuating behavior of the Dirac eigenvalues provided that chiral symmetry remains broken. However, a transition to a different universality class takes place at the critical temperature. A random matrix model that reproduces this universal behavior of QCD is obtained by replacing the off diagonal elements in by35 iW iW t, iW iW t with T, T . This model has been studied elaborately in the literature see e.g.35 40 . A nonzero chemical potential can be introduced analogously to the quark mass.

A random matrix model that has had a strong impact on recent developments is defined by42 iW iW H, iW iW H with H H, where H is drawn from a Gaussian ensemble of random matrices. This model is in the same universality class as but is technically simpler since it can be worked out by means of the complex orthogonal polynomial method.42 46 There are other types of random matrix models that have been applied to QCD. For example models with random gauge fields such as the Eguchi Kawai model47 or its 2 dimensional version.48 QCD in 1 dimension49 ,50 is a random matrix model as well, with universally fluctuating Dirac eigenvalues. Also models with random Wilson loops51 ,52 have attracted significant interest. 3. Phases of QCD and RMT QCD like theories with charged Goldstone bosons have a critical chemical poten tial equal to m 2. The phase transition to the Bose condensed phase can therefore be described completely in terms of a chiral Lagragian. At the mean field level,53 the kinetic terms of this chiral Lagrangian do not contribute, so that these results can also be obtained from chiral random matrix theory. Indeed, the static part of the chiral Lagrangian53 ,54 2Tr U, B U , B 1 2 Tr MU MU . can also be obtained from the large N limit of the models or . 4 K.Splittorffand J.J.M.

Schematic RMT Phase Diagram The phase transition in QCD with quark masses and chemical potentials m u and m d is driven by the competition between the chiral symmetry breaking scale , associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, and the scale , associated with the explicit breaking of this symmetry by the quark masses and chemical potentials.59 The competition between these scales leads to a rich variety of phase structure.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0332v4 gr qc 10 Oct 2007 The effect of a fifth large scale space time dimension on the conservation of energy in a four dimensional Universe M B Gerrard and T J Sumner Department of Physics, Imperial College London, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BW, UK E mail Michael.Gerrard partnershipsuk.org.uk, t.sumner imperial.ac.uk Abstract. The effect of introducing a fifth large scale space time dimension to the equations of orbital dynamics was analysed in an earlier paper by the authors. The results showed good agreement with the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies and the Pioneer Anomaly. This analysis did not require the modification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a five dimensional framework. The same analysis derived an acceleration parameter ar, which plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics, and suggested a value for ar. In this companion paper, the principle of conservation of energy is restated within the same five dimensional framework. The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value of ar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely on key cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitational constant, G. The same analysis suggests that i the inverse square law of gravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary between a four dimensional universe and a fifth large scale space time dimension and ii there is a limiting case for the Tulley Fisher relationship linking the speed of light to the mass of the universe. PACS numbers 04.50 h Conservation of energy with 5 dimensions 2 1. Introduction In an earlier paper we introduced a fifth large scale space time dimension, r to Newton s Second Law, as applied to systems with angular velocity. The resulting analysis of the orbital motion of galaxies, which considered only the role of baryonic matter, is consistent with their observed rotation curves and the Tulley Fisher relationship. The dimension r, is orthogonal to the three space dimensions s x, y, z and the time dimension, t of a four dimensional universe, but does not represent a degree of freedom of motion in this analysis. For a closed isotropic universe, r is the radius of curvature of four dimensional space time and has a value, ru remote from gravitating matter that is estimated to be 7.5 1026 m. The parameter ar is derived from the relationship . In the case of r being equal to ru, ar has a value of 1.2 10 10 ms 2, which is the same as the MOND parameter a0 derived by Milgrom from observing the rotation curves of more than eighty galaxies. Using the same five dimensional analytical framework, this paper examines the relationships between ar, the principle of conservation of energy and gravity. The resulting derivation of ar is, therefore, unrelated to orbital dynamics and Newton s Second Law and instead relies on key cosmological constants, such as the gravitational constant, G and parameters, such as the mass density of the universe. 2. Background Gravitational Acceleration in the Universe The large scale distribution of matter across the universe creates a background gravitational acceleration, gb which is isotropic if matter itself is evenly distributed on this scale. The mutual attraction of each particle of matter towards all other matter, as represented by gb, is similar in concept to a three dimensional surface tension stretching across the universe. If space is assumed to be flat and open and matter is assumed to be evenly distributed on this large scale, with baryonic mass density , then the background gravitational acceleration, gb, can be derived as follows G HH where G is the gravitational constant 6.67 10 11 m3Kg 1s 2 , for baryonic matter has a currently estimated value 10 28 Kg m 3 and HH is the Hubble Horizon given by s Constant 71 Km s 1Mpc 1 .

Chunk: Substitution in equation gives a current value for gb of 8.2 10 12 ms 2 which is noted to be two orders of magnitude less than the value of a0. The accuracy of equation depends on three potential sources of uncertainty, namely the value of , the method of calculation of the volume of the universe within the Hubble Horizon and the value of H itself. These will be discussed later. Conservation of energy with 5 dimensions 3 M ru gx ar r x Figure 1. Locus of points r x at which there is balance between the two accelerations gx and ar. 3. Background Radius of Curvature of the Universe In section 3.2 of the earlier paper an expression was derived for the locus of points r x adjacent to a gravitating mass, M which defined the balance condition between gravitational acceleration gx and the acceleration ar acting everywhere in the universe in the direction of r. r x ru 1 GM c2x where ru is the radius of curvature of four dimensional space time remote from gravitating matter M and x is the distance away from M as shown in figure 1. The effect which matter has on the local radius of curvature of space time, r is cumulative and can be found by the superposition r ri ru, where ru ri from all individual masses, Mi. Applying equation to all baryonic matter contained within the Hubble Horizon again assumed to be evenly distributed across space with density and lying within a spherical volume defined by 4 3 s3 where s here is HH it is possible to calculate an overall background value of r x . This value will inevitably be somewhat less than ru given that no point is, in practice, completely remote from all matter. This background value of r is referred to as rb and is derived by integrating the contributions from matter lying within concentric spherical shells of space to give G H2 H c2 ! Substituting for known parameters and constants in equation , including the current value of the mass density u, gives a value for rb equal to 0.98 ru. Substituting either value for r into the key relationship , namely 1.2 10 10 ms 2. The average mass density of the universe, , decreases over time in an expanding universe. For a Euclidean although expanding universe, the volume of space within Conservation of energy with 5 dimensions 4 the Hubble Horizon is given by 4 3 H3 H 4 3 ct 3. Given that to a first order the total mass lying within the Hubble Horizon is constant, it follows that we can derive an expression for the average mass density t of the universe at any time t, in terms of the average mass density observed for the current era u i.e. 3 10 28 Kg m 3 and the current estimated age of the universe tu i.e. 13.7 Bn years . ut3 u t3 Given that this equation is derived in part from the approximation HH ct, it is assumed only to be applicable in the current analysis for perturbations of time about the current era.

Abstract In line with the local philicity concept proposed by Chattaraj et al. Chattaraj, P. K. Maiti, B. Sarkar, U. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2003, 107, 4973 and a dual descriptor derived by Toro Labbe and coworkers Morell, C. Grand, A. Toro Labbe , A. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2005, 109, 205 , we propose a multiphilic descriptor. It is defined as the difference between nucleophilic k and electrophilic k condensed philicity functions. This descriptor is capable of simultaneously explaining the nucleophilicity and electrophilicity of the given atomic sites in the molecule. Variation of these quantities along the path of a soft reaction is also analyzed. Predictive ability of this descriptor has been successfully tested on the selected systems and reactions. Corresponding force profiles are also analyzed in some representative cases. Also, to study the intra and intermolecular reactivities another related descriptor namely, the nucleophilicity excess g for a nucleophile, over the electrophilicity in it has been defined and tested on all metal aromatic compounds. Authors for correspondence E mail subuchem hotmail.com, atola puc.cl, pkc chem.iitkgp.ernet.in, 2 1. Introduction The understanding of chemical reactivity and site selectivity of the molecular systems has been effectively handled by the conceptual density functional theory DFT .1 Chemical potential, global hardness, global softness, electronegativity and electrophilicity are global reactivity descriptors, highly successful in predicting global chemical reactivity trends. Fukui function FF and local softness are extensively applied to probe the local reactivity and site selectivity. The formal definitions of all these descriptors and working equations for their computation have been described. 1 4 Various applications of both global and local reactivity descriptors in the context of chemical reactivity and site selectivity have been reviewed in detail.3 Parr et al. introduced the concept of Electrophilicity as a global reactivity index similar to the chemical hardness and chemical potential. 5 This new reactivity index measures the stabilization in energy when the system acquires an additional electronic charge N from the environment. The electrophilicity is defined as 2 . , I A 2 and I A 2 are the electronic chemical potential and the chemical hardness of the ground state of atoms and molecules, respectively, approximated in terms of the vertical ionization potential I and electron affinity A . The electrophilicity is a descriptor of reactivity that allows a quantitative classification of the global electrophilic nature of a molecule within a relative scale. 5 Fukui Function FF 6 is one of the widely used local density functional descriptors to model chemical reactivity and site selectivity and is defined as the derivative of the 3 electron density rG with respect to the total number of electrons N in the system, at constant external potential rG acting on an electron due to all the nuclei in the system r v N N r r v r f G G G . The condensed FF are calculated using the procedure proposed by Yang and Mortier,7 based on a finite difference method 1 N q N q , - 1 N q , FF i = - ( G N q + 1 G N q , where i denotes the sites i in the system and q N q is the difference in the number of electrons between the neutral and the corresponding charged state of the system. The FF are expressed in atomic form when they are distributed over the atomic sites of the molecule. The atomic FF are used to predict the chemical reactivity and site selectivity in chemical reactions. The global softness S and the local softness S i , i are the inverse of the global hardness E and the local hardness H i , i respectively, in the following expressions 2 . , 1 H = 12 ( I + A ) and 1 H i = 12 ( I i + A i ) , where I I i and A A i are the ionization potential and electron affinity of the subsystem and the atomic sites i in the system, respectively. The Fukui function is a local descriptor of nucleophilic, electrophilic and radical character of the atomic sites in the system.

Chunk: information about hitherto known different global and local reactivity and selectivity descriptors, in addition to the information regarding electrophilic nucleophilic power of a given atomic site in a molecule. It is possible to define a local quantity called philicity associated with a site k in a molecule with the help of the corresponding condensed to atom variants of FF, kf as k k , and 0 represents local philic quantities describing nucleophilic, electrophilic and radical attacks respectively. Eq. predicts that the most electrophilic site in a molecule is the one providing the maximum value of k . When two molecules react, which one will act as an electrophile nucleophile will depend on, which has a higher lower electrophilicity index. This global trend originates from the local behavior of the molecules or precisely at the atomic site s that is are prone to electrophilic 4 nucleophilic attack. Recently the usefulness of electrophilicity index in elucidating the toxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls, benzidine and chlorophenol has been assessed in detail. 9 11 In addition to the knowledge of global softness S , which is the inverse of hardness, 12 different local softnesses 13 used to describe the reactivity of atoms in molecule, can be defined as k k s Sf where , and 0 represents local softness quantities describing nucleophilic, electrophilic and radical attacks respectively. Based on local softness, relative nucleophilicity sk sk and relative electrophilicity sk sk indices have also been defined and their usefulness to predict reactive sites also been addressed to.14 It has been established that the quantum chemical model selected to derive wave function population scheme used to obtain the partial charges and basis set employed in the molecular orbital calculations are important parameters, which significantly influence the FF values. 15 18 The condensed philicity summed over a group of relevant atoms is defined as the group philicity . It can be expressed n k k g 1 where n is the number of atoms coordinated to the reactive atom, k is the local electrophilicity of the atom k, and g is the group philicity obtained by adding the local philicity of the nearby bonded atoms. In this study19 the group nucleophilicity index g of the selected systems is used to compare the chemical reactivity trends. 5 Toro Labbe et al20 have recently proposed a dual descriptor f r , which is defined as the difference between the nucleophilic and electrophilic Fukui functions and is given by, f r f r f r If f r 0, then the site is favored for a nucleophilic attack, whereas if f r 0, then the site may be favored for an electrophilic attack. The associated dual local softness have also been defined as,19 fk fk sk sk It is defined as the condensed version of f r multiplied by the molecular softness S. 2. Multiphilic Descriptor In the light of the local philicity concept proposed by Chattaraj et al.8 and the dual descriptor derived by Toro Labbe and coworkers,20 we propose a multiphilic descriptor using the unified philicity concept, which can concurrently characterize both nucleophilic and electrophilic nature of a chemical species. It is defined as the difference between the nucleophilic and electrophilic condensed philicity functions. It is an index of selectivity towards nucleophilic attack, which can as well characterize an electrophilic attack and is given by,21 k k k 6 where k is the condensed to atom variant k of r eq 7 . If , then the site k is favored for a nucleophilic attack, whereas if , then the site k may be favored for an electrophilic attack. Because FFs are positive , , and the normalization condition for k is k k k k f Although k and fk will contain the same intramolecular reactivity information the former is expected to be a better intermolecular descriptor because of its global information content. We may analyze the nature

Chunk: existence of a time discretization scheme X k k 0 such that holds for the class of bounded continuous functions. The aim of this paper is then to inves tigate the convergence properties of a functional version of the sequence n ,d n 1. Let Xt be a Markov and Feller process and let Xt t 0 be a stepwise constant time discretization scheme of Xt with non increasing step sequence n n 1 satisfying lim n , n n X k n .

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0336v2 cond mat.mes hall 20 Aug 2007 Influence of Phonon dimensionality on Electron Energy Relaxation J. T. Karvonen and I. J. Maasilta Nanoscience Center, Department of Physics, P.O. Box 35, FIN 40014 University of Jyv askyl a, Finland. We studied experimentally the role of phonon dimensionality on electron phonon e p interaction in thin copper wires evaporated either on suspended silicon nitride membranes or on bulk substrates, at sub Kelvin temperatures. The power emitted from electrons to phonons was measured using sensitive normal metal insulator superconductor NIS tunnel junction thermometers. Membrane thicknesses ranging from 30 nm to 750 nm were used to clearly see the onset of the effects of two dimensional 2D phonon system. We observed for the first time that a 2D phonon spectrum clearly changes the temperature dependence and strength of the e p scattering rate, with the interaction becoming stronger at the lowest temperatures below 0.5 K for the 30 nm membranes. PACS numbers 63.22. m, 63.20.Kr, 85.85. j It is an established fact that at sub Kelvin tempera tures the thermal coupling between conduction electrons and the lattice becomes very weak . This has signifi cant implications for the operation of low temperature detectors and coolers , or for any solid state sys tems where dissipation and cooling are relevant. Low temperature electron phonon e p interaction has been studied widely during the past decades, but mostly only for the case in which the phonons are fully three di mensional 3D . However, due to signifi cant advances in fabrication of thin suspended structures, many practical devices and detectors exist in which the phonons are expected to move freely only within the plane of a membrane, forming a quasi 2D system . The question how the two dimensionality of the phonon modes influences e p interaction has been addressed the oretically for certain cases , but no clear exper imental observation of the effect has been reported to date, although several attempts have been made . In this paper, we show for the first time experimen tally that the electron phonon interaction clearly changes depending on the dimensionality of the phonons, as ex pected from theory. E p coupling was measured with the help of sensitive NIS tunnel junction thermometry , for thin Cu wires on suspended silicon nitride SiNx membranes with thickness varying from 30 nm to 750 nm, which spans the transition from 2D to 3D phonons. In addition, samples with identical Cu wires on bulk substrates were also measured for comparison. For the thinnest membranes, the e p interaction was strengthened in comparison with the bulk samples, and its tempera ture dependence changed significantly, as is predicted by the theory . The change was large enough to give indirect evidence that the dispersive k2 , flex ural modes of the membrane likely play a major role in the e p interaction. In the presence of stress free boundaries, the bulk transversal and longitudinal phonon modes with sound velocities ct and cl, respectively couple to each other and form a new set of eigenmodes, which in the case of a suspended membrane are known as the horizontal shear modes h , and symmetric s and antisymmet ric a Lamb modes . The frequencies for the h modes are simply ct q k2 m d 2, where k is the wave vector component parallel to the membrane sur faces, d is the membrane thickness and the integer m is the branch number. However, the dispersion relations of the s and a Lamb modes cannot be given in a closed an alytical form, but have to be calculated numerically. The lowest three branches, dominant for thin membranes at low temperatures, have low frequency analytical expres sions , , and 2m k2 , where c2 l c2 t c2 l is the effective sound velocity of the s mode, and h 2ctd p c2 l

Chunk: c2 t 3c2 l i 1 is an effective mass for the a mode particle . This lowest a mode with its quadratic dispersion is mostly responsible for the non trivial behavior of the e p interaction . Note that already a single free surface affects the modes and the e p interaction , as the bulk modes cou ple and form another new set of eigenstates, including the surface localized Rayleigh mode. Thus, the widely observed result for e p power flow V T 5 e T 5 p from a metal volume V with Te the electron and Tp the phonon temperature, is not expected to hold even for thin enough films on bulk substrates. A schematic of the Cu wire samples on suspended sil icon nitride membranes and the used measuring circuit is shown in Fig. 1. 17 samples were made on either sus pended membranes or bulk substrates, where nitridized Si wafers with 30, 200 and 750 nm thick low stress SiNx top layers were used as the substrate for both cases. The suspension of the SiNx membranes size 600 300 m2 was achieved by anisotropic backside wet etching of the silicon substate in KOH, and the metallic structures were fabricated using standard e beam lithography and multi angle shadow mask evaporation techniques. As the e p interaction strength is sensitive to the thickness and disorder level of the metal , we minimized its effect by evaporating the Cu wires of a specific thickness on all the different substrates simultaneously. Ultrathin Cu layers were used to strengthen the effect of the thin membranes. The oxide layer forming the tun nel junction barriers was produced by thermal oxidation of Al. Table I presents the essential dimensions of the 2 samples discussed in this paper, measured by scanning electron SEM and atomic force AFM microscopies. The electron mean free path l was determined from the resistance of the wire at base temperature 60 mK, using the accurately measured dimensions of the wire.

Red lines are the normal metal Cu, light gray Al for SINIS junctions and dark gray Al or Nb for SN junctions. We used the hot electron technique to measure the e p interaction by overheating the electrons by Joule heat power P and measuring the resulting electron tempera ture Te. All the samples had two electrically isolated Cu normal metal wires next to each other Fig. 1 . The longer wire m was heated by applying a slowly ramping voltage across the pair of superconducting Nb or Al leads in direct metallic contact to Cu, forming SN junctions. These junctions provide excellent electri cal, but very poor thermal conductance due to Andreev reflection, as the junctions are biased within the super conducting gap . Thus, due to the lack of thermal contact, the electrons in the m wire obtain a temperature rise ΔT e while the phonons in the m wire are effectively isolated and hence have a negligible temperature rise ΔT p . The shorter wire b was used as a reference with negligible temperature rise ΔT p . The power dissipated in the Cu wire was measured directly by the voltage drop across a low resistance shunt resistor R s located in the series with the wire. The hot electron power flow was then determined from the temperature rise ΔT e , the power dissipated P and the specific resistance of the Cu wire.

Chunk: arXiv 0704.0337v1 math.AP 3 Apr 2007 Bursting Dynamics of the 3D Euler Equations in Cylindrical Domains Fran cois Golse Ecole Polytechnique, CMLS 91128 Palaiseau Cedex, France Alex Mahalov and Basil Nicolaenko Department of Mathematics and Statistics Arizona State University Tempe, AZ 85287 1804, USA Abstract A class of three dimensional initial data characterized by uniformly large vorticity is considered for the 3D incompressible Euler equations in bounded cylindrical domains. The fast singular oscillating limits of the 3D Euler equations are investigated for parametrically resonant cylin ders. Resonances of fast oscillating swirling Beltrami waves deplete the Euler nonlinearity. These waves are exact solutions of the 3D Euler equations. We construct the 3D resonant Euler systems the latter are countable uncoupled and coupled SO 3 C and SO 3 R rigid body systems. They conserve both energy and helicity. The 3D resonant Eu ler systems are vested with bursting dynamics, where the ratio of the enstrophy at time 0 of some remarkable orbits becomes very large for very small times t similarly for higher norms Hs, s 2. These orbits are topologically close to homoclinic cycles. For the time intervals where Hs norms, s 7 2 of the limit resonant orbits do not blow up, we prove that the full 3D Euler equa tions possess smooth solutions close to the resonant orbits uniformly in strong norms.

The Cauchy problem in 3D bounded axisymmetric cylindrical domains is attracting considerable attention with bounded, smooth, non axisymmetric 3D initial data, under the constraints of conservation of bounded energy, can the vorticity field blow up in finite time? Outstanding numeri cal claims for this have recently been disproven Ke , Hou1 , Hou2 . The classical analytical criterion of Beale Kato Majda B K M for non blow up in finite time requires the time integrability of the L norm of the vorticity.

However, these flows are really 2 Dimensional in x1, x2, 3 components flows, independent from the third co ordinate x3. Their examples DiPe Li show that solutions even smooth ones of the 3D Euler equations cannot be estimated in W1,p for on any time interval 0, T if the initial data are only assumed to be bounded in W1,p. Classical local existence theorems in 3D bounded or periodic domains by Kato Ka , Bourguignon Br ezis Bou Br and Yudovich Yu1 , Yu2 require some minimal smoothness for the initial conditions IC , e.g., in Hs D , .

Remark 3.10 Under the conditions of Lemma 3.7, 6 1, whereas 2 Ln 1 1. Therefore, over a small time interval of length O 2 Ln 1 1, the ratio U t H3 U H3 grows up to a maximal value O 3 1. Since the orbit is periodic, the H3 semi norm eventually relaxes to its initial state after some time this being a mani festation of the time reversibility of the Euler flow on the energy sphere . The shadowing theorem 2.10 with , original 3D Eu ler dynamics, with the same initial conditions, will undergo the same type of burst. Notice that, with the definition of Hs, one has e3 y curl3 e3 y . Hence the solid rotation part of the original 3D Euler solution does not con tribute to the ratio V t H3 V H3. Theorem 3.11 Bursting dynamics of the enstrophy .

Then there exists , such that t 2 where t 1 2 1 Ln 1 . 18 Remark 3.12 It is interesting to compare this mechanism for bursts with ear lier results in the same direction obtained by DiPerna and Lions. Indeed, for each p 1, , each 0, 1 and each , Di Perna and Lions DiPe Li constructed examples of 2D 3 components solutions to Euler equations such that V W 1,p o while V t W 1,p 1 . Their examples essentially correspond to shear flows of the form V t, x1, x2 u x2 0 w x1 tu x2 , x2 where u W 1,p x2 while w W 1,p x2 . Obviously curlV t, x1, x2 2 tu x2 1 w x1 tu x2 , x2 1w x1 tu x2 , x2 u x2 Thus, all components in curlV t, x1, x2 belong to Lp loc, except for the term tu x2 1w x1 tu x2 , x2 . For each , this term belongs to Lp for all choices of the functions u W 1,p x2 and w W 1,p x1,x2 if and only if . Whenever , DiPerna and Lions construct their examples as some smooth approximation of the situation above in the strong W 1,p topology. In other words, the DiPerna Lions construction works only in cases where the initial vorticity does not belong to an algebra specifically to Lp, which is not an algebra unless . The type of burst obtained in our construction above is different in that case, the original vorticity belongs to the Sobolev space H2, which is an algebra in space dimension 3. Similar phenomena are observed in all Sobolev spaces H with 2 which are also algebras in space dimension 3. In other words, our results complement those of DiPerna Lions on bursts in higher order Sobolev spaces, however at the expense of using more intricate dynamics.

Chunk: the very high nanofriction coefficient measured on the MoDTC tribofilm under the present testing conditions and those published values. As, regarding the literature, the formation of MoS2 was well established for MoDTC containing lubricants, the question is how can we explain such high friction coefficient during the nanofriction tests ? Or what caused the very low friction observed when ZDTP was used together with MoDTC ? From figure 10, the low friction coefficient values 0.01 0.05 were observed for the MoDTC containing lubricants when the contact pressure was in the range 1.5 3 GPa the question of the spatial heterogeneity of the ZDTP MoDTC tribofilm will be discussed latter . These high pressures were measured for tribofilms able to increase their mechanical properties, thus accommodating the contact conditions, which was demonstrated to be the case for ZDTP anti wear tribofilms . On the other hand, high pressures were not reached for the soft MoDTC tribofilm. Thus, the easy sliding of the MoS2 sheets could result from a favourable orientation induced by sufficiently high contact pressure values. The ability of MoS2 sheets to orient in a favourable direction was reported by Grossiord et al. and Martin et al. , who recently investigated tribochemical interactions between ZDTP, MoDTC and OCB overbased detergent calcium borate additives. Using high resolution TEM observations of wear debris, coupled with wear scar micro spot XPS analysis, they observed perfectly oriented MoS2 sheets, with their basal plane parallel to the flaky wear fragments. Such mechanical interpretation of the role of the contact pressure agrees with previous work of Muraki et al. who studied the effect of roller hardness on the rolling sliding characteristics of MoDTC in the presence of ZDTP and concluded that the friction reduction effect increased with higher degree of roller hardness . Yamamoto also reported that a necessary condition for improving the friction and wear characteristics of a lubricant was the formation of surface films composed of iron phosphates with high hardness and Mo S compounds . Concerning the spatial heterogeneity of the ZDTP MoDTC tribofilms, it can be worth noting that using high resolution TEM observations of wear debris collected after friction tests, coupled with AES and XPS studies of rubbing surfaces, Grossiord et al. described the ZDTP MoDTC tribofilm as being composed of a mixture of glassy zinc phosphate zones containing molybdenum, and carbon rich zones containing zinc and highly dispersed MoS2 single sheets . The observation that, during the nanofriction tests, the low friction domain was located a few nanometers below the surface also corroborates this interpretation. As the nanofriction tests were conducted at increasing depth, the sufficiently high pressures were obtained after a few 15 nanometers penetration depth inside the MoS2 containing layer with properties similar to the MoDTC tribofilm , thanks to the presence of the underneath resisting anti wear layer, whose characteristics are similar to those of the phosphate layer of the ZDTP tribofilm. Finally, combining the results obtained from the nanoindentation and nanofriction experiments, we can propose a possible schematic description of the anti wear tribofilms obtained from the full formulation oil. Some assumptions are also made on what happened during nanofriction tests on such tribofilms see figure 12 on which for convenient drawing, as the Berkovitch diamond tip is not sharp, it was represented by a flat punch . A soft layer containing non oriented MoS2 sheets is present at the surface of the tribofilm layer a in figure 12 . This layer, 0 to 25 nm thick, has mechanical properties comparable with those of the MoDTC tribofilm 0.3 0.5 GPa for the hardness and 3 10 GPa for the reduced Young s modulus . Its friction coefficient is rather high. This layer is easily damaged or removed by the diamond tip during imaging or line scanning procedures. When the contact pressure is sufficiently high, friction induces a favourable orientation of the MoS2 sheets, over a thickness

Conclusions Thanks to the combined used of i nanoindentation experiments with continuous stiffness measurements coupled with imaging procedures, ii a specifically developed rheological film model and iii nanofriction tests, synergistic effects of ZDTP and MoDTC on frictional behaviour of anti wear tribofilms have been evidenced from mechanical considerations. One original feature of this study lies in the characterisation of unwashed anti wear tribofilms with their full structure preserved. The structure and nanomechanical properties hardness and reduced Young s modulus of tribofilms formed with different mixtures of additives ZDTP, MoDTC, detergent dispersant were first determined. Concerning the occurrence of very low friction 0.01 0.05 , the contact pressure was found to be a critical parameter. The low friction coefficient values were attributed to a favourable orientation of MoS2 sheets present in the outer layer of the tribofilms formed from MoDTC containing lubricants. Such a favourable orientation occurred only if sufficiently high contact pressure was reached. These high contact pressures were attained when ZDTP was used as oil additive together with MoDTC because one of the main characteristics of ZDTP additives is to form protective anti wear tribofilms under boundary lubrication, with varying structure and properties with depth, among which is an amazing ability to increase their mechanical properties, thus accommodating the contact conditions. A possible schematic description of the tribofilms containing both ZDTP and MoDTC was deduced and a mechanism was proposed to account for the mechanical synergy that occurs during nanofriction tests on such tribofilms.

Chunk: Plastic depth nm Hardness GPa Prior to any contact After imaging test A After imaging test B After imaging test C After imaging test D After imaging test E Figure 6 Representative hardness curves obtained on the unwashed ZDTP MoDTC tribofilm, prior to any contact and after the imaging procedure. The film is spatially heterogeneous in thickness and in mechanical properties. ZDTP MoDTC detergent dispersant tribofilms full formulation tribofilms Nanoindentation tests performed in fresh areas, prior to any contact showed that, at the surface of the unwashed tribofilm, there was a very soft layer, mobile under the diamond tip, with an apparent thickness of a few hundreds of nanometers. 10 Representative hardness curves obtained on the unwashed block near these initial contacts are shown figure 7. Contrary to the ZDTP MoDTC tribofilm, the film was found to be spatially homogeneous. Only its thickness was found to vary, depending on the tested area. A very thin softer layer was detected at the surface of the tribofilm, which did not resist to imaging nor scanning, except if the normal load was very low lower than 0.3 N . This layer had a hardness value about 0.3 0.4 GPa comparable to the hardness value of the MoDTC tribofilm. The observed large hardness increase when the load increased also indicated that the tribofilm had a great capability to accommodate the applied pressure. This result was confirmed by the interpretation of the stiffness measurements using the rheological model, which also showed that the tribofilm had a complex structure. At its surface, there was first a layer with a thickness of only a few nanometers 2 nm to 7 nm and a reduced Young s modulus of 10 15 GPa. Then, there was a second layer thickness between 20 nm and 140 nm with a higher reduced Young modulus of 65 80 GPa. A similar tribofilm was tested after n heptane washing. It also had a great ability to accommodate the applied pressure. From the stiffness measurements, on most places, the film was found to behave like a film constituted by two layers. The surface layer was thin 5 to 25 nm with a reduced Young s modulus value in the range 15 20 GPa. The thickness of the underlayer was found to vary between 0 no underlayer, example of figures 1 and 2 and 100 nanometers and its elastic modulus was in the range 110 120 GPa.

Chunk: Eq. can be directly recovered by introducing appropriate asymptotic orderings for the contributions appearing in the source term . Direct inspec tion shows that these are provided by the dimensional parameters M eff p,a 1 c2 p t , M eff p,b 1 c p , M eff V 1 c 2V . The first two M eff p,a and M eff p,b are here denoted respec tively as first and second pressure effective Mach num bers, driven respectively by the pressure time derivative and by the divergence of the pressure anisotropy p1. Furthermore, M eff V is denoted as velocity effective Mach number. Physically relevant examples of asymptotic LBM s can be achieved by introducing suitable orderings in terms of the single infinitesimal for the parameters M eff p,a , M eff p,b and M eff V . We stress that these orderings, in principle, can be introduced without actually introducing restrictions on the fluid fields, i.e., retaining the assump tion that the extended fluid fields are independent of . Interesting cases are provided by the asymptotic order ings indicated below. 7A Small effective Mach numbers M eff p,a , M eff p,b and M eff V An important aspect of LB theory is the possibility of constructing asymptotic LBM s with prescribed accu racy with respect to the infinitesimal parameter , in the sense that the fluid equations are satisfied at least cor rect up to terms of order o n included, with , namely ignoring error terms of order o n 1 or higher. Let us, first, consider the case in which all pa rameters M eff p,a , M eff p,b and M eff V are all infinitesimal w.r. to low effective Mach numbers . Since the parameters c and c are free, they can be defined so that that there results c c 1 o which implies 1 . This requires M eff p,a M eff p,b o 2 . If, we consider a low viscosity fluid for which the kine matic viscosity o can be assumed of order and hence 1 it follows that M eff V o 2 . Thanks to the assumptions there follows p o and 2V o ,which implies that the source term eSi, ignoring corrections of order o 2 , becomes 1 o , eSAi wi c2 ai f. 13 It is immediate to determine the corresponding moment equations, which read 1 c2 p1 t , 2 , Formally the first equation can be interpreted as an evo lution equation for the kinetic pressure p1. Nevertheless, in view of the ordering it actually implies the iso choricity condition 2 . Instead, the second one Eq. . due to the asymp totic approximation , reduces to the Euler equation. Therefore in this case the asymptotic approximation is not adequate. To recover the correct Navier Stokes equation a more accurate approximation is needed, real ized requiring that the hydrodynamic equations are sat isfied correct to order o 3 . A fist possibility is to con sider a more accurate approximation for the source term. Restoring the pressure and viscous source terms in there results the asymptotic source term eSBi wi c2 p1 t ai f1 2V , where in validity of the previous orderings 1 o . The corresponding moment equations become therefore , 3 . It is remarkable that in this case the isochoricity condi tion is exactly fulfilled, even if the source term is not the exact one. For the sake of reference, it is interesting to mention another possible small Mach number ordering. This is obtained imposing for the parameters c and c c 1 o , c 1 o 2 , while requiring for o the same constraint adopted by asymptotic LBM s, namely Eq. . In this case one can show that the moment equation is actually satis fied correct to order o 3 , while

Chunk: must hold also arbitrarily close to the boundary of the fluid domain and with the prescription of the initial and Dirichlet bound ary conditions set for the fluid fields. Remarkably, both the choice of the initial and equilibrium kinetic distri bution functions and their functional class remain essen tially arbitrary. In other words, provided suitable min imal smoothness conditions are met by the kinetic dis tributions function, for arbitrary initial and boundary kinetic distribution functions, the relevant moment equa tions of the kinetic equation coincide identically with the relevant fluid equations. This includes the possibility of defining a LB IKT in which the kinetic distribution function is not necessarily a Galilean invariant. This arbitrariness is reflected also in the choice of pos sible equilibrium distribution functions, which remain essentially free in our theory, and can be made for exam ple in order to achieve minimal algorithmic complexity. A possible solution corresponds to assume polynomial type kinetic equilibria, as in the traditional asymptotic LBM s. These kinetic equilibria are well known to be non Galilean invariant with respect to arbitrary finite velocity translations. Nevertheless, as discussed in detail in Sec.4, Subsection 4A, although the adoption of Galilei invariant kinetic distributions is in possible, this choice does not represent an obstacle for the formulation of a LB IKT. Actually Galilean invariance need to be fulfilled only by the fluid equations. The same invariance prop erty must be fulfilled only by the moment equations of the LB IKT and not necessarily by the whole LB inverse kinetic equation LB IKE . Another significant development of the theory is the formal introduction of an entropic principle, realized by a constant H theorem, in order to assure the strict pos itivity of the kinetic distribution function in the whole existence domain I. The present entropic principle departs significantly from the literature. Unlike previ ous entropic LBM s it is obtained without imposing any functional constraints on the class of the initial kinetic distribution functions. Namely without demanding the validity of a principle of entropy maximization PEM, in a true functional sense on the form of the distri bution function. Rather, it follows imposing a constraint only on a suitable set of extended fluid fields, in particu lar the kinetic pressure p1 r, t .The latter is uniquely re lated to the actual fluid pressure p r, t via the equation p1 r, t p r, t Po t , with Po t 0 to be denoted as pseudo pressure. The constant H theorem is therefore obtained by suitably prescribing the function Po t and implies the strict positivity. The same prescription as sures that the entropy results maximal with respect in the class of the admissible kinetic pressures, i.e., it satisfies a principle of entropy maximization. Remarkably, since this property is not affected by the particular choice of the kinetic equilibrium, the H theorem applies also in the case of polynomial equilibria. We stress that the choice of the entropy functional remains essentially arbitrary, since no actual physical interpretation can be attached to it. For example, without loss of generality it can always be identified with the Gibbs Shannon entropy. Even pre scribing these additional properties, in principle infinite solutions exist to the problem. Hence, the freedom can be exploited to satisfy further requirements for example, mathematical simplicity, minimal algorithmic complex ity, etc. . Different possible realizations of the theory and comparisons with other CFD approaches are considered. The formulation of the inverse kinetic theory is also use ful in order to determine the precise relationship between the LBM s and previous CFD schemes and in particular to obtain possible improved asymptotic LBM s with pre scribed accuracy. As an application, we intend to con struct asymptotic models which satisfy with prescribed accuracy the required fluid equations INSE and possi bly extend also the range of validity of traditional LBM s. In particular, this permits

Chunk: to obtain asymptotic accuracy estimates of customary LB approaches. The scheme of presentation is as follows. In Sec.2 the INSE problem is recalled and the definition of the extended fluid fields is presented. In Sec. 3 the basic assumptions 4 of previous asymptotic LBM s are recalled. In.Sec.4 and 5 the foundations of the new inverse kinetic theory are laid down and the integral LB inverse kinetic theory is presented, while in Sec. 6 the entropic theorem is proven to hold for the kinetic distribution function for properly defined kinetic pressure. Finally, in Sec.7 various asymp totic approximations are obtained for the inverse kinetic theory and comparisons are introduce with previous LB and CFD methods and in Sec. 8 the main conclusions are drawn. 2 THE INSE PROBLEM A prerequisite for the formulation of an inverse kinetic theory providing a phase space description of a clas sical or quantum fluid is the proper identification of the complete set of fluid equations and of the related fluid fields. For a Newtonian incompressible fluid, referred to an arbitrary inertial reference frame, these are provided by the incompressible Navier Stokes equations INSE for the fluid fields , , r,t o. There are supplemented by the inequalities p r,t 0, . Equations are defined in a open connected set R3 defined as the subset of R3 where r,t 0 with boundary , while Eqs. and apply on its closure . Here the notation is standard. Thus, N is the NS operator NV o D DtV p f 2V, with D the convective derivative, f denotes a suitably smooth volume force density acting on the fluid element and . In particular we shall assume that f can be represented in the form r f1 r,t where we have separated the conservative r and the non conservative f1 parts of the force. Equations are assumed to admit a strong solution in I, with I R a possibly bounded time interval. By assumption are continuous in the closure . Hence if in I, f is at least C 1,0 I , it follows necessarily that must be at least C 2,1 I . In the sequel we shall impose on the initial conditions V r,to Vo r , p r, to po r . Furthermore, for greater mathematical simplicity, here we shall impose Dirichlet boundary conditions on V ,t VW ,t p ,t pW ,t . Eqs. and define the initial boundary value problem associated to the reduced INSE reduced INSE problem . It is important to stress that the previous problem can also formulated in an equivalent way by re placing the fluid pressure p r, t with a function p1 r, t denoted kinetic pressure of the form p1 r, t Po p r, t , where t is prescribed but arbitrary real func tion of time and is at least Po t C I . will be denoted hereon as extended fluid fields and Po t will be denoted as pseudo pressure. 3 ASYMPTOTIC LBM S 3A Basic assumptions As is well known, all LB methods are based on a dis crete kinetic theory, using a so called lattice Boltzmann velocity discretization of phase space LB discretization . This involves the definition of a kinetic distribution func tion f, which can only take the values belonging to a finite discrete set discrete kinetic dis tribution functions . In particular, it is assumed that the functions fi, for , k, are associated to a discrete set of k 1 different velocities . Each ai is an a priori prescribed constant vector spanning the vector space Rn with ,and each fi r, t is represented by a suitably smooth real function which is defined and continuous in I and in particular is at least C k,j I with k 3.
