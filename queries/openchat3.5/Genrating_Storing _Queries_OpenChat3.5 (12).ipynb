C. Final state photon fragmen tation 1. Single photon fr agmentation In addition to the QCD singularities asso iated with initial state radiation des rib ed b y the asymptoti terms in Eqs. and 14 , other singularities arise in the O s pro ess q p1 g p2 p3 p4 q p5 Fig. 1 e when a photon is ollinear to the nal state quark. In this limit, the qg q squared matrix elemen t gro ws as 1 s 5 , when s 5 0 , where s 5 is the squared in v arian t mass of the ollinear q pair. In this limit, the squared matrix elemen t fa tors as M qg q 2 2e2e2 i s 5 P q z M qg q 2 in to the pro du t of the squared matrix elemen t M qg q 2 for the pro du tion of a photon and an in termediate quark, and a splitting fun tion P q z 1 1 z 2 z for fragmen tation of the in termediate quark in to a ollinear q pair.

In this limit, the qg q squared matrix elemen t gro ws as 1 s 5 , when s 5 0 , where s 5 is the squared in v arian t mass of the ollinear q pair. In this limit, the squared matrix elemen t fa tors as M qg q 2 2e2e2 i s 5 P q z M qg q 2 in to the pro du t of the squared matrix elemen t M qg q 2 for the pro du tion of a photon and an in termediate quark, and a splitting fun tion P q z 1 1 z 2 z for fragmen tation of the in termediate quark in to a ollinear q pair. In Eq. 20 z is the ligh t one fra tion of the in termediate quark s momen tum arried b y the fragmen tation photon, and eei is the harge of the in termediate quark.

Therefore, on tributions from the nal state ollinear, or fragmen tation, region are most pronoun ed at small r and relativ ely small QT. 1 A fully onsisten t treatmen t of the initial and nal state singularities w ould require a join t initial and nal state resummation.

In the w ork rep orted here, w e are guided b y our in terest in des ribing the ross se tion for isolate d photons, in whi h the fragmen tation on tributions are largely suppressed.

We describe a new algorithm, the k,l pebble game with colors, and use it to obtain a charac terization of the family of k,l sparse graphs and algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concern ing tree decompositions of graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored pebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu and give a new proof of the Tutte Nash Williams characteri zation of arboricity. We also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the k,l pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between pebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow , Gabow and Westermann and Hendrickson . 1. Introduction and preliminaries The focus of this paper is decompositions of k,l sparse graphs into edge disjoint subgraphs that certify sparsity. We use graph to mean a multigraph, possibly with loops. We say that a graph is k,l sparse if no subset of n vertices spans more than kn ledges in the graph a k,l sparse graph with kn ledges is k,l tight. We call the range k l 2k 1 the upper range of sparse graphs and 0 l k the lower range. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms for finding decompositions that certify sparsity in the upper range of l. Our algorithms also apply in the lower range, which was already ad dressed by . A decomposition certifies the sparsity of a graph if the sparse graphs and graphs admitting the decomposition coincide. Our algorithms are based on a new characterization of sparse graphs, which we call the pebble game with colors. The pebble game with colors is a simple graph construction rule that produces a sparse graph along with a sparsity certifying decomposition. We define and study a canonical class of pebble game constructions, which correspond to previously studied decompositions of sparse graphs into edge disjoint trees. Our results provide a unifying framework for all the previously known special cases, including Nash Williams Tutte and . Indeed, in the lower range, canonical pebble game constructions capture the properties of the augmenting paths used in matroid union and intersection algorithms . Since the sparse graphs in the upper range are not known to be unions or intersections of the matroids for which there are efficient augmenting path algorithms, these do not easily apply in Research of both authors funded by the NSF under grants NSF CCF 0430990 and NSF DARPA CARGO CCR 0310661 to the first author. arXiv 0704.0002v2 math.CO 13 Dec 2008 2 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Term Meaning Sparse graph G Every non empty subgraph on n vertices has kn ledges Tight graph G V,E is sparse and V n, E kn l Block H in G G is sparse, and H is a tight subgraph Component H of G G is sparse and H is a maximal block Map graph Graph that admits an out degree exactly one orientation k,l maps and trees Edge disjoint union of ltrees and k l map grpahs lTk Union of ltrees, each vertex is in exactly k of them Set of tree pieces of an lTk induced on V V Pieces of trees in the lTk spanned by E V Proper lTk Every V V contains lpieces of trees from the lTk Table 1.

Now consider the edges reversed in our sequence of moves. As noted above, before we make any of the moves, these sketch out a simple path in H ending at w. Let z be the first vertex on this path in H i. We modify our sequence of moves as follows delete, from the beginning, every move before the one that reverses some edge yz prepend onto what is left a sequence of moves that moves the pebble on w to z in H i. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions 13 a b Fig. 7. Eliminating M2 moves a an M2 move b avoiding the M2 by moving along another path. The path where the pebbles move is indicated by doubled lines. a b Fig. 8. Eliminating M2 moves a the first step to move the black pebble along the doubled path is M2 b avoiding the M2 and simplifying the path. Since no edges change color in the beginning of the new sequence, we have eliminated the M2 move. Because our construction does not change any of the edges involved in the remaining tail of the original sequence, the part of the original path that is left in the new sequence will still be a simple path in H, meeting our initial hypothesis. The rest of the lemma follows by induction. Together Lemma 14 and Lemma 15 prove the following. Lemma 16. If G is a pebble game graph, then G has a canonical pebble game construction. Using canonical pebble game constructions, we can identify the tight pebble game graphs with maps and trees and lTk graphs. 14 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Theorem 3 Main Theorem Lower Range Maps and trees coincide with pebble game graphs . Let 0 l k. A graph G is a tight pebble game graph if and only if G is a k,l maps and trees. Proof. As observed above, a maps and trees decomposition is a special case of the pebble game decomposition. Applying Theorem 2, we see that any maps and trees must be a pebble game graph. For the reverse direction, consider a canonical pebble game construction of a tight graph. From Lemma 8, we see that there are lpebbles left on G at the end of the construction. The definition of the canonical add edge move implies that there must be at least one pebble of each ci for ,2,...,l. It follows that there is exactly one of each of these colors. By Lemma 12, each of these pebbles is the root of a monochromatic tree piece with n 1 edges, yielding the required ledge disjoint spanning trees. Corollary 5 Nash Williams , Tutte , White and Whiteley . Let l k. A graph G is tight if and only if has a k,l maps and trees decomposition. We next consider the decompositions induced by canonical pebble game constructions when l k 1. Theorem 4 Main Theorem Upper Range Proper Trees and trees coincide with peb ble game graphs . Let k l 2k 1. A graph G is a tight pebble game graph if and only if it is a proper lTk with kn ledges. Proof. As observed above, a proper lTk decomposition must be sparse. What we need to show is that a canonical pebble game construction of a tight graph produces a proper lTk . By Theorem 2 and Lemma 16, we already have the condition on tree pieces and the decom position into ledge disjoint trees. Finally, an application of I4 , shows that every vertex must in in exactly k of the trees, as required. Corollary 6 Crapo , Haas . Let k l 2k 1. A graph\n",

      "Chunk: G is tight if and only if it is a proper lTk . 8. Pebble game algorithms for finding decompositions A na ve implementation of the constructions in the previous section leads to an algorithm re quiring n2 time to collect each pebble in a canonical construction in the worst case n applications of the construction in Lemma 15 requiring n time each, giving a total running time of n3 for the decomposition problem. In this section, we describe algorithms for the decomposition problem that run in time O n2 . We begin with the overall structure of the algorithm. Algorithm 17 The canonical pebble game with colors . Input A graph G. Output A pebble game graph H. Method Set V H V G and place one pebble of each color on the vertices of H. For each edge vw E G try to collect at least l 1 pebbles on v and w using pebble slide moves as described by Lemma 15. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions 15 If at least l 1 pebbles can be collected, add vw to H using an add edge move as in Lemma 14, otherwise discard vw. Finally, return H, and the locations of the pebbles. Correctness. Theorem 1 and the result from that the sparse graphs are the independent sets of a matroid show that H is a maximum sized sparse subgraph of G. Since the construction found is canonical, the main theorem shows that the coloring of the edges in H gives a maps and trees or proper lTk decomposition. Complexity. We start by observing that the running time of Algorithm 17 is the time taken to process O n edges added to H and O m edges not added to H. We first consider the cost of an edge of G that is added to H. Each of the pebble game moves can be implemented in constant time. What remains is to describe an efficient way to find and move the pebbles. We use the following algorithm as a subroutine of Algorithm 17 to do this. Algorithm 18 Finding a canonical path to a pebble. . Input Vertices v and w, and a pebble game configuration on a directed graph H. Output If a pebble was found, yes , and no otherwise. The configuration of H is updated. Method Start by doing a depth first search from from v in H. If no pebble not on w is found, stop and return no. Otherwise a pebble was found. We now have a path ,e1,...,ep 1, , where the vi are vertices and ei is the edge vivi 1. Let c ei be the color of the pebble on ei. We will use the array c to keep track of the colors of pebbles on vertices and edges after we move them and the array s to sketch out a canonical path from v to u by finding a successor for each edge. Set s u end and set c u to the color of an arbitrary pebble on u. We walk on the path in reverse order vp,ep 1,ep 2,...,e1,v1. For each i, check to see if c vi is set if so, go on to the next i. Otherwise, check to see if c vi 1 c ei . If it is, set s vi ei and set c vi c ei , and go on to the next edge. Otherwise c vi 1 c ei , try to find a monochromatic path in color c vi 1 from vi to vi 1. If a vertex x is encountered for which c x is set, we have a path , f1,x2,..., fq 1, set c xi c fi and s xi fi for ,2,...,q 1. If c x c fq 1 , stop. Otherwise, recursively check that there is not a monochro matic c x path from xq 1\n",

      "Chunk: to x using this same procedure. Finally, slide pebbles along the path from the original endpoints v to u specified by the successor array s v , s s v , ... The correctness of Algorithm 18 comes from the fact that it is implementing the shortcut construction. Efficiency comes from the fact that instead of potentially moving the pebble back and forth, Algorithm 18 pre computes a canonical path crossing each edge of H at most three times once in the initial depth first search, and twice while converting the initial path to a canonical one. It follows that each accepted edges takes O n time, for a total of O n2 time spent processing edges in H. Although we have not discussed this explicity, for the algorithm to be efficient we need to maintain components as in . After each accepted edge, the components of H can be updated in time O n . Finally, the results of show that the rejected edges take an amortized O time each. 16 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Summarizing, we have shown that the canonical pebble game with colors solves the decom position problem in time O n2 . 9. An important special case Rigidity in dimension 2 and slider pinning In this short section we present a new application for the special case of practical importance, , . As discussed in the introduction, Laman s theorem characterizes minimally rigid graphs as the 2,3 tight graphs. In recent work on slider pinning, developed after the current paper was submitted, we introduced the slider pinning model of rigidity . Com binatorially, we model the bar slider frameworks as simple graphs together with some loops placed on their vertices in such a way that there are no more than 2 loops per vertex, one of each color. We characterize the minimally rigid bar slider graphs as graphs that are 1. 2,3 sparse for subgraphs containing no loops. 2. 2,0 tight when loops are included. We call these graphs 2,0,3 graded tight, and they are a special case of the graded sparse graphs studied in our paper . The connection with the pebble games in this paper is the following. Corollary 19 Pebble games and slider pinning . In any 2,3 pebble game graph, if we replace pebbles by loops, we obtain a 2,0,3 graded tight graph. Proof. Follows from invariant I3 of Lemma 7. In , we study a special case of slider pinning where every slider is either vertical or horizontal. We model the sliders as pre colored loops, with the color indicating x or y direction. For this axis parallel slider case, the minimally rigid graphs are characterized by 1. 2,3 sparse for subgraphs containing no loops. 2. Admit a 2 coloring of the edges so that each color is a forest i.e., has no cycles , and each monochromatic tree spans exactly one loop of its color. This also has an interpretation in terms of colored pebble games. Corollary 20 The pebble game with colors and slider pinning . In any canonical 2,3 pebble game with colors graph, if we replace pebbles by loops of the same color, we obtain the graph of a minimally pinned axis parallel bar slider framework. Proof. Follows from Theorem 4, and Lemma 12. 10. Conclusions and open problems We presented a new characterization of k,l sparse graphs, the pebble game with colors, and used it to give an efficient algorithm for finding decompositions of sparse graphs into edge disjoint trees. Our algorithm finds such sparsity certifying decompositions in the upper range and runs in time O n2 , which is as fast as the algorithms for recognizing sparse graphs in the upper range from . We also used the pebble game with colors to describe a new sparsity certifying decomposi tion that applies to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions\n",

      "Chunk: 17 We defined and studied a class of canonical pebble game constructions that correspond to either a maps and trees or proper lTk decomposition. This gives a new proof of the Tutte Nash Williams arboricity theorem and a unified proof of the previously studied decomposition cer tificates of sparsity. Canonical pebble game constructions also show the relationship between the l 1 pebble condition, which applies to the upper range of l, to matroid union augmenting paths, which do not apply in the upper range. Algorithmic consequences and open problems. In , Gabow and Westermann give an O n3 2 algorithm for recognizing sparse graphs in the lower range and extracting sparse subgraphs from dense ones. Their technique is based on efficiently finding matroid union augmenting paths, which extend a maps and trees decomposition. The O n3 2 algorithm uses two subroutines to find augmenting paths cyclic scanning, which finds augmenting paths one at a time, and batch scanning, which finds groups of disjoint augmenting paths. We observe that Algorithm 17 can be used to replace cyclic scanning in Gabow and Wester mann s algorithm without changing the running time. The data structures used in the implemen tation of the pebble game, detailed in are simpler and easier to implement than those used to support cyclic scanning. The two major open algorithmic problems related to the pebble game are then Problem 1. Develop a pebble game algorithm with the properties of batch scanning and obtain an implementable O n3 2 algorithm for the lower range. Problem 2. Extend batch scanning to the l 1 pebble condition and derive an O n3 2 pebble game algorithm for the upper range. In particular, it would be of practical importance to find an implementable O n3 2 algorithm for decompositions into edge disjoint spanning trees.\n",

A sparse graph that has n vertices and exactly kn ledges is called tight. For a graph V,E , and V V, we use the notation span V for the number of edges in the subgraph induced by V . In a directed graph, out V is the number of edges with the tail in V and the head in V V for a subgraph induced by V , we call such an edge an out edge. There are two important types of subgraphs of sparse graphs. A block is a tight subgraph of a sparse graph. A component is a maximal block. Table 1 summarizes the sparse graph terminology used in this paper. 1.2. Sparsity certifying decompositions A k arborescence is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge disjoint spanning trees. Figure 1 a shows an example of a 3 arborescence. The k arborescent graphs are described by the well known theorems of Tutte and Nash Williams as exactly the k,k tight graphs. A map graph is a graph that admits an orientation such that the out degree of each vertex is exactly one. A k map graph is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge disjoint map graphs. Figure 1 b shows an example of a 2 map graphs the edges are oriented in one possible configuration certifying that each color forms a map graph. Map graphs may be equivalently defined see, e.g., as having exactly one cycle per connected component.1 A k,l maps and trees is a graph that admits a decomposition into k ledge disjoint map graphs and lspanning trees. Another characterization of map graphs, which we will use extensively in this paper, is as the 1,0 tight graphs . The k map graphs are evidently k,0 tight, and show that the converse holds as well. 1 Our terminology follows Lov asz in . In the matroid literature map graphs are sometimes known as bases of the bicycle matroid or spanning pseudoforests. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions 3 a c b e d a 1 2 3 4 b c Fig. 1.

The 2 map graph is shown with a certifying orientation. A lTk is a decomposition into ledge disjoint not necessarily spanning trees such that each vertex is in exactly k of them. Figure 2 a shows an example of a 3T2. Given a subgraph G of a lTk graph G, the set of tree pieces in G is the collection of the components of the trees in G induced by G since G is a subgraph each tree may contribute multiple pieces to the set of tree pieces in G . We observe that these tree pieces may come from the same tree or be single vertex empty trees. It is also helpful to note that the definition of a tree piece is relative to a specific subgraph. An lTk decomposition is proper if the set of tree pieces in any subgraph G has size at least l. Figure 2 a shows a graph with a 3T2 decomposition we note that one of the trees is an isolated vertex in the bottom right corner. The subgraph in Figure 2 b has three black tree pieces and one gray tree piece an isolated vertex at the top right corner, and two single edges.

      "Chunk: one. Table 1 contains the decomposition terminology used in this paper. The decomposition problem. We define the decomposition problem for sparse graphs as tak ing a graph as its input and producing as output, a decomposition that can be used to certify spar sity. In this paper, we will study three kinds of outputs maps and trees proper lTk decompositions and the pebble game with colors decomposition, which is defined in the next section. 2. Historical background The well known theorems of Tutte and Nash Williams relate the k,k tight graphs to the existence of decompositions into edge disjoint spanning trees.

Edmonds gave another proof of this result using matroid unions. The equivalence of maps and trees graphs and tight graphs in the lower range is shown using matroid unions in , and matroid augmenting paths are the basis of the algorithms for the lower range of . In rigidity theory a foundational theorem of Laman shows that 2,3 tight Laman graphs correspond to generically minimally rigid bar and joint frameworks in the plane. Tay proved an analogous result for body bar frameworks in any dimension using k,k tight graphs. Rigidity by counts motivated interest in the upper range, and Crapo proved the equivalence of Laman graphs and proper 3T2 graphs. Tay used this condition to give a direct proof of Laman s theorem and generalized the 3T2 condition to all lTk for k l 2k 1. Haas studied lTk decompositions in detail and proved the equivalence of tight graphs and proper lTk graphs for the general upper range. We observe that aside from our new pebble game with colors decomposition, all the combinatorial characterizations of the upper range of sparse graphs, including the counts, have a geometric interpretation . A pebble game algorithm was first proposed in as an elegant alternative to Hendrick son s Laman graph algorithms . Berg and Jordan , provided the formal analysis of the pebble game of and introduced the idea of playing the game on a directed graph. Lee and Streinu generalized the pebble game to the entire range of parameters 0 l 2k 1, and left as an open problem using the pebble game to find sparsity certifying decompositions. 3. The pebble game with colors Our pebble game with colors is a set of rules for constructing graphs indexed by nonnegative integers k and l. We will use the pebble game with colors as the basis of an efficient algorithm for the decomposition problem later in this paper. Since the phrase with colors is necessary only for comparison to , we will omit it in the rest of the paper when the context is clear. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions 5 We now present the pebble game with colors. The game is played by a single player on a fixed finite set of vertices. The player makes a finite sequence of moves a move consists in the addition and or orientation of an edge. At any moment of time, the state of the game is captured by a directed graph H, with colored pebbles on vertices and edges. The edges of H are colored by the pebbles on them. While playing the pebble game all edges are directed, and we use the notation vw to indicate a directed edge from v to w. We describe the pebble game with\n",

Pebbles on vertices are shown as black or gray dots. Edges are colored with the color of the pebble on them. Initialization In the beginning of the pebble game, H has n vertices and no edges. We start by placing k pebbles on each vertex of H, one of each color ci, for ,2,...,k. Add edge with colors Let v and w be vertices with at least l 1 pebbles on them. Assume w.l.o.g. that v has at least one pebble on it. Pick up a pebble from v, add the oriented edge vw to E H and put the pebble picked up from v on the new edge. Figure 3 a shows examples of the add edge move. Pebble slide Let w be a vertex with a pebble p on it, and let vw be an edge in H. Replace vw with wv in E H put the pebble that was on vw on v and put p on wv. Note that the color of an edge can change with a pebble slide move. Figure 3 b shows examples. The convention in these figures, and throughout this paper, is that pebbles on vertices are represented as colored dots, and that edges are shown in the color of the pebble on them. From the definition of the pebble slide move, it is easy to see that a particular pebble is always either on the vertex where it started or on an edge that has this vertex as the tail. However, when making a sequence of pebble slide moves that reverse the orientation of a path in H, it is sometimes convenient to think of this path reversal sequence as bringing a pebble from the end of the path to the beginning. The output of playing the pebble game is its complete configuration. Output At the end of the game, we obtain the directed graph H, along with the location and colors of the pebbles. Observe that since each edge has exactly one pebble on it, the pebble game configuration colors the edges. We say that the underlying undirected graph G of H is constructed by the k,l pebble game or that H is a pebble game graph. Since each edge of H has exactly one pebble on it, the pebble game s configuration partitions the edges of H, and thus G, into k different colors. We call this decomposition of H a pebble game with colors decomposition. Figure 4 a shows an example of a 2,2 tight graph with a pebble game decomposition. Let V,E be pebble game graph with the coloring induced by the pebbles on the edges, and let G be a subgraph of G.

Such a monochromatic subgraph is called a map graph piece of G if it contains a cycle in G and a tree piece of G otherwise. The set of tree pieces of G is the collection of tree pieces induced by G . As with the corresponding definition for lTks, the set of tree pieces is defined relative to a specific sub graph in particular a tree piece may be part of a larger cycle that includes edges not spanned by G . The properties of pebble game decompositions are studied in Section 6, and Theorem 2 shows that each color must be 1,0 sparse. The orientation of the edges in Figure 4 a shows this. For example Figure 4 a shows a 2,2 tight graph with one possible pebble game decom position. The whole graph contains a gray tree piece and a black tree piece that is an isolated vertex. The subgraph in Figure 4 b has a black tree and a gray tree, with the edges of the black tree coming from a cycle in the larger graph. In Figure 4 c , however, the black cycle does not contribute a tree piece. All three tree pieces in this subgraph are single vertex gray trees. In the following discussion, we use the notation peb v for the number of pebbles on v and pebi v to indicate the number of pebbles of colors i on v. Table 2 lists the pebble game notation used in this paper. 4. Our Results We describe our results in this section. The rest of the paper provides the proofs. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions 7 Our first result is a strengthening of the pebble games of to include colors. It says that sparse graphs are exactly pebble game graphs. Recall that from now on, all pebble games discussed in this paper are our pebble game with colors unless noted explicitly. Theorem 1 Sparse graphs and pebble game graphs coincide . A graph G is k,l sparse with 0 l 2k 1 if and only if G is a pebble game graph. Next we consider pebble game decompositions, showing that they are a generalization of proper lTk decompositions that extend to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs. Theorem 2 The pebble game with colors decomposition . A graph G is a pebble game graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge disjoint subgraphs such that each is 1,0 sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ltree pieces of the 1,0 sparse graphs in the decomposition. The 1,0 sparse subgraphs in the statement of Theorem 2 are the colors of the pebbles thus Theorem 2 gives a characterization of the pebble game with colors decompositions obtained by playing the pebble game defined in the previous section. Notice the similarity between the requirement that the set of tree pieces have size at least lin Theorem 2 and the definition of a proper lTk. Our next results show that for any pebble game graph, we can specialize its pebble game construction to generate a decomposition that is a maps and trees or proper lTk . We call these specialized pebble game constructions canonical, and using canonical pebble game construc tions, we obtain new direct proofs of existing arboricity results. We observe Theorem 2 that maps and trees are special cases of the pebble game decompo sition both spanning trees and spanning map graphs are 1,0 sparse, and each of the spanning trees contributes at least one piece of tree to every subgraph. The case of proper lTk graphs is more subtle if each color in a pebble game decomposition is a forest, then we have\n",

These time and space bounds mean that our algorithm can be combined with those of without any change in complexity. 5. Pebble game graphs In this section we prove Theorem 1, a strengthening of results from to the pebble game with colors. Since many of the relevant properties of the pebble game with colors carry over directly from the pebble games of , we refer the reader there for the proofs. We begin by establishing some invariants that hold during the execution of the pebble game. Lemma 7 Pebble game invariants . During the execution of the pebble game, the following invariants are maintained in H I1 There are at least lpebbles on V. I2 For each vertex v, span v out v peb v k. I3 For each V V, span V out V peb V kn . I4 For every vertex v V, outi v pebi v 1. I5 Every maximal path consisting only of edges with color ci ends in either the first vertex with a pebble of color ci or a cycle. Proof. I1 , I2 , and I3 come directly from . I4 This invariant clearly holds at the initialization phase of the pebble game with colors. That add edge and pebble slide moves preserve I4 is clear from inspection. I5 By I4 , a monochromatic path of edges is forced to end only at a vertex with a pebble of the same color on it. If there is no pebble of that color reachable, then the path must eventually visit some vertex twice. From these invariants, we can show that the pebble game constructible graphs are sparse. Lemma 8 Pebble game graphs are sparse . Let H be a graph constructed with the pebble game. Then H is sparse. If there are exactly lpebbles on V H , then H is tight. The main step in proving that every sparse graph is a pebble game graph is the following. Recall that by bringing a pebble to v we mean reorienting H with pebble slide moves to reduce the out degree of v by one. Lemma 9 The l 1 pebble condition .

      "Chunk: w. It follows that any sparse graph has a pebble game construction. Theorem 1 Sparse graphs and pebble game graphs coincide . A graph G is k,l sparse with 0 l 2k 1 if and only if G is a pebble game graph. 6. The pebble game with colors decomposition In this section we prove Theorem 2, which characterizes all pebble game decompositions. We start with the following lemmas about the structure of monochromatic connected components in H, the directed graph maintained during the pebble game. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions 9 Lemma 10 Monochromatic pebble game subgraphs are 1,0 sparse . Let Hi be the sub graph of H induced by edges with pebbles of color ci on them. Then Hi is 1,0 sparse, for ,...,k. Proof. By I4 Hi is a set of edges with out degree at most one for every vertex. Lemma 11 Tree pieces in a pebble game graph . Every subgraph of the directed graph H in a pebble game construction contains at least lmonochromatic tree pieces, and each of these is rooted at either a vertex with a pebble on it or a vertex that is the tail of an out edge. Recall that an out edge from a subgraph H V ,E is an edge vw with v V and vw E . Proof. Let H V ,E be a non empty subgraph of H, and assume without loss of generality that H is induced by V . By I3 , out V peb V l. We will show that each pebble and out edge tail is the root of a tree piece. Consider a vertex v V and a color ci. By I4 there is a unique monochromatic directed path of color ci starting at v. By I5 , if this path ends at a pebble, it does not have a cycle. Similarly, if this path reaches a vertex that is the tail of an out edge also in color ci i.e., if the monochromatic path from v leaves V , then the path cannot have a cycle in H . Since this argument works for any vertex in any color, for each color there is a partitioning of the vertices into those that can reach each pebble, out edge tail, or cycle. It follows that each pebble and out edge tail is the root of a monochromatic tree, as desired. Applied to the whole graph Lemma 11 gives us the following. Lemma 12 Pebbles are the roots of trees . In any pebble game configuration, each pebble of color ci is the root of a possibly empty monochromatic tree piece of color ci. Remark Haas showed in that in a lTk , a subgraph induced by n 2 vertices with m edges has exactly kn m tree pieces in it. Lemma 11 strengthens Haas result by extending it to the lower range and giving a construction that finds the tree pieces, showing the connection between the l 1 pebble condition and the hereditary condition on proper lTk . We conclude our investigation of arbitrary pebble game constructions with a description of the decomposition induced by the pebble game with colors. Theorem 2 The pebble game with colors decomposition . A graph G is a pebble game graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge disjoint subgraphs such that each is 1,0 sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ltree pieces of the 1,0 sparse graphs in the decomposition. Proof. Let G be a pebble game graph. The existence of the k edge disjoint 1,0 sparse sub graphs was shown in Lemma 10, and Lemma 11 proves the condition on subgraphs. For the other direction, we observe that a color ci with ti tree pieces in a given subgraph can span at most n ti edges summing over all the colors shows that a graph with\n",

      "Chunk: a pebble game decomposition must be sparse. Apply Theorem 1 to complete the proof. Remark We observe that a pebble game decomposition for a Laman graph may be read out of the bipartite matching used in Hendrickson s Laman graph extraction algorithm . Indeed, pebble game orientations have a natural correspondence with the bipartite matchings used in . 10 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Maps and trees are a special case of pebble game decompositions for tight graphs if there are no cycles in lof the colors, then the trees rooted at the corresponding lpebbles must be spanning, since they have n 1 edges. Also, if each color forms a forest in an upper range pebble game decomposition, then the tree pieces condition ensures that the pebble game de composition is a proper lTk. In the next section, we show that the pebble game can be specialized to correspond to maps and trees and proper lTk decompositions. 7. Canonical Pebble Game Constructions In this section we prove the main theorems Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 , continuing the inves tigation of decompositions induced by pebble game constructions by studying the case where a minimum number of monochromatic cycles are created. The main idea, captured in Lemma 15 and illustrated in Figure 6, is to avoid creating cycles while collecting pebbles. We show that this is always possible, implying that monochromatic map graphs are created only when we add more than k n 1 edges to some set of n vertices. For the lower range, this implies that every color is a forest. Every decomposition characterization of tight graphs discussed above follows immediately from the main theorem, giving new proofs of the previous results in a unified framework. In the proof, we will use two specializations of the pebble game moves. The first is a modi fication of the add edge move. Canonical add edge When performing an add edge move, cover the new edge with a color that is on both vertices if possible. If not, then take the highest numbered color present. The second is a restriction on which pebble slide moves we allow. Canonical pebble slide A pebble slide move is allowed only when it does not create a monochromatic cycle. We call a pebble game construction that uses only these moves canonical. In this section we will show that every pebble game graph has a canonical pebble game construction Lemma 14 and Lemma 15 and that canonical pebble game constructions correspond to proper lTk and maps and trees decompositions Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 . We begin with a technical lemma that motivates the definition of canonical pebble game constructions. It shows that the situations disallowed by the canonical moves are all the ways for cycles to form in the lowest lcolors. Lemma 13 Monochromatic cycle creation . Let v V have a pebble p of color ci on it and let w be a vertex in the same tree of color ci as v. A monochromatic cycle colored ci is created in exactly one of the following ways M1 The edge vw is added with an add edge move. M2 The edge wv is reversed by a pebble slide move and the pebble p is used to cover the reverse edge vw. Proof. Observe that the preconditions in the statement of the lemma are implied by Lemma 7. By Lemma 12 monochromatic cycles form when the last pebble of color ci is removed from a connected monochromatic subgraph. M1 and M2 are the only ways to do this in a pebble game construction, since the color of an edge only changes when it is inserted the first time or a new pebble is put on it by a pebble slide move.

      "Chunk: A type M1 move creates a cycle by adding a black edge. b A type M2 move creates a cycle with a pebble slide move. The vertices are labeled according to their role in the definition of the moves. Figure 5 a and Figure 5 b show examples of M1 and M2 map graph creation moves, respectively, in a 2,0 pebble game construction. We next show that if a graph has a pebble game construction, then it has a canonical peb ble game construction. This is done in two steps, considering the cases M1 and M2 sepa rately. The proof gives two constructions that implement the canonical add edge and canonical pebble slide moves. Lemma 14 The canonical add edge move . Let G be a graph with a pebble game construc tion. Cycle creation steps of type M1 can be eliminated in colors ci for 1 i l , where l min . Proof. For add edge moves, cover the edge with a color present on both v and w if possible. If this is not possible, then there are l 1 distinct colors present. Use the highest numbered color to cover the new edge. Remark We note that in the upper range, there is always a repeated color, so no canonical add edge moves create cycles in the upper range. The canonical pebble slide move is defined by a global condition. To prove that we obtain the same class of graphs using only canonical pebble slide moves, we need to extend Lemma 9 to only canonical moves. The main step is to show that if there is any sequence of moves that reorients a path from v to w, then there is a sequence of canonical moves that does the same thing. Lemma 15 The canonical pebble slide move . Any sequence of pebble slide moves leading to an add edge move can be replaced with one that has no M2 steps and allows the same add edge move. In other words, if it is possible to collect l 1 pebbles on the ends of an edge to be added, then it is possible to do this without creating any monochromatic cycles. 12 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the construction used in the proof of Lemma 15. We call this the shortcut construction by analogy to matroid union and intersection augmenting paths used in previous work on the lower range. Figure 6 shows the structure of the proof. The shortcut construction removes an M2 step at the beginning of a sequence that reorients a path from v to w with pebble slides. Since one application of the shortcut construction reorients a simple path from a vertex w to w, and a path from v to w is preserved, the shortcut construction can be applied inductively to find the sequence of moves we want. w v a v w b w v w c Fig. 6.

Without loss of generality, we can assume that our sequence of moves reorients a simple path in H, and that the first move the end of the path is M2 .

      "Chunk: The evolution of the Earth Moon system based on the dark matter field fluid model Hongjun Pan Department of Chemistry University of North Texas, Denton, Texas 76203, U. S. A. Abstract The evolution of Earth Moon system is described by the dark matter field fluid model with a non Newtonian approach proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth Moon system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the Moon Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche s limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from Earth Moon system data is 4.39 10 22 s 1m 1. This model predicts that the Mars s rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about 4.38 10 22 rad s 2. Key Words. dark matter, fluid, evolution, Earth, Moon, Mars 1 1. Introduction The popularly accepted theory for the formation of the Earth Moon system is that the Moon was formed from debris of a strong impact by a giant planetesimal with the Earth at the close of the planet forming period Hartmann and Davis 1975 . Since the formation of the Earth Moon system, it has been evolving at all time scale. It is well known that the Moon is receding from us and both the Earth s rotation and Moon s rotation are slowing. The popular theory is that the tidal friction causes all those changes based on the conservation of the angular momentum of the Earth Moon system. The situation becomes complicated in describing the past evolution of the Earth Moon system. Because the Moon is moving away from us and the Earth rotation is slowing, this means that the Moon was closer and the Earth rotation was faster in the past. Creationists argue that based on the tidal friction theory, the tidal friction should be stronger and the recessional rate of the Moon should be greater in the past, the distance of the Moon would quickly fall inside the Roche s limit for earth, 15500 km in which the Moon would be torn apart by gravity in 1 to 2 billion years ago. However, geological evidence indicates that the recession of the Moon in the past was slower than the present rate, i. e., the recession has been accelerating with time. Therefore, it must be concluded that tidal friction was very much less in the remote past than we would deduce on the basis of present day observations Stacey 1977 . This was called geological time scale difficulty or Lunar crisis and is one of the main arguments by creationists against the tidal friction theory Brush 1983 . But we have to consider the case carefully in various aspects. One possible scenario is that the Earth has been undergoing dynamic evolution at all time scale since 2 its inception, the geological and physical conditions such as the continent positions and drifting, the crust, surface temperature fluctuation like the glacial snowball effect, etc at remote past could be substantially different from currently, in which the tidal friction could be much less therefore, the receding rate of the Moon could be slower. Various tidal friction models were proposed in the past to describe the evolution of the Earth Moon system to avoid such difficulty or crisis and put the Moon at quite a comfortable distance from Earth at 4.5 billion years ago Hansen 1982, Kagan and Maslova 1994, Ray et al. 1999, Finch 1981, Slichter 1963 . The tidal friction theories explain that the present rate of tidal dissipation\n",

      "Chunk: is anomalously high because the tidal force is close to a resonance in the response function of ocean Brush 1983 . Kagan gave a detailed review about those tidal friction models Kagan 1997 . Those models are based on many assumptions about geological continental position and drifting and physical conditions in the past, and many parameters such as phase lag angle, multi mode approximation with time dependent frequencies of the resonance modes, etc. have to be introduced and carefully adjusted to make their predictions close to the geological evidence. However, those assumptions and parameters are still challenged, to certain extent, as concoction. The second possible scenario is that another mechanism could dominate the evolution of the Earth Moon system and the role of the tidal friction is not significant. In the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society, University of California at Riverside, the author proposed a dark matter field fluid model Pan 2005 with a non Newtonian approach, the current Moon and Earth data agree with this model very well. This paper will demonstrate that the past evolution of Moon Earth system can be described by the dark matter field fluid model without any assumptions 3 about past geological and physical conditions. Although the subject of the evolution of the Earth Moon system has been extensively studied analytically or numerically, to the author s knowledge, there are no theories similar or equivalent to this model. 2. Invisible matter In modern cosmology, it was proposed that the visible matter in the universe is about 2 10 of the total matter and about 90 98 of total matter is currently invisible which is called dark matter and dark energy, such invisible matter has an anti gravity property to make the universe expanding faster and faster. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, the evolution of the universe should be dominated by the physical mechanism of such invisible matter, such physical mechanism could be far beyond the current Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics, and the Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics could reflect only a corner of the iceberg of the greater physics. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, it should be more reasonable to think that such dominant invisible matter spreads in everywhere of the universe the density of the invisible matter may vary from place to place in other words, all visible matter objects should be surrounded by such invisible matter and the motion of the visible matter objects should be affected by the invisible matter if there are interactions between the visible matter and the invisible matter. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, the size of the particles of the invisible matter should be very small and below the 4 detection limit of the current technology otherwise, it would be detected long time ago with such dominant amount. With such invisible matter in mind, we move to the next section to develop the dark matter field fluid model with non Newtonian approach. For simplicity, all invisible matter dark matter, dark energy and possible other terms is called dark matter here. 3. The dark matter field fluid model In this proposed model, it is assumed that 1. A celestial body rotates and moves in the space, which, for simplicity, is uniformly filled with the dark matter which is in quiescent state relative to the motion of the celestial body. The dark matter possesses a field property and a fluid property it can interact with the celestial body with its fluid and field properties therefore, it can have energy exchange with the celestial body, and affect the motion of the celestial body. 2. The fluid property follows the general principle of fluid mechanics. The dark matter field fluid particles\n",

      "Chunk: may be so small that they can easily permeate into ordinary baryonic matter i. e., ordinary matter objects could be saturated with such dark matter field fluid. Thus, the whole celestial body interacts with the dark matter field fluid, in the manner of a sponge moving thru water. The nature of the field property of the dark matter field fluid is unknown. It is here assumed that the interaction of the field associated with the dark matter field fluid with the celestial body is proportional to the mass of the celestial body. The dark matter field fluid is assumed to have a repulsive force against the gravitational force towards baryonic matter. The nature and mechanism of such repulsive force is unknown. 5 With the assumptions above, one can study how the dark matter field fluid may influence the motion of a celestial body and compare the results with observations. The common shape of celestial bodies is spherical. According to Stokes s law, a rigid non permeable sphere moving through a quiescent fluid with a sufficiently low Reynolds number experiences a resistance force F rv F , r is the radius of the sphere, and is the fluid viscosity constant. The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 1 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. For a rigid sphere moving through the dark matter field fluid, due to the dual properties of the dark matter field fluid and its permeation into the sphere, the force F may not be proportional to the radius of the sphere. Also, F may be proportional to the mass of the sphere due to the field interaction. Therefore, with the combined effects of both fluid and field, the force exerted on the sphere by the dark matter field fluid is assumed to be of the scaled form mv r F where n is a parameter arising from saturation by dark matter field fluid, the r1 n can be viewed as the effective radius with the same unit as r, m is the mass of the sphere, and is the dark matter field fluid constant, which is equivalent to . The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 2 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. The force described by Eq. 2 is velocity dependent and causes negative acceleration. According to Newton s second law of motion, the equation of motion for the sphere is mv r dt dv m Then 6 exp 1 0 vt r v v 6 where v0 is the initial velocity of the sphere. If the sphere revolves around a massive gravitational center, there are three forces in the line between the sphere and the gravitational center the gravitational force, the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force of the dark matter field fluid. The drag force in Eq. 3 reduces the orbital velocity and causes the sphere to move inward to the gravitational center. However, if the sum of the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force is stronger than the gravitational force, then, the sphere will move outward and recede from the gravitational center. This is the case of interest here. If the velocity change in Eq. 3 is sufficiently slow and the repulsive force is small compared to the gravitational force and centripetal acceleration force, then the rate of receding will be accordingly relatively slow. Therefore, the gravitational force and the centripetal acceleration force can be approximately treated in equilibrium at any time. The pseudo equilibrium equation is R mv R GMm 2 , M is the mass of the gravitational center, and R is the radius of the orbit. Inserting v of Eq. 4 into Eq. 5 yields 12 exp 1 2 0 t r v GM R or 12 exp 1 0 t r R R where 2 0 0 v GM . Note that R exponentially increases with time.\n",

      "Chunk: The increase of orbital energy with the receding comes from the repulsive force of dark matter field fluid. The recessional rate of the sphere is R r dt dR The acceleration of the recession is R r dt R d n 2 1 2 2 . The recessional acceleration is positive and proportional to its distance to the gravitational center, so the recession is faster and faster. According to the mechanics of fluids, for a rigid non permeable sphere rotating about its central axis in the quiescent fluid, the torque T exerted by the fluid on the sphere is 3 8 r is the angular velocity of the sphere. The direction of the torque in Eq. 11 is opposite to the direction of the rotation. In the case of a sphere rotating in the quiescent dark matter field fluid with angular velocity , similar to Eq. 2, the proposed T exerted on the sphere is m r T n 3 1 . 12 is opposite to the direction of the rotation. The torque causes the negative angular acceleration dt d I T where I is the moment of inertia of the sphere in the dark matter field fluid 8 2 1 5 2 n r m , the equation of rotation for the sphere in the dark matter field fluid is n r dt 20 exp 1 0 t r where 0 is the initial angular velocity. One can see that the angular velocity of the sphere exponentially decreases with time and the angular deceleration is proportional to its angular velocity. For the same celestial sphere, combining Eq. 9 and Eq. 15 yields 67 .1 3 5 1 dt dR R dt d The significance of Eq. 17 is that it contains only observed data without assumptions and undetermined parameters therefore, it is a critical test for this model. For two different celestial spheres in the same system, combining Eq. 9 and Eq. 15 yields 67 .1 3 5 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 n r r dt dR R dt d This is another critical test for this model. 9 4.

The solar system is complex, the Earth and the Moon experience not only the interaction of the Sun but also interactions of other planets. Let us consider the local Earth Moon gravitational system as an isolated local gravitational system, i.e., the influence from the Sun and other planets on the rotation and orbital motion of the Moon and on the rotation of the Earth is assumed negligible compared to the forces exerted by the moon and earth on each other.

      "Chunk: arXiv 0704.0004v1 math.CO 31 Mar 2007 A Determinant of Stirling Cycle Numbers Counts Unlabeled Acyclic Single Source Automata DAVID CALLAN Department of Statistics University of Wisconsin Madison 1300 University Ave Madison, WI 53706 1532 callan stat.wisc.edu March 30, 2007 Abstract We show that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic single source automata. The proof involves a bijection from these automata to certain marked lattice paths and a sign reversing involution to evaluate the deter minant. 1 Introduction The chief purpose of this paper is to show bijectively that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic single source automata. Specifically, let Ak n denote the kn kn matrix with i, j entry i 1 k 2 i 1 k 1 i j , where i j is the Stirling cycle number, the number of permutations on i with j cycles. For example, 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 11 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 11 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 10 35 50 24 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 10 35 50 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 15 85 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 15 . 1 As evident in the example, Ak n is formed from k copies of each of rows 2 through n 1 of the Stirling cycle triangle, arranged so that the first nonzero entry in each row is a 1 and, after the first row, this 1 occurs just before the main diagonal in other words, Ak n is a Hessenberg matrix with 1s on the infra diagonal. We will show Main Theorem. The determinant of Ak n is the number of unlabeled acyclic single source automata with n transient states on a k 1 letter input alphabet. Section 2 reviews basic terminology for automata and recurrence relations to count finite acyclic automata. Section 3 introduces column marked subdiagonal paths, which play an intermediate role, and a way to code them. Section 4 presents a bijection from these column marked subdiagonal paths to unlabeled acyclic single source automata. Fi nally, Section 5 evaluates det Ak n using a sign reversing involution and shows that the determinant counts the codes for column marked subdiagonal paths. 2 Automata A complete, deterministic automaton consists of a set of states and an input alphabet whose letters transform the states among themselves a letter and a state produce another state possibly the same one . A finite automaton finite set of states, finite input alphabet of, say, k letters can be represented as a k regular directed multigraph with ordered edges the vertices represent the states and the first, second, . . . edge from a vertex give the effect of the first, second, . . . alphabet letter on that state. A finite automaton cannot be acyclic in the usual sense of no cycles pick a vertex and follow any path from it. This path must ultimately hit a previously encountered vertex, thereby creating a cycle. So the term acyclic is used in the looser sense that only one vertex, called the sink, is involved in cycles. This means that all edges from the sink loop back to itself and may safely be omitted and all other paths feed into the sink. A non sink state is called transient. The size of an acyclic automaton is the number of transient states. An acyclic automaton of size n thus has transient states which we label 1, 2, . . ., n and a sink, labeled n 1.

      "Chunk: to x using this same procedure. Finally, slide pebbles along the path from the original endpoints v to u specified by the successor array s v , s s v , ... The correctness of Algorithm 18 comes from the fact that it is implementing the shortcut construction. Efficiency comes from the fact that instead of potentially moving the pebble back and forth, Algorithm 18 pre computes a canonical path crossing each edge of H at most three times once in the initial depth first search, and twice while converting the initial path to a canonical one. It follows that each accepted edges takes O n time, for a total of O n2 time spent processing edges in H. Although we have not discussed this explicity, for the algorithm to be efficient we need to maintain components as in . After each accepted edge, the components of H can be updated in time O n . Finally, the results of show that the rejected edges take an amortized O time each. 16 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Summarizing, we have shown that the canonical pebble game with colors solves the decom position problem in time O n2 . 9. An important special case Rigidity in dimension 2 and slider pinning In this short section we present a new application for the special case of practical importance, , . As discussed in the introduction, Laman s theorem characterizes minimally rigid graphs as the 2,3 tight graphs. In recent work on slider pinning, developed after the current paper was submitted, we introduced the slider pinning model of rigidity . Com binatorially, we model the bar slider frameworks as simple graphs together with some loops placed on their vertices in such a way that there are no more than 2 loops per vertex, one of each color. We characterize the minimally rigid bar slider graphs as graphs that are 1. 2,3 sparse for subgraphs containing no loops. 2. 2,0 tight when loops are included. We call these graphs 2,0,3 graded tight, and they are a special case of the graded sparse graphs studied in our paper . The connection with the pebble games in this paper is the following. Corollary 19 Pebble games and slider pinning . In any 2,3 pebble game graph, if we replace pebbles by loops, we obtain a 2,0,3 graded tight graph. Proof. Follows from invariant I3 of Lemma 7. In , we study a special case of slider pinning where every slider is either vertical or horizontal. We model the sliders as pre colored loops, with the color indicating x or y direction. For this axis parallel slider case, the minimally rigid graphs are characterized by 1. 2,3 sparse for subgraphs containing no loops. 2. Admit a 2 coloring of the edges so that each color is a forest i.e., has no cycles , and each monochromatic tree spans exactly one loop of its color. This also has an interpretation in terms of colored pebble games. Corollary 20 The pebble game with colors and slider pinning . In any canonical 2,3 pebble game with colors graph, if we replace pebbles by loops of the same color, we obtain the graph of a minimally pinned axis parallel bar slider framework. Proof. Follows from Theorem 4, and Lemma 12. 10. Conclusions and open problems We presented a new characterization of k,l sparse graphs, the pebble game with colors, and used it to give an efficient algorithm for finding decompositions of sparse graphs into edge disjoint trees. Our algorithm finds such sparsity certifying decompositions in the upper range and runs in time O n2 , which is as fast as the algorithms for recognizing sparse graphs in the upper range from . We also used the pebble game with colors to describe a new sparsity certifying decomposi tion that applies to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions\n",

      "Chunk: 17 We defined and studied a class of canonical pebble game constructions that correspond to either a maps and trees or proper lTk decomposition. This gives a new proof of the Tutte Nash Williams arboricity theorem and a unified proof of the previously studied decomposition cer tificates of sparsity. Canonical pebble game constructions also show the relationship between the l 1 pebble condition, which applies to the upper range of l, to matroid union augmenting paths, which do not apply in the upper range. Algorithmic consequences and open problems. In , Gabow and Westermann give an O n3 2 algorithm for recognizing sparse graphs in the lower range and extracting sparse subgraphs from dense ones. Their technique is based on efficiently finding matroid union augmenting paths, which extend a maps and trees decomposition. The O n3 2 algorithm uses two subroutines to find augmenting paths cyclic scanning, which finds augmenting paths one at a time, and batch scanning, which finds groups of disjoint augmenting paths. We observe that Algorithm 17 can be used to replace cyclic scanning in Gabow and Wester mann s algorithm without changing the running time. The data structures used in the implemen tation of the pebble game, detailed in are simpler and easier to implement than those used to support cyclic scanning. The two major open algorithmic problems related to the pebble game are then Problem 1. Develop a pebble game algorithm with the properties of batch scanning and obtain an implementable O n3 2 algorithm for the lower range. Problem 2. Extend batch scanning to the l 1 pebble condition and derive an O n3 2 pebble game algorithm for the upper range. In particular, it would be of practical importance to find an implementable O n3 2 algorithm for decompositions into edge disjoint spanning trees.\n",

Such a monochromatic subgraph is called a map graph piece of G if it contains a cycle in G and a tree piece of G otherwise. The set of tree pieces of G is the collection of tree pieces induced by G . As with the corresponding definition for lTks, the set of tree pieces is defined relative to a specific sub graph in particular a tree piece may be part of a larger cycle that includes edges not spanned by G . The properties of pebble game decompositions are studied in Section 6, and Theorem 2 shows that each color must be 1,0 sparse. The orientation of the edges in Figure 4 a shows this. For example Figure 4 a shows a 2,2 tight graph with one possible pebble game decom position. The whole graph contains a gray tree piece and a black tree piece that is an isolated vertex. The subgraph in Figure 4 b has a black tree and a gray tree, with the edges of the black tree coming from a cycle in the larger graph. In Figure 4 c , however, the black cycle does not contribute a tree piece. All three tree pieces in this subgraph are single vertex gray trees. In the following discussion, we use the notation peb v for the number of pebbles on v and pebi v to indicate the number of pebbles of colors i on v. Table 2 lists the pebble game notation used in this paper. 4. Our Results We describe our results in this section. The rest of the paper provides the proofs. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions 7 Our first result is a strengthening of the pebble games of to include colors. It says that sparse graphs are exactly pebble game graphs. Recall that from now on, all pebble games discussed in this paper are our pebble game with colors unless noted explicitly. Theorem 1 Sparse graphs and pebble game graphs coincide . A graph G is k,l sparse with 0 l 2k 1 if and only if G is a pebble game graph. Next we consider pebble game decompositions, showing that they are a generalization of proper lTk decompositions that extend to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs. Theorem 2 The pebble game with colors decomposition . A graph G is a pebble game graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge disjoint subgraphs such that each is 1,0 sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ltree pieces of the 1,0 sparse graphs in the decomposition. The 1,0 sparse subgraphs in the statement of Theorem 2 are the colors of the pebbles thus Theorem 2 gives a characterization of the pebble game with colors decompositions obtained by playing the pebble game defined in the previous section. Notice the similarity between the requirement that the set of tree pieces have size at least lin Theorem 2 and the definition of a proper lTk. Our next results show that for any pebble game graph, we can specialize its pebble game construction to generate a decomposition that is a maps and trees or proper lTk . We call these specialized pebble game constructions canonical, and using canonical pebble game construc tions, we obtain new direct proofs of existing arboricity results. We observe Theorem 2 that maps and trees are special cases of the pebble game decompo sition both spanning trees and spanning map graphs are 1,0 sparse, and each of the spanning trees contributes at least one piece of tree to every subgraph. The case of proper lTk graphs is more subtle if each color in a pebble game decomposition is a forest, then we have\n",

These time and space bounds mean that our algorithm can be combined with those of without any change in complexity. 5. Pebble game graphs In this section we prove Theorem 1, a strengthening of results from to the pebble game with colors. Since many of the relevant properties of the pebble game with colors carry over directly from the pebble games of , we refer the reader there for the proofs. We begin by establishing some invariants that hold during the execution of the pebble game. Lemma 7 Pebble game invariants . During the execution of the pebble game, the following invariants are maintained in H I1 There are at least lpebbles on V. I2 For each vertex v, span v out v peb v k. I3 For each V V, span V out V peb V kn . I4 For every vertex v V, outi v pebi v 1. I5 Every maximal path consisting only of edges with color ci ends in either the first vertex with a pebble of color ci or a cycle. Proof. I1 , I2 , and I3 come directly from . I4 This invariant clearly holds at the initialization phase of the pebble game with colors. That add edge and pebble slide moves preserve I4 is clear from inspection. I5 By I4 , a monochromatic path of edges is forced to end only at a vertex with a pebble of the same color on it. If there is no pebble of that color reachable, then the path must eventually visit some vertex twice. From these invariants, we can show that the pebble game constructible graphs are sparse. Lemma 8 Pebble game graphs are sparse . Let H be a graph constructed with the pebble game. Then H is sparse. If there are exactly lpebbles on V H , then H is tight. The main step in proving that every sparse graph is a pebble game graph is the following. Recall that by bringing a pebble to v we mean reorienting H with pebble slide moves to reduce the out degree of v by one. Lemma 9 The l 1 pebble condition . Let vw be an edge such that H vw is sparse. If peb l 1, then a pebble not on can be brought to either v or\n",

      "Chunk: w. It follows that any sparse graph has a pebble game construction. Theorem 1 Sparse graphs and pebble game graphs coincide . A graph G is k,l sparse with 0 l 2k 1 if and only if G is a pebble game graph. 6. The pebble game with colors decomposition In this section we prove Theorem 2, which characterizes all pebble game decompositions. We start with the following lemmas about the structure of monochromatic connected components in H, the directed graph maintained during the pebble game. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions 9 Lemma 10 Monochromatic pebble game subgraphs are 1,0 sparse . Let Hi be the sub graph of H induced by edges with pebbles of color ci on them. Then Hi is 1,0 sparse, for ,...,k. Proof. By I4 Hi is a set of edges with out degree at most one for every vertex. Lemma 11 Tree pieces in a pebble game graph . Every subgraph of the directed graph H in a pebble game construction contains at least lmonochromatic tree pieces, and each of these is rooted at either a vertex with a pebble on it or a vertex that is the tail of an out edge. Recall that an out edge from a subgraph H V ,E is an edge vw with v V and vw E . Proof. Let H V ,E be a non empty subgraph of H, and assume without loss of generality that H is induced by V . By I3 , out V peb V l. We will show that each pebble and out edge tail is the root of a tree piece. Consider a vertex v V and a color ci. By I4 there is a unique monochromatic directed path of color ci starting at v. By I5 , if this path ends at a pebble, it does not have a cycle. Similarly, if this path reaches a vertex that is the tail of an out edge also in color ci i.e., if the monochromatic path from v leaves V , then the path cannot have a cycle in H . Since this argument works for any vertex in any color, for each color there is a partitioning of the vertices into those that can reach each pebble, out edge tail, or cycle. It follows that each pebble and out edge tail is the root of a monochromatic tree, as desired. Applied to the whole graph Lemma 11 gives us the following. Lemma 12 Pebbles are the roots of trees . In any pebble game configuration, each pebble of color ci is the root of a possibly empty monochromatic tree piece of color ci. Remark Haas showed in that in a lTk , a subgraph induced by n 2 vertices with m edges has exactly kn m tree pieces in it. Lemma 11 strengthens Haas result by extending it to the lower range and giving a construction that finds the tree pieces, showing the connection between the l 1 pebble condition and the hereditary condition on proper lTk . We conclude our investigation of arbitrary pebble game constructions with a description of the decomposition induced by the pebble game with colors. Theorem 2 The pebble game with colors decomposition . A graph G is a pebble game graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge disjoint subgraphs such that each is 1,0 sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ltree pieces of the 1,0 sparse graphs in the decomposition. Proof. Let G be a pebble game graph. The existence of the k edge disjoint 1,0 sparse sub graphs was shown in Lemma 10, and Lemma 11 proves the condition on subgraphs. For the other direction, we observe that a color ci with ti tree pieces in a given subgraph can span at most n ti edges summing over all the colors shows that a graph with\n",

      "Chunk: a pebble game decomposition must be sparse. Apply Theorem 1 to complete the proof. Remark We observe that a pebble game decomposition for a Laman graph may be read out of the bipartite matching used in Hendrickson s Laman graph extraction algorithm . Indeed, pebble game orientations have a natural correspondence with the bipartite matchings used in . 10 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Maps and trees are a special case of pebble game decompositions for tight graphs if there are no cycles in lof the colors, then the trees rooted at the corresponding lpebbles must be spanning, since they have n 1 edges. Also, if each color forms a forest in an upper range pebble game decomposition, then the tree pieces condition ensures that the pebble game de composition is a proper lTk. In the next section, we show that the pebble game can be specialized to correspond to maps and trees and proper lTk decompositions. 7. Canonical Pebble Game Constructions In this section we prove the main theorems Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 , continuing the inves tigation of decompositions induced by pebble game constructions by studying the case where a minimum number of monochromatic cycles are created. The main idea, captured in Lemma 15 and illustrated in Figure 6, is to avoid creating cycles while collecting pebbles. We show that this is always possible, implying that monochromatic map graphs are created only when we add more than k n 1 edges to some set of n vertices. For the lower range, this implies that every color is a forest. Every decomposition characterization of tight graphs discussed above follows immediately from the main theorem, giving new proofs of the previous results in a unified framework. In the proof, we will use two specializations of the pebble game moves. The first is a modi fication of the add edge move. Canonical add edge When performing an add edge move, cover the new edge with a color that is on both vertices if possible. If not, then take the highest numbered color present. The second is a restriction on which pebble slide moves we allow. Canonical pebble slide A pebble slide move is allowed only when it does not create a monochromatic cycle. We call a pebble game construction that uses only these moves canonical. In this section we will show that every pebble game graph has a canonical pebble game construction Lemma 14 and Lemma 15 and that canonical pebble game constructions correspond to proper lTk and maps and trees decompositions Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 . We begin with a technical lemma that motivates the definition of canonical pebble game constructions. It shows that the situations disallowed by the canonical moves are all the ways for cycles to form in the lowest lcolors. Lemma 13 Monochromatic cycle creation . Let v V have a pebble p of color ci on it and let w be a vertex in the same tree of color ci as v. A monochromatic cycle colored ci is created in exactly one of the following ways M1 The edge vw is added with an add edge move. M2 The edge wv is reversed by a pebble slide move and the pebble p is used to cover the reverse edge vw. Proof. Observe that the preconditions in the statement of the lemma are implied by Lemma 7. By Lemma 12 monochromatic cycles form when the last pebble of color ci is removed from a connected monochromatic subgraph. M1 and M2 are the only ways to do this in a pebble game construction, since the color of an edge only changes when it is inserted the first time or a new pebble is put on it by a pebble slide move.

      "Chunk: A type M1 move creates a cycle by adding a black edge. b A type M2 move creates a cycle with a pebble slide move. The vertices are labeled according to their role in the definition of the moves. Figure 5 a and Figure 5 b show examples of M1 and M2 map graph creation moves, respectively, in a 2,0 pebble game construction. We next show that if a graph has a pebble game construction, then it has a canonical peb ble game construction. This is done in two steps, considering the cases M1 and M2 sepa rately. The proof gives two constructions that implement the canonical add edge and canonical pebble slide moves. Lemma 14 The canonical add edge move . Let G be a graph with a pebble game construc tion. Cycle creation steps of type M1 can be eliminated in colors ci for 1 i l , where l min . Proof. For add edge moves, cover the edge with a color present on both v and w if possible. If this is not possible, then there are l 1 distinct colors present. Use the highest numbered color to cover the new edge. Remark We note that in the upper range, there is always a repeated color, so no canonical add edge moves create cycles in the upper range. The canonical pebble slide move is defined by a global condition. To prove that we obtain the same class of graphs using only canonical pebble slide moves, we need to extend Lemma 9 to only canonical moves. The main step is to show that if there is any sequence of moves that reorients a path from v to w, then there is a sequence of canonical moves that does the same thing. Lemma 15 The canonical pebble slide move . Any sequence of pebble slide moves leading to an add edge move can be replaced with one that has no M2 steps and allows the same add edge move. In other words, if it is possible to collect l 1 pebbles on the ends of an edge to be added, then it is possible to do this without creating any monochromatic cycles. 12 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the construction used in the proof of Lemma 15. We call this the shortcut construction by analogy to matroid union and intersection augmenting paths used in previous work on the lower range. Figure 6 shows the structure of the proof. The shortcut construction removes an M2 step at the beginning of a sequence that reorients a path from v to w with pebble slides. Since one application of the shortcut construction reorients a simple path from a vertex w to w, and a path from v to w is preserved, the shortcut construction can be applied inductively to find the sequence of moves we want. w v a v w b w v w c Fig. 6.

      "Chunk: The evolution of the Earth Moon system based on the dark matter field fluid model Hongjun Pan Department of Chemistry University of North Texas, Denton, Texas 76203, U. S. A. Abstract The evolution of Earth Moon system is described by the dark matter field fluid model with a non Newtonian approach proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth Moon system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the Moon Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche s limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from Earth Moon system data is 4.39 10 22 s 1m 1. This model predicts that the Mars s rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about 4.38 10 22 rad s 2. Key Words. dark matter, fluid, evolution, Earth, Moon, Mars 1 1. Introduction The popularly accepted theory for the formation of the Earth Moon system is that the Moon was formed from debris of a strong impact by a giant planetesimal with the Earth at the close of the planet forming period Hartmann and Davis 1975 . Since the formation of the Earth Moon system, it has been evolving at all time scale. It is well known that the Moon is receding from us and both the Earth s rotation and Moon s rotation are slowing. The popular theory is that the tidal friction causes all those changes based on the conservation of the angular momentum of the Earth Moon system. The situation becomes complicated in describing the past evolution of the Earth Moon system. Because the Moon is moving away from us and the Earth rotation is slowing, this means that the Moon was closer and the Earth rotation was faster in the past. Creationists argue that based on the tidal friction theory, the tidal friction should be stronger and the recessional rate of the Moon should be greater in the past, the distance of the Moon would quickly fall inside the Roche s limit for earth, 15500 km in which the Moon would be torn apart by gravity in 1 to 2 billion years ago. However, geological evidence indicates that the recession of the Moon in the past was slower than the present rate, i. e., the recession has been accelerating with time. Therefore, it must be concluded that tidal friction was very much less in the remote past than we would deduce on the basis of present day observations Stacey 1977 . This was called geological time scale difficulty or Lunar crisis and is one of the main arguments by creationists against the tidal friction theory Brush 1983 . But we have to consider the case carefully in various aspects. One possible scenario is that the Earth has been undergoing dynamic evolution at all time scale since 2 its inception, the geological and physical conditions such as the continent positions and drifting, the crust, surface temperature fluctuation like the glacial snowball effect, etc at remote past could be substantially different from currently, in which the tidal friction could be much less therefore, the receding rate of the Moon could be slower. Various tidal friction models were proposed in the past to describe the evolution of the Earth Moon system to avoid such difficulty or crisis and put the Moon at quite a comfortable distance from Earth at 4.5 billion years ago Hansen 1982, Kagan and Maslova 1994, Ray et al. 1999, Finch 1981, Slichter 1963 . The tidal friction theories explain that the present rate of tidal dissipation\n",

Kagan gave a detailed review about those tidal friction models Kagan 1997 . Those models are based on many assumptions about geological continental position and drifting and physical conditions in the past, and many parameters such as phase lag angle, multi mode approximation with time dependent frequencies of the resonance modes, etc. have to be introduced and carefully adjusted to make their predictions close to the geological evidence. However, those assumptions and parameters are still challenged, to certain extent, as concoction. The second possible scenario is that another mechanism could dominate the evolution of the Earth Moon system and the role of the tidal friction is not significant. In the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society, University of California at Riverside, the author proposed a dark matter field fluid model Pan 2005 with a non Newtonian approach, the current Moon and Earth data agree with this model very well. This paper will demonstrate that the past evolution of Moon Earth system can be described by the dark matter field fluid model without any assumptions 3 about past geological and physical conditions. Although the subject of the evolution of the Earth Moon system has been extensively studied analytically or numerically, to the author s knowledge, there are no theories similar or equivalent to this model. 2. Invisible matter In modern cosmology, it was proposed that the visible matter in the universe is about 2 10 of the total matter and about 90 98 of total matter is currently invisible which is called dark matter and dark energy, such invisible matter has an anti gravity property to make the universe expanding faster and faster. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, the evolution of the universe should be dominated by the physical mechanism of such invisible matter, such physical mechanism could be far beyond the current Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics, and the Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics could reflect only a corner of the iceberg of the greater physics. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, it should be more reasonable to think that such dominant invisible matter spreads in everywhere of the universe the density of the invisible matter may vary from place to place in other words, all visible matter objects should be surrounded by such invisible matter and the motion of the visible matter objects should be affected by the invisible matter if there are interactions between the visible matter and the invisible matter. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, the size of the particles of the invisible matter should be very small and below the 4 detection limit of the current technology otherwise, it would be detected long time ago with such dominant amount. With such invisible matter in mind, we move to the next section to develop the dark matter field fluid model with non Newtonian approach. For simplicity, all invisible matter dark matter, dark energy and possible other terms is called dark matter here. 3. The dark matter field fluid model In this proposed model, it is assumed that 1. A celestial body rotates and moves in the space, which, for simplicity, is uniformly filled with the dark matter which is in quiescent state relative to the motion of the celestial body. The dark matter possesses a field property and a fluid property it can interact with the celestial body with its fluid and field properties therefore, it can have energy exchange with the celestial body, and affect the motion of the celestial body. 2. The fluid property follows the general principle of fluid mechanics. The dark matter field fluid particles\n",

      "Chunk: may be so small that they can easily permeate into ordinary baryonic matter i. e., ordinary matter objects could be saturated with such dark matter field fluid. Thus, the whole celestial body interacts with the dark matter field fluid, in the manner of a sponge moving thru water. The nature of the field property of the dark matter field fluid is unknown. It is here assumed that the interaction of the field associated with the dark matter field fluid with the celestial body is proportional to the mass of the celestial body. The dark matter field fluid is assumed to have a repulsive force against the gravitational force towards baryonic matter. The nature and mechanism of such repulsive force is unknown. 5 With the assumptions above, one can study how the dark matter field fluid may influence the motion of a celestial body and compare the results with observations. The common shape of celestial bodies is spherical. According to Stokes s law, a rigid non permeable sphere moving through a quiescent fluid with a sufficiently low Reynolds number experiences a resistance force F rv F , r is the radius of the sphere, and is the fluid viscosity constant. The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 1 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. For a rigid sphere moving through the dark matter field fluid, due to the dual properties of the dark matter field fluid and its permeation into the sphere, the force F may not be proportional to the radius of the sphere. Also, F may be proportional to the mass of the sphere due to the field interaction. Therefore, with the combined effects of both fluid and field, the force exerted on the sphere by the dark matter field fluid is assumed to be of the scaled form mv r F where n is a parameter arising from saturation by dark matter field fluid, the r1 n can be viewed as the effective radius with the same unit as r, m is the mass of the sphere, and is the dark matter field fluid constant, which is equivalent to . The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 2 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. The force described by Eq. 2 is velocity dependent and causes negative acceleration. According to Newton s second law of motion, the equation of motion for the sphere is mv r dt dv m Then 6 exp 1 0 vt r v v 6 where v0 is the initial velocity of the sphere. If the sphere revolves around a massive gravitational center, there are three forces in the line between the sphere and the gravitational center the gravitational force, the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force of the dark matter field fluid. The drag force in Eq. 3 reduces the orbital velocity and causes the sphere to move inward to the gravitational center. However, if the sum of the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force is stronger than the gravitational force, then, the sphere will move outward and recede from the gravitational center. This is the case of interest here. If the velocity change in Eq. 3 is sufficiently slow and the repulsive force is small compared to the gravitational force and centripetal acceleration force, then the rate of receding will be accordingly relatively slow. Therefore, the gravitational force and the centripetal acceleration force can be approximately treated in equilibrium at any time. The pseudo equilibrium equation is R mv R GMm 2 , M is the mass of the gravitational center, and R is the radius of the orbit. Inserting v of Eq. 4 into Eq. 5 yields 12 exp 1 2 0 t r v GM R or 12 exp 1 0 t r R R where 2 0 0 v GM . Note that R exponentially increases with time.\n",

      "Chunk: The increase of orbital energy with the receding comes from the repulsive force of dark matter field fluid. The recessional rate of the sphere is R r dt dR The acceleration of the recession is R r dt R d n 2 1 2 2 . The recessional acceleration is positive and proportional to its distance to the gravitational center, so the recession is faster and faster. According to the mechanics of fluids, for a rigid non permeable sphere rotating about its central axis in the quiescent fluid, the torque T exerted by the fluid on the sphere is 3 8 r is the angular velocity of the sphere. The direction of the torque in Eq. 11 is opposite to the direction of the rotation. In the case of a sphere rotating in the quiescent dark matter field fluid with angular velocity , similar to Eq. 2, the proposed T exerted on the sphere is m r T n 3 1 . 12 is opposite to the direction of the rotation. The torque causes the negative angular acceleration dt d I T where I is the moment of inertia of the sphere in the dark matter field fluid 8 2 1 5 2 n r m , the equation of rotation for the sphere in the dark matter field fluid is n r dt 20 exp 1 0 t r where 0 is the initial angular velocity. One can see that the angular velocity of the sphere exponentially decreases with time and the angular deceleration is proportional to its angular velocity. For the same celestial sphere, combining Eq. 9 and Eq. 15 yields 67 .1 3 5 1 dt dR R dt d The significance of Eq. 17 is that it contains only observed data without assumptions and undetermined parameters therefore, it is a critical test for this model.

      "Chunk: arXiv 0704.0004v1 math.CO 31 Mar 2007 A Determinant of Stirling Cycle Numbers Counts Unlabeled Acyclic Single Source Automata DAVID CALLAN Department of Statistics University of Wisconsin Madison 1300 University Ave Madison, WI 53706 1532 callan stat.wisc.edu March 30, 2007 Abstract We show that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic single source automata. The proof involves a bijection from these automata to certain marked lattice paths and a sign reversing involution to evaluate the deter minant. 1 Introduction The chief purpose of this paper is to show bijectively that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic single source automata. Specifically, let Ak n denote the kn kn matrix with i, j entry i 1 k 2 i 1 k 1 i j , where i j is the Stirling cycle number, the number of permutations on i with j cycles. For example, 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 11 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 11 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 10 35 50 24 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 10 35 50 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 15 85 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 15 . 1 As evident in the example, Ak n is formed from k copies of each of rows 2 through n 1 of the Stirling cycle triangle, arranged so that the first nonzero entry in each row is a 1 and, after the first row, this 1 occurs just before the main diagonal in other words, Ak n is a Hessenberg matrix with 1s on the infra diagonal. We will show Main Theorem. The determinant of Ak n is the number of unlabeled acyclic single source automata with n transient states on a k 1 letter input alphabet. Section 2 reviews basic terminology for automata and recurrence relations to count finite acyclic automata. Section 3 introduces column marked subdiagonal paths, which play an intermediate role, and a way to code them. Section 4 presents a bijection from these column marked subdiagonal paths to unlabeled acyclic single source automata. Fi nally, Section 5 evaluates det Ak n using a sign reversing involution and shows that the determinant counts the codes for column marked subdiagonal paths. 2 Automata A complete, deterministic automaton consists of a set of states and an input alphabet whose letters transform the states among themselves a letter and a state produce another state possibly the same one . A finite automaton finite set of states, finite input alphabet of, say, k letters can be represented as a k regular directed multigraph with ordered edges the vertices represent the states and the first, second, . . . edge from a vertex give the effect of the first, second, . . . alphabet letter on that state. A finite automaton cannot be acyclic in the usual sense of no cycles pick a vertex and follow any path from it. This path must ultimately hit a previously encountered vertex, thereby creating a cycle. So the term acyclic is used in the looser sense that only one vertex, called the sink, is involved in cycles. This means that all edges from the sink loop back to itself and may safely be omitted and all other paths feed into the sink. A non sink state is called transient. The size of an acyclic automaton is the number of transient states. An acyclic automaton of size n thus has transient states which we label 1, 2, . . ., n and a sink, labeled n 1.

      "Chunk: the following recurrence relation for the number ak n 2 of acyclic automata of size n on a k letter input alphabet k 1 ak n n 1 X 1 n j 1 n j j 1 k n j ak j , n 1. A source is a vertex with no incoming edges. A finite acyclic automaton has at least one source because a path traversed backward v1 v2 v3 . . . must have distinct vertices and so cannot continue indefinitely. An automaton is single source or initially connected if it has only one source. Let Bk n denote the set of single source acyclic finite SAF automata on a k letter input alphabet with vertices 1, 2, . . ., n 1 where 1 is the source and n 1 is the sink, and set bk n Bk n . The two line representation of an automaton in Bk n is the 2 kn matrix whose columns list the edges in order. For example, ! is in B3 and the source to sink paths in B include 1 a 2 a 6, 1 b 4 c 3 a 6, 1 b 4 b 5 b 2 b 6, where the alphabet is . Proposition 1. The number bk n of SAF automata of size n on a k letter input alphabet n, k 1 is given by bk n n X 1 n i n 1 i 1 i 1 k n i ak i Remark This formula is a bit more succinct than the the recurrence in 1, Theorem 3.2 . Proof Consider the set A of acyclic automata with transient vertices n in which 1 is a source. Call 2, 3, . . ., n the interior vertices. For X 2, n , let f X automata in A whose set of interior vertices includes X, g X automata in A whose set of interior vertices is precisely X. Then f X P Y X Y 2,n g Y and by M obius inversion on the lattice of subsets of 2, n , g X P Y X Y 2,n X, Y f Y where X, Y is the M obius function for this 3 lattice. Since X, Y 1 Y X if X Y , we have in particular that g X Y 2,n 1 Y f Y . Let Y n i so that 1 i n. When Y consists entirely of sources, the vertices in n 1 Y and their incident edges form a subautomaton with i transient states there are ak i such. Also, all edges from the n i vertices comprising Y go directly into n 1 Y i 1 k n i choices. Thus f Y i 1 k n i ak i . By definition, g is the number of automata in A for which 1 is the only source, that is, g bk n and the Proposition now follows from . An unlabeled SAF automaton is an equivalence class of SAF automata under relabeling of the interior vertices. Liskovets notes and we prove below that Bk n has no nontrivial automorphisms, that is, each of the n 1 ! relabelings of the interior vertices of B Bk n produces a different automaton. So unlabeled SAF automata of size n on a k letter alphabet are counted by 1 n 1 !bk n . The next result establishes a canonical representative in each relabeling class. Proposition 2. Each equivalence class in Bk n under relabeling of interior vertices has size n 1 ! and contains exactly one SAF automaton with the last occurrences increas ing property the last occurrences of the interior vertices 2, 3, . . ., n in the bottom row of its two line representation occur in that order. Proof The first assertion follows from the fact that the interior vertices of an au tomaton\n",

      "Chunk: B bk n can be distinguished intrinsically, that is, independent of their labeling. To see this, first mark the source, namely 1, with a mark new label v1 and observe that there exists at least one interior vertex whose only incoming edge s are from the source the only currently marked vertex for otherwise a cycle would be present. For each such interior vertex v, choose the last edge from the marked vertex to v using the built in ordering of these edges. This determines an order on these vertices mark them in order v2, v3, . . . , vj j 2 . If there still remain unmarked interior vertices, at least one of them has incoming edges only from a marked vertex or again a cycle would be present. For each such vertex, use the last incoming edge from a marked vertex, where now edges are arranged in order of initial vertex vi with the built in order breaking ties, to order and 4 mark these vertices vj 1, vj 2, . . .. Proceed similarly until all interior vertices are marked. For example, for ! , , namely 4, whose only incoming edge is from the source, and so . Now all incoming edges to both 3 and 5 are from marked vertices and the last such edges built in order comes into play are 4 b 5 and 4 c 3 putting vertices 3, 5 in the order 5, 3. So 3. Finally, . This proves the first assertion. By construction of the vs, relabeling each interior vertex i with the subscript of its corresponding v produces an automaton in Bk n with the last occurrences increasing property and is the only relabeling that does so.

      "Chunk: n is the total weight of certain lists of permutations, each list carrying weight 1. Then a weight reversing involution cancels all 1 weights and reduces the problem to counting the surviving lists. These surviving lists are essentially the codes for paths in C 1 n, p , and the Main Theorem follows from 4. To describe the permutations giving a nonzero contribution to det A n P sgn Qn , i , define the code of a permutation on n to be the list ci n i i 1 . Since the i, j entry of A n , i 1 2i j , is 0 unless j i 1, we must have i i 1 for all i. It is well known that there are 2n 1 such permutations, corresponding to compositions of n, with codes characterized by the following four conditions i ci 0 for all i, ii c1 1, iii each ci 1 is immediately followed by ci 1 zeros in the list, iv Pn n. Let us call such a list a padded composition of n deleting the zeros is a bijection to ordinary compositions of n. For example, 3, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0 is a padded 8 composition of 6. For a permutation with padded composition code c, the nonzero entries in c give the cycle lengths of . Hence sgn , which is the parity of n cycles in , is given by 1 0s in c. We have det A n P sgn Qn , i P sgn Qn i 1 2i i , and so det A n X c 1 0s in c n Y i 1 i 1 ci where the sum is restricted to padded compositions c of n with ci i for all i A002083 because i 1 i 1 ci 0 unless ci i. Henceforth, let us write all permutations in standard cycle form whereby the smallest entry occurs first in each cycle and these smallest entries increase left to right. Thus, with dashes separating cycles, 154 2 36 is the standard cycle form of the permutation 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 2 6 1 4 3 . We define a nonfirst entry to be one that does not start a cycle. Thus the preceding permutation has 3 nonfirst entries 5,4,6. Note that the number of nonfirst entries is 0 only for the identity permutation. We denote an identity permutation of any size by o . By definition of Stirling cycle number, the product in counts lists i n i is a permutation on i 1 with i 1 ci cycles, equivalently, with ci i nonfirst entries. So define Ln to be the set all lists of permutations i n i is a permutation on i 1 , nonfirst entries in i is i, 1 is the transposition 1,2 , each nonidentity permutation i is immediately followed by ci 1 o s where ci 1 is the number of nonfirst entries in i so the total number of nonfirst entries is n . Assign a weight to Ln by wt 1 o s in . Then det A n X Ln wt . We now define a weight reversing involution on most of Ln. Given Ln, scan the list of its component permutations 1, 2 , 2, 3, . . . left to right. Stop at the first one that either i has more than one nonfirst entry, or ii has only one nonfirst entry, b say, and . Say k is the permutation where we stop. 9 In case i decrement i.e. decrease by 1 the number of o s in the list by splitting k into two nonidentity permutations as follows. Let m be the largest nonfirst entry of k and let lbe its predecessor. Replace k and its successor in the list necessarily an o by the following two permutations\n",

      "Chunk: to x using this same procedure. Finally, slide pebbles along the path from the original endpoints v to u specified by the successor array s v , s s v , ... The correctness of Algorithm 18 comes from the fact that it is implementing the shortcut construction. Efficiency comes from the fact that instead of potentially moving the pebble back and forth, Algorithm 18 pre computes a canonical path crossing each edge of H at most three times once in the initial depth first search, and twice while converting the initial path to a canonical one. It follows that each accepted edges takes O n time, for a total of O n2 time spent processing edges in H. Although we have not discussed this explicity, for the algorithm to be efficient we need to maintain components as in . After each accepted edge, the components of H can be updated in time O n . Finally, the results of show that the rejected edges take an amortized O time each. 16 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Summarizing, we have shown that the canonical pebble game with colors solves the decom position problem in time O n2 . 9. An important special case Rigidity in dimension 2 and slider pinning In this short section we present a new application for the special case of practical importance, , . As discussed in the introduction, Laman s theorem characterizes minimally rigid graphs as the 2,3 tight graphs. In recent work on slider pinning, developed after the current paper was submitted, we introduced the slider pinning model of rigidity . Com binatorially, we model the bar slider frameworks as simple graphs together with some loops placed on their vertices in such a way that there are no more than 2 loops per vertex, one of each color. We characterize the minimally rigid bar slider graphs as graphs that are 1. 2,3 sparse for subgraphs containing no loops. 2. 2,0 tight when loops are included. We call these graphs 2,0,3 graded tight, and they are a special case of the graded sparse graphs studied in our paper . The connection with the pebble games in this paper is the following. Corollary 19 Pebble games and slider pinning . In any 2,3 pebble game graph, if we replace pebbles by loops, we obtain a 2,0,3 graded tight graph. Proof. Follows from invariant I3 of Lemma 7. In , we study a special case of slider pinning where every slider is either vertical or horizontal. We model the sliders as pre colored loops, with the color indicating x or y direction. For this axis parallel slider case, the minimally rigid graphs are characterized by 1. 2,3 sparse for subgraphs containing no loops. 2. Admit a 2 coloring of the edges so that each color is a forest i.e., has no cycles , and each monochromatic tree spans exactly one loop of its color. This also has an interpretation in terms of colored pebble games. Corollary 20 The pebble game with colors and slider pinning . In any canonical 2,3 pebble game with colors graph, if we replace pebbles by loops of the same color, we obtain the graph of a minimally pinned axis parallel bar slider framework. Proof. Follows from Theorem 4, and Lemma 12. 10. Conclusions and open problems We presented a new characterization of k,l sparse graphs, the pebble game with colors, and used it to give an efficient algorithm for finding decompositions of sparse graphs into edge disjoint trees. Our algorithm finds such sparsity certifying decompositions in the upper range and runs in time O n2 , which is as fast as the algorithms for recognizing sparse graphs in the upper range from . We also used the pebble game with colors to describe a new sparsity certifying decomposi tion that applies to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions\n",

      "Chunk: 17 We defined and studied a class of canonical pebble game constructions that correspond to either a maps and trees or proper lTk decomposition. This gives a new proof of the Tutte Nash Williams arboricity theorem and a unified proof of the previously studied decomposition cer tificates of sparsity. Canonical pebble game constructions also show the relationship between the l 1 pebble condition, which applies to the upper range of l, to matroid union augmenting paths, which do not apply in the upper range. Algorithmic consequences and open problems. In , Gabow and Westermann give an O n3 2 algorithm for recognizing sparse graphs in the lower range and extracting sparse subgraphs from dense ones. Their technique is based on efficiently finding matroid union augmenting paths, which extend a maps and trees decomposition. The O n3 2 algorithm uses two subroutines to find augmenting paths cyclic scanning, which finds augmenting paths one at a time, and batch scanning, which finds groups of disjoint augmenting paths. We observe that Algorithm 17 can be used to replace cyclic scanning in Gabow and Wester mann s algorithm without changing the running time. The data structures used in the implemen tation of the pebble game, detailed in are simpler and easier to implement than those used to support cyclic scanning. The two major open algorithmic problems related to the pebble game are then Problem 1. Develop a pebble game algorithm with the properties of batch scanning and obtain an implementable O n3 2 algorithm for the lower range. Problem 2. Extend batch scanning to the l 1 pebble condition and derive an O n3 2 pebble game algorithm for the upper range. In particular, it would be of practical importance to find an implementable O n3 2 algorithm for decompositions into edge disjoint spanning trees.\n",

Such a monochromatic subgraph is called a map graph piece of G if it contains a cycle in G and a tree piece of G otherwise. The set of tree pieces of G is the collection of tree pieces induced by G . As with the corresponding definition for lTks, the set of tree pieces is defined relative to a specific sub graph in particular a tree piece may be part of a larger cycle that includes edges not spanned by G . The properties of pebble game decompositions are studied in Section 6, and Theorem 2 shows that each color must be 1,0 sparse. The orientation of the edges in Figure 4 a shows this. For example Figure 4 a shows a 2,2 tight graph with one possible pebble game decom position. The whole graph contains a gray tree piece and a black tree piece that is an isolated vertex. The subgraph in Figure 4 b has a black tree and a gray tree, with the edges of the black tree coming from a cycle in the larger graph. In Figure 4 c , however, the black cycle does not contribute a tree piece. All three tree pieces in this subgraph are single vertex gray trees. In the following discussion, we use the notation peb v for the number of pebbles on v and pebi v to indicate the number of pebbles of colors i on v. Table 2 lists the pebble game notation used in this paper. 4. Our Results We describe our results in this section. The rest of the paper provides the proofs. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions 7 Our first result is a strengthening of the pebble games of to include colors. It says that sparse graphs are exactly pebble game graphs. Recall that from now on, all pebble games discussed in this paper are our pebble game with colors unless noted explicitly. Theorem 1 Sparse graphs and pebble game graphs coincide . A graph G is k,l sparse with 0 l 2k 1 if and only if G is a pebble game graph. Next we consider pebble game decompositions, showing that they are a generalization of proper lTk decompositions that extend to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs. Theorem 2 The pebble game with colors decomposition . A graph G is a pebble game graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge disjoint subgraphs such that each is 1,0 sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ltree pieces of the 1,0 sparse graphs in the decomposition. The 1,0 sparse subgraphs in the statement of Theorem 2 are the colors of the pebbles thus Theorem 2 gives a characterization of the pebble game with colors decompositions obtained by playing the pebble game defined in the previous section. Notice the similarity between the requirement that the set of tree pieces have size at least lin Theorem 2 and the definition of a proper lTk. Our next results show that for any pebble game graph, we can specialize its pebble game construction to generate a decomposition that is a maps and trees or proper lTk . We call these specialized pebble game constructions canonical, and using canonical pebble game construc tions, we obtain new direct proofs of existing arboricity results. We observe Theorem 2 that maps and trees are special cases of the pebble game decompo sition both spanning trees and spanning map graphs are 1,0 sparse, and each of the spanning trees contributes at least one piece of tree to every subgraph. The case of proper lTk graphs is more subtle if each color in a pebble game decomposition is a forest, then we have\n",

Pebble game graphs In this section we prove Theorem 1, a strengthening of results from to the pebble game with colors. Since many of the relevant properties of the pebble game with colors carry over directly from the pebble games of , we refer the reader there for the proofs. We begin by establishing some invariants that hold during the execution of the pebble game. Lemma 7 Pebble game invariants . During the execution of the pebble game, the following invariants are maintained in H I1 There are at least lpebbles on V. I2 For each vertex v, span v out v peb v k. I3 For each V V, span V out V peb V kn . I4 For every vertex v V, outi v pebi v 1. I5 Every maximal path consisting only of edges with color ci ends in either the first vertex with a pebble of color ci or a cycle. Proof. I1 , I2 , and I3 come directly from . I4 This invariant clearly holds at the initialization phase of the pebble game with colors. That add edge and pebble slide moves preserve I4 is clear from inspection. I5 By I4 , a monochromatic path of edges is forced to end only at a vertex with a pebble of the same color on it. If there is no pebble of that color reachable, then the path must eventually visit some vertex twice. From these invariants, we can show that the pebble game constructible graphs are sparse. Lemma 8 Pebble game graphs are sparse . Let H be a graph constructed with the pebble game. Then H is sparse. If there are exactly lpebbles on V H , then H is tight. The main step in proving that every sparse graph is a pebble game graph is the following. Recall that by bringing a pebble to v we mean reorienting H with pebble slide moves to reduce the out degree of v by one. Lemma 9 The l 1 pebble condition . Let vw be an edge such that H vw is sparse. If peb l 1, then a pebble not on can be brought to either v or\n",

      "Chunk: w. It follows that any sparse graph has a pebble game construction. Theorem 1 Sparse graphs and pebble game graphs coincide . A graph G is k,l sparse with 0 l 2k 1 if and only if G is a pebble game graph. 6. The pebble game with colors decomposition In this section we prove Theorem 2, which characterizes all pebble game decompositions. We start with the following lemmas about the structure of monochromatic connected components in H, the directed graph maintained during the pebble game. Sparsity certifying Graph Decompositions 9 Lemma 10 Monochromatic pebble game subgraphs are 1,0 sparse . Let Hi be the sub graph of H induced by edges with pebbles of color ci on them. Then Hi is 1,0 sparse, for ,...,k. Proof. By I4 Hi is a set of edges with out degree at most one for every vertex. Lemma 11 Tree pieces in a pebble game graph . Every subgraph of the directed graph H in a pebble game construction contains at least lmonochromatic tree pieces, and each of these is rooted at either a vertex with a pebble on it or a vertex that is the tail of an out edge. Recall that an out edge from a subgraph H V ,E is an edge vw with v V and vw E . Proof. Let H V ,E be a non empty subgraph of H, and assume without loss of generality that H is induced by V . By I3 , out V peb V l. We will show that each pebble and out edge tail is the root of a tree piece. Consider a vertex v V and a color ci. By I4 there is a unique monochromatic directed path of color ci starting at v. By I5 , if this path ends at a pebble, it does not have a cycle. Similarly, if this path reaches a vertex that is the tail of an out edge also in color ci i.e., if the monochromatic path from v leaves V , then the path cannot have a cycle in H . Since this argument works for any vertex in any color, for each color there is a partitioning of the vertices into those that can reach each pebble, out edge tail, or cycle. It follows that each pebble and out edge tail is the root of a monochromatic tree, as desired. Applied to the whole graph Lemma 11 gives us the following. Lemma 12 Pebbles are the roots of trees . In any pebble game configuration, each pebble of color ci is the root of a possibly empty monochromatic tree piece of color ci. Remark Haas showed in that in a lTk , a subgraph induced by n 2 vertices with m edges has exactly kn m tree pieces in it. Lemma 11 strengthens Haas result by extending it to the lower range and giving a construction that finds the tree pieces, showing the connection between the l 1 pebble condition and the hereditary condition on proper lTk . We conclude our investigation of arbitrary pebble game constructions with a description of the decomposition induced by the pebble game with colors. Theorem 2 The pebble game with colors decomposition . A graph G is a pebble game graph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge disjoint subgraphs such that each is 1,0 sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ltree pieces of the 1,0 sparse graphs in the decomposition. Proof. Let G be a pebble game graph. The existence of the k edge disjoint 1,0 sparse sub graphs was shown in Lemma 10, and Lemma 11 proves the condition on subgraphs. For the other direction, we observe that a color ci with ti tree pieces in a given subgraph can span at most n ti edges summing over all the colors shows that a graph with\n",

      "Chunk: a pebble game decomposition must be sparse. Apply Theorem 1 to complete the proof. Remark We observe that a pebble game decomposition for a Laman graph may be read out of the bipartite matching used in Hendrickson s Laman graph extraction algorithm . Indeed, pebble game orientations have a natural correspondence with the bipartite matchings used in . 10 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Maps and trees are a special case of pebble game decompositions for tight graphs if there are no cycles in lof the colors, then the trees rooted at the corresponding lpebbles must be spanning, since they have n 1 edges. Also, if each color forms a forest in an upper range pebble game decomposition, then the tree pieces condition ensures that the pebble game de composition is a proper lTk. In the next section, we show that the pebble game can be specialized to correspond to maps and trees and proper lTk decompositions. 7. Canonical Pebble Game Constructions In this section we prove the main theorems Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 , continuing the inves tigation of decompositions induced by pebble game constructions by studying the case where a minimum number of monochromatic cycles are created. The main idea, captured in Lemma 15 and illustrated in Figure 6, is to avoid creating cycles while collecting pebbles. We show that this is always possible, implying that monochromatic map graphs are created only when we add more than k n 1 edges to some set of n vertices. For the lower range, this implies that every color is a forest. Every decomposition characterization of tight graphs discussed above follows immediately from the main theorem, giving new proofs of the previous results in a unified framework. In the proof, we will use two specializations of the pebble game moves. The first is a modi fication of the add edge move. Canonical add edge When performing an add edge move, cover the new edge with a color that is on both vertices if possible. If not, then take the highest numbered color present. The second is a restriction on which pebble slide moves we allow. Canonical pebble slide A pebble slide move is allowed only when it does not create a monochromatic cycle. We call a pebble game construction that uses only these moves canonical. In this section we will show that every pebble game graph has a canonical pebble game construction Lemma 14 and Lemma 15 and that canonical pebble game constructions correspond to proper lTk and maps and trees decompositions Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 . We begin with a technical lemma that motivates the definition of canonical pebble game constructions. It shows that the situations disallowed by the canonical moves are all the ways for cycles to form in the lowest lcolors. Lemma 13 Monochromatic cycle creation . Let v V have a pebble p of color ci on it and let w be a vertex in the same tree of color ci as v. A monochromatic cycle colored ci is created in exactly one of the following ways M1 The edge vw is added with an add edge move. M2 The edge wv is reversed by a pebble slide move and the pebble p is used to cover the reverse edge vw. Proof. Observe that the preconditions in the statement of the lemma are implied by Lemma 7. By Lemma 12 monochromatic cycles form when the last pebble of color ci is removed from a connected monochromatic subgraph. M1 and M2 are the only ways to do this in a pebble game construction, since the color of an edge only changes when it is inserted the first time or a new pebble is put on it by a pebble slide move.

      "Chunk: A type M1 move creates a cycle by adding a black edge. b A type M2 move creates a cycle with a pebble slide move. The vertices are labeled according to their role in the definition of the moves. Figure 5 a and Figure 5 b show examples of M1 and M2 map graph creation moves, respectively, in a 2,0 pebble game construction. We next show that if a graph has a pebble game construction, then it has a canonical peb ble game construction. This is done in two steps, considering the cases M1 and M2 sepa rately. The proof gives two constructions that implement the canonical add edge and canonical pebble slide moves. Lemma 14 The canonical add edge move . Let G be a graph with a pebble game construc tion. Cycle creation steps of type M1 can be eliminated in colors ci for 1 i l , where l min . Proof. For add edge moves, cover the edge with a color present on both v and w if possible. If this is not possible, then there are l 1 distinct colors present. Use the highest numbered color to cover the new edge. Remark We note that in the upper range, there is always a repeated color, so no canonical add edge moves create cycles in the upper range. The canonical pebble slide move is defined by a global condition. To prove that we obtain the same class of graphs using only canonical pebble slide moves, we need to extend Lemma 9 to only canonical moves. The main step is to show that if there is any sequence of moves that reorients a path from v to w, then there is a sequence of canonical moves that does the same thing. Lemma 15 The canonical pebble slide move . Any sequence of pebble slide moves leading to an add edge move can be replaced with one that has no M2 steps and allows the same add edge move. In other words, if it is possible to collect l 1 pebbles on the ends of an edge to be added, then it is possible to do this without creating any monochromatic cycles. 12 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the construction used in the proof of Lemma 15. We call this the shortcut construction by analogy to matroid union and intersection augmenting paths used in previous work on the lower range. Figure 6 shows the structure of the proof. The shortcut construction removes an M2 step at the beginning of a sequence that reorients a path from v to w with pebble slides. Since one application of the shortcut construction reorients a simple path from a vertex w to w, and a path from v to w is preserved, the shortcut construction can be applied inductively to find the sequence of moves we want. w v a v w b w v w c Fig. 6.

The path from v to w is simple, and the shortcut construction can be applied inductively to it. Proof.

      "Chunk: The evolution of the Earth Moon system based on the dark matter field fluid model Hongjun Pan Department of Chemistry University of North Texas, Denton, Texas 76203, U. S. A. Abstract The evolution of Earth Moon system is described by the dark matter field fluid model with a non Newtonian approach proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth Moon system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the Moon Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche s limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from Earth Moon system data is 4.39 10 22 s 1m 1. This model predicts that the Mars s rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about 4.38 10 22 rad s 2. Key Words. dark matter, fluid, evolution, Earth, Moon, Mars 1 1. Introduction The popularly accepted theory for the formation of the Earth Moon system is that the Moon was formed from debris of a strong impact by a giant planetesimal with the Earth at the close of the planet forming period Hartmann and Davis 1975 . Since the formation of the Earth Moon system, it has been evolving at all time scale. It is well known that the Moon is receding from us and both the Earth s rotation and Moon s rotation are slowing. The popular theory is that the tidal friction causes all those changes based on the conservation of the angular momentum of the Earth Moon system. The situation becomes complicated in describing the past evolution of the Earth Moon system. Because the Moon is moving away from us and the Earth rotation is slowing, this means that the Moon was closer and the Earth rotation was faster in the past. Creationists argue that based on the tidal friction theory, the tidal friction should be stronger and the recessional rate of the Moon should be greater in the past, the distance of the Moon would quickly fall inside the Roche s limit for earth, 15500 km in which the Moon would be torn apart by gravity in 1 to 2 billion years ago. However, geological evidence indicates that the recession of the Moon in the past was slower than the present rate, i. e., the recession has been accelerating with time. Therefore, it must be concluded that tidal friction was very much less in the remote past than we would deduce on the basis of present day observations Stacey 1977 . This was called geological time scale difficulty or Lunar crisis and is one of the main arguments by creationists against the tidal friction theory Brush 1983 . But we have to consider the case carefully in various aspects. One possible scenario is that the Earth has been undergoing dynamic evolution at all time scale since 2 its inception, the geological and physical conditions such as the continent positions and drifting, the crust, surface temperature fluctuation like the glacial snowball effect, etc at remote past could be substantially different from currently, in which the tidal friction could be much less therefore, the receding rate of the Moon could be slower. Various tidal friction models were proposed in the past to describe the evolution of the Earth Moon system to avoid such difficulty or crisis and put the Moon at quite a comfortable distance from Earth at 4.5 billion years ago Hansen 1982, Kagan and Maslova 1994, Ray et al. 1999, Finch 1981, Slichter 1963 . The tidal friction theories explain that the present rate of tidal dissipation\n",

      "Chunk: is anomalously high because the tidal force is close to a resonance in the response function of ocean Brush 1983 . Kagan gave a detailed review about those tidal friction models Kagan 1997 . Those models are based on many assumptions about geological continental position and drifting and physical conditions in the past, and many parameters such as phase lag angle, multi mode approximation with time dependent frequencies of the resonance modes, etc. have to be introduced and carefully adjusted to make their predictions close to the geological evidence. However, those assumptions and parameters are still challenged, to certain extent, as concoction. The second possible scenario is that another mechanism could dominate the evolution of the Earth Moon system and the role of the tidal friction is not significant. In the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society, University of California at Riverside, the author proposed a dark matter field fluid model Pan 2005 with a non Newtonian approach, the current Moon and Earth data agree with this model very well. This paper will demonstrate that the past evolution of Moon Earth system can be described by the dark matter field fluid model without any assumptions 3 about past geological and physical conditions. Although the subject of the evolution of the Earth Moon system has been extensively studied analytically or numerically, to the author s knowledge, there are no theories similar or equivalent to this model. 2. Invisible matter In modern cosmology, it was proposed that the visible matter in the universe is about 2 10 of the total matter and about 90 98 of total matter is currently invisible which is called dark matter and dark energy, such invisible matter has an anti gravity property to make the universe expanding faster and faster. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, the evolution of the universe should be dominated by the physical mechanism of such invisible matter, such physical mechanism could be far beyond the current Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics, and the Newtonian physics and Einsteinian physics could reflect only a corner of the iceberg of the greater physics. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, it should be more reasonable to think that such dominant invisible matter spreads in everywhere of the universe the density of the invisible matter may vary from place to place in other words, all visible matter objects should be surrounded by such invisible matter and the motion of the visible matter objects should be affected by the invisible matter if there are interactions between the visible matter and the invisible matter. If the ratio of the matter components of the universe is close to this hypothesis, then, the size of the particles of the invisible matter should be very small and below the 4 detection limit of the current technology otherwise, it would be detected long time ago with such dominant amount. With such invisible matter in mind, we move to the next section to develop the dark matter field fluid model with non Newtonian approach. For simplicity, all invisible matter dark matter, dark energy and possible other terms is called dark matter here. 3. The dark matter field fluid model In this proposed model, it is assumed that 1. A celestial body rotates and moves in the space, which, for simplicity, is uniformly filled with the dark matter which is in quiescent state relative to the motion of the celestial body. The dark matter possesses a field property and a fluid property it can interact with the celestial body with its fluid and field properties therefore, it can have energy exchange with the celestial body, and affect the motion of the celestial body. 2. The fluid property follows the general principle of fluid mechanics. The dark matter field fluid particles\n",

      "Chunk: may be so small that they can easily permeate into ordinary baryonic matter i. e., ordinary matter objects could be saturated with such dark matter field fluid. Thus, the whole celestial body interacts with the dark matter field fluid, in the manner of a sponge moving thru water. The nature of the field property of the dark matter field fluid is unknown. It is here assumed that the interaction of the field associated with the dark matter field fluid with the celestial body is proportional to the mass of the celestial body. The dark matter field fluid is assumed to have a repulsive force against the gravitational force towards baryonic matter. The nature and mechanism of such repulsive force is unknown. 5 With the assumptions above, one can study how the dark matter field fluid may influence the motion of a celestial body and compare the results with observations. The common shape of celestial bodies is spherical. According to Stokes s law, a rigid non permeable sphere moving through a quiescent fluid with a sufficiently low Reynolds number experiences a resistance force F rv F , r is the radius of the sphere, and is the fluid viscosity constant. The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 1 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. For a rigid sphere moving through the dark matter field fluid, due to the dual properties of the dark matter field fluid and its permeation into the sphere, the force F may not be proportional to the radius of the sphere. Also, F may be proportional to the mass of the sphere due to the field interaction. Therefore, with the combined effects of both fluid and field, the force exerted on the sphere by the dark matter field fluid is assumed to be of the scaled form mv r F where n is a parameter arising from saturation by dark matter field fluid, the r1 n can be viewed as the effective radius with the same unit as r, m is the mass of the sphere, and is the dark matter field fluid constant, which is equivalent to . The direction of the resistance force F in Eq. 2 is opposite to the direction of the velocity v. The force described by Eq. 2 is velocity dependent and causes negative acceleration. According to Newton s second law of motion, the equation of motion for the sphere is mv r dt dv m Then 6 exp 1 0 vt r v v 6 where v0 is the initial velocity of the sphere. If the sphere revolves around a massive gravitational center, there are three forces in the line between the sphere and the gravitational center the gravitational force, the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force of the dark matter field fluid. The drag force in Eq. 3 reduces the orbital velocity and causes the sphere to move inward to the gravitational center. However, if the sum of the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force is stronger than the gravitational force, then, the sphere will move outward and recede from the gravitational center. This is the case of interest here. If the velocity change in Eq. 3 is sufficiently slow and the repulsive force is small compared to the gravitational force and centripetal acceleration force, then the rate of receding will be accordingly relatively slow. Therefore, the gravitational force and the centripetal acceleration force can be approximately treated in equilibrium at any time. The pseudo equilibrium equation is R mv R GMm 2 , M is the mass of the gravitational center, and R is the radius of the orbit. Inserting v of Eq. 4 into Eq. 5 yields 12 exp 1 2 0 t r v GM R or 12 exp 1 0 t r R R where 2 0 0 v GM . Note that R exponentially increases with time.\n",

      "Chunk: The increase of orbital energy with the receding comes from the repulsive force of dark matter field fluid. The recessional rate of the sphere is R r dt dR The acceleration of the recession is R r dt R d n 2 1 2 2 . The recessional acceleration is positive and proportional to its distance to the gravitational center, so the recession is faster and faster. According to the mechanics of fluids, for a rigid non permeable sphere rotating about its central axis in the quiescent fluid, the torque T exerted by the fluid on the sphere is 3 8 r is the angular velocity of the sphere. The direction of the torque in Eq. 11 is opposite to the direction of the rotation. In the case of a sphere rotating in the quiescent dark matter field fluid with angular velocity , similar to Eq. 2, the proposed T exerted on the sphere is m r T n 3 1 . 12 is opposite to the direction of the rotation. The torque causes the negative angular acceleration dt d I T where I is the moment of inertia of the sphere in the dark matter field fluid 8 2 1 5 2 n r m , the equation of rotation for the sphere in the dark matter field fluid is n r dt 20 exp 1 0 t r where 0 is the initial angular velocity. One can see that the angular velocity of the sphere exponentially decreases with time and the angular deceleration is proportional to its angular velocity. For the same celestial sphere, combining Eq. 9 and Eq. 15 yields 67 .1 3 5 1 dt dR R dt d The significance of Eq. 17 is that it contains only observed data without assumptions and undetermined parameters therefore, it is a critical test for this model.

      "Chunk: arXiv 0704.0004v1 math.CO 31 Mar 2007 A Determinant of Stirling Cycle Numbers Counts Unlabeled Acyclic Single Source Automata DAVID CALLAN Department of Statistics University of Wisconsin Madison 1300 University Ave Madison, WI 53706 1532 callan stat.wisc.edu March 30, 2007 Abstract We show that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic single source automata. The proof involves a bijection from these automata to certain marked lattice paths and a sign reversing involution to evaluate the deter minant. 1 Introduction The chief purpose of this paper is to show bijectively that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic single source automata. Specifically, let Ak n denote the kn kn matrix with i, j entry i 1 k 2 i 1 k 1 i j , where i j is the Stirling cycle number, the number of permutations on i with j cycles. For example, 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 11 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 11 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 10 35 50 24 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 10 35 50 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 15 85 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 15 . 1 As evident in the example, Ak n is formed from k copies of each of rows 2 through n 1 of the Stirling cycle triangle, arranged so that the first nonzero entry in each row is a 1 and, after the first row, this 1 occurs just before the main diagonal in other words, Ak n is a Hessenberg matrix with 1s on the infra diagonal. We will show Main Theorem. The determinant of Ak n is the number of unlabeled acyclic single source automata with n transient states on a k 1 letter input alphabet. Section 2 reviews basic terminology for automata and recurrence relations to count finite acyclic automata. Section 3 introduces column marked subdiagonal paths, which play an intermediate role, and a way to code them. Section 4 presents a bijection from these column marked subdiagonal paths to unlabeled acyclic single source automata. Fi nally, Section 5 evaluates det Ak n using a sign reversing involution and shows that the determinant counts the codes for column marked subdiagonal paths. 2 Automata A complete, deterministic automaton consists of a set of states and an input alphabet whose letters transform the states among themselves a letter and a state produce another state possibly the same one . A finite automaton finite set of states, finite input alphabet of, say, k letters can be represented as a k regular directed multigraph with ordered edges the vertices represent the states and the first, second, . . . edge from a vertex give the effect of the first, second, . . . alphabet letter on that state. A finite automaton cannot be acyclic in the usual sense of no cycles pick a vertex and follow any path from it. This path must ultimately hit a previously encountered vertex, thereby creating a cycle. So the term acyclic is used in the looser sense that only one vertex, called the sink, is involved in cycles. This means that all edges from the sink loop back to itself and may safely be omitted and all other paths feed into the sink. A non sink state is called transient. The size of an acyclic automaton is the number of transient states. An acyclic automaton of size n thus has transient states which we label 1, 2, . . ., n and a sink, labeled n 1.

      "Chunk: the following recurrence relation for the number ak n 2 of acyclic automata of size n on a k letter input alphabet k 1 ak n n 1 X 1 n j 1 n j j 1 k n j ak j , n 1. A source is a vertex with no incoming edges. A finite acyclic automaton has at least one source because a path traversed backward v1 v2 v3 . . . must have distinct vertices and so cannot continue indefinitely. An automaton is single source or initially connected if it has only one source. Let Bk n denote the set of single source acyclic finite SAF automata on a k letter input alphabet with vertices 1, 2, . . ., n 1 where 1 is the source and n 1 is the sink, and set bk n Bk n . The two line representation of an automaton in Bk n is the 2 kn matrix whose columns list the edges in order. For example, ! is in B3 and the source to sink paths in B include 1 a 2 a 6, 1 b 4 c 3 a 6, 1 b 4 b 5 b 2 b 6, where the alphabet is . Proposition 1. The number bk n of SAF automata of size n on a k letter input alphabet n, k 1 is given by bk n n X 1 n i n 1 i 1 i 1 k n i ak i Remark This formula is a bit more succinct than the the recurrence in 1, Theorem 3.2 . Proof Consider the set A of acyclic automata with transient vertices n in which 1 is a source. Call 2, 3, . . ., n the interior vertices. For X 2, n , let f X automata in A whose set of interior vertices includes X, g X automata in A whose set of interior vertices is precisely X. Then f X P Y X Y 2,n g Y and by M obius inversion on the lattice of subsets of 2, n , g X P Y X Y 2,n X, Y f Y where X, Y is the M obius function for this 3 lattice. Since X, Y 1 Y X if X Y , we have in particular that g X Y 2,n 1 Y f Y . Let Y n i so that 1 i n. When Y consists entirely of sources, the vertices in n 1 Y and their incident edges form a subautomaton with i transient states there are ak i such. Also, all edges from the n i vertices comprising Y go directly into n 1 Y i 1 k n i choices. Thus f Y i 1 k n i ak i . By definition, g is the number of automata in A for which 1 is the only source, that is, g bk n and the Proposition now follows from . An unlabeled SAF automaton is an equivalence class of SAF automata under relabeling of the interior vertices. Liskovets notes and we prove below that Bk n has no nontrivial automorphisms, that is, each of the n 1 ! relabelings of the interior vertices of B Bk n produces a different automaton. So unlabeled SAF automata of size n on a k letter alphabet are counted by 1 n 1 !bk n . The next result establishes a canonical representative in each relabeling class. Proposition 2. Each equivalence class in Bk n under relabeling of interior vertices has size n 1 ! and contains exactly one SAF automaton with the last occurrences increas ing property the last occurrences of the interior vertices 2, 3, . . ., n in the bottom row of its two line representation occur in that order.

      "Chunk: B bk n can be distinguished intrinsically, that is, independent of their labeling. To see this, first mark the source, namely 1, with a mark new label v1 and observe that there exists at least one interior vertex whose only incoming edge s are from the source the only currently marked vertex for otherwise a cycle would be present. For each such interior vertex v, choose the last edge from the marked vertex to v using the built in ordering of these edges. This determines an order on these vertices mark them in order v2, v3, . . . , vj j 2 . If there still remain unmarked interior vertices, at least one of them has incoming edges only from a marked vertex or again a cycle would be present. For each such vertex, use the last incoming edge from a marked vertex, where now edges are arranged in order of initial vertex vi with the built in order breaking ties, to order and 4 mark these vertices vj 1, vj 2, . . .. Proceed similarly until all interior vertices are marked. For example, for ! , , namely 4, whose only incoming edge is from the source, and so . Now all incoming edges to both 3 and 5 are from marked vertices and the last such edges built in order comes into play are 4 b 5 and 4 c 3 putting vertices 3, 5 in the order 5, 3. So 3. Finally, . This proves the first assertion.

      "Chunk: bi i k for all i b1b2 . . . bkn, because the summand b1b2 . . . bkn is the number of ways to insert the s in the underlying path coded by bi kn . It is also possible to obtain a recurrence for C k n, p , and then, using Prop. 1, to show analytically that C k n, n Ck 1 n . However, it is much more pleasant to give a bijection and in the next section we will do so. In particular, the number of SAF automata on a 2 letter alphabet is C2 n C 1 n, n X 1 b1 b2 ... bn bi i for all i b1b2 . . . 1, 3, 16, 127, 1363, . . . n 1, 6 sequence A082161 in . 4 Bijection from Paths to Automata In this section we exhibit a bijection from C k n, n to Ck 1 n . Using the illustrated path as a working example with 4, b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b 0,0 8,4 1 2x first construct the top row of a two line representation consisting of k 1 each 1s, 2s, . . . , n s and number them left to right 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 5 2 6 2 7 3 8 3 9 3 10 4 11 4 12 4 . The last step in the path is necessarily an N step. For the second last, third last,. . . N steps in the path, count the number of steps following it. This gives a sequence i1, i2, . . . , in 1 satisfying 1 . . . in 1 and ij k 1 j for all j. Circle the positions i1, i2, . . . , in 1 in the two line representation and then insert in boldface 2, 3, . . ., n in the second row in the circled positions 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 5 2 6 2 7 3 8 3 9 3 10 4 11 4 12 4 2 3 4 . These will be the last occurrences of 2, 3, . . ., n in the second row. Working from the last column in the path back to the first, fill in the blanks in the second row left to right as follows. Count the number of squares from the up to the path including the square 7 and add this number to the nearest boldface number to the left of the current blank entry if there are no boldface numbers to the left, add this number to 1 and insert the result in the current blank square. In the example the numbers of squares are 2,3,1,2,1,2,1,1 yielding 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 5 2 6 2 7 3 8 3 9 3 10 4 11 4 12 4 2 4 5 3 3 5 4 5 4 5 5 . This will fill all blank entries except the last. Note that s in the bottom row correspond to sink that is, n 1 labels in the second row. Finally, insert n 1 into the last remaining blank space to give the image automaton 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 2 4 5 3 3 5 4 5 4 5 5 5 ! .

      "Chunk: n is the total weight of certain lists of permutations, each list carrying weight 1. Then a weight reversing involution cancels all 1 weights and reduces the problem to counting the surviving lists. These surviving lists are essentially the codes for paths in C 1 n, p , and the Main Theorem follows from 4. To describe the permutations giving a nonzero contribution to det A n P sgn Qn , i , define the code of a permutation on n to be the list ci n i i 1 . Since the i, j entry of A n , i 1 2i j , is 0 unless j i 1, we must have i i 1 for all i. It is well known that there are 2n 1 such permutations, corresponding to compositions of n, with codes characterized by the following four conditions i ci 0 for all i, ii c1 1, iii each ci 1 is immediately followed by ci 1 zeros in the list, iv Pn n. Let us call such a list a padded composition of n deleting the zeros is a bijection to ordinary compositions of n. For example, 3, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0 is a padded 8 composition of 6. For a permutation with padded composition code c, the nonzero entries in c give the cycle lengths of . Hence sgn , which is the parity of n cycles in , is given by 1 0s in c. We have det A n P sgn Qn , i P sgn Qn i 1 2i i , and so det A n X c 1 0s in c n Y i 1 i 1 ci where the sum is restricted to padded compositions c of n with ci i for all i A002083 because i 1 i 1 ci 0 unless ci i. Henceforth, let us write all permutations in standard cycle form whereby the smallest entry occurs first in each cycle and these smallest entries increase left to right. Thus, with dashes separating cycles, 154 2 36 is the standard cycle form of the permutation 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 2 6 1 4 3 . We define a nonfirst entry to be one that does not start a cycle. Thus the preceding permutation has 3 nonfirst entries 5,4,6. Note that the number of nonfirst entries is 0 only for the identity permutation. We denote an identity permutation of any size by o . By definition of Stirling cycle number, the product in counts lists i n i is a permutation on i 1 with i 1 ci cycles, equivalently, with ci i nonfirst entries. So define Ln to be the set all lists of permutations i n i is a permutation on i 1 , nonfirst entries in i is i, 1 is the transposition 1,2 , each nonidentity permutation i is immediately followed by ci 1 o s where ci 1 is the number of nonfirst entries in i so the total number of nonfirst entries is n . Assign a weight to Ln by wt 1 o s in . Then det A n X Ln wt . We now define a weight reversing involution on most of Ln. Given Ln, scan the list of its component permutations 1, 2 , 2, 3, . . . left to right. Stop at the first one that either i has more than one nonfirst entry, or ii has only one nonfirst entry, b say, and . Say k is the permutation where we stop. 9 In case i decrement i.e. decrease by 1 the number of o s in the list by splitting k into two nonidentity permutations as follows. Let m be the largest nonfirst entry of k and let lbe its predecessor. Replace k and its successor in the list necessarily an o by the following two permutations\n",

      "Chunk: seen, for some simple examples such as a free particle and the harmonic oscillator one indeed recovers the Schr odinger description back. For other sys tems, such as quantum cosmological models, the answer is not as clear, since the structure of the space of classi cal solutions is such that the effective description intro duced by the polymer regularization at different scales is qualitatively different from the original dynamics. A proper treatment of these class of systems is underway and will be reported elsewhere . Perhaps the most important lesson that we have learned here is that there indeed exists a rich inter play between the polymer description and the ordinary Schr odinger representation. The full structure of such re lation still needs to be unravelled. We can only hope that a full understanding of these issues will shed some light in the ultimate goal of treating the quantum dynamics of background independent field systems such as general relativity.

The Serpens YSO Population As Observed With IRAC and MIPS Paul Harvey1, Bruno Mer n2, Tracy L. Huard3, Luisa M. Rebull4, Nicholas Chapman5, Neal J. Evans II1, Philip C. Myers3 ABSTRACT We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy observations of the Serpens star forming region. In particular we present a set of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO s, from the extensive background contamination by extra galactic objects. We then discuss the prop erties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO s. We find 235 such objects in the 0.85 deg2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO s outside this area is identified from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. To understand the properties of the circumstellar material that produces the observed infrared emission, we describe two sets of results, the use of color color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with those of theoretical models for star disk envelope systems and our own modeling of the subset of our objects that appear to be well represented by a stellar photosphere plus circumstellar disk. These objects exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO s in Serpens extends down to at least a few 10 3 L or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc. The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO s from extra galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO s at very low luminosities. We find no evidence for 1Astronomy Department, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station C1400, Austin, TX 78712 0259 pmh astro.as.utexas.edu, nje astro.as.utexas.edu 2Research and Scientific Support Dept., ESTEC ESA , Keplerlaan, 1, PO Box 299, 2200 AG Noord wijk, The Netherlands and Leiden Observatory, Leiden University, Postbus 9513, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands bmerin rssd.esa.int 3Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, 60 Garden Street, MS42, Cambridge, MA 02138 thuard cfa.harvard.edu, pmyers cfa.harvard.edu 4Spitzer Science Center, MC 220 6, Pasadena, CA 91125 rebull ipac.caltech.edu 5Astronomy Department, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742 chapman astro.umd.edu 2 variability in the shorter IRAC bands between the two epochs of our data set, t 6 hours. A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less evolved YSO s are more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background extra galactic population can be fit by the same two point correlation function as seen in other extra galactic studies. We also present a table of matches between several previous infrared and X ray studies of the Serpens YSO population and our Spitzer data set. The clusters in Serpens have a very high surface density of YSOs, primarily with SEDs suggesting extreme youth. The total number of YSOs, mostly Class II, is greater in the region outside the clusters. Subject headings infrared general clouds star forming regions 1. Introduction The Serpens star forming cloud is one of five such large clouds selected for observation as part of The Spitzer Legacy project From Molecular Cores to Planet forming Disks c2d Evans et al. 2003 . Previous papers in this series have described the observational results in the Serpens Cloud as seen with IRAC Harvey et. al. 2006 Paper I and MIPS Harvey et al. 2007 as well as observations of the more distant clouds Taurus, Ophiuchus and Perseus. These papers focus on the results of the Spitzer observations of the circumstellar material that produces the observed infrared emission and the observed properties of the young stellar objects. In this paper we focus primarily on the YSO population and derive properties of the star forming environment of the core that produces them. We make use of the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy observations of the Serpens star forming region to construct catalogs of source properties and identify a set of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSOs. We then discuss the spatial and spectral properties of the YSO population and compare the derived results with the properties of YSOs in other nearby environments.\n",
