# Notes on whatevere experiments you do goes here


## Experimenting with different pdf-to-text parsers

- [x] pymupdf (raw)
- [x] pymupdf (OCR) with tessaract
- [x] pdftotext (debian utility)
     - best one so far
- [ ] A pre-trained OCR from huggingface
     - hypothetically we could host this pre-trained model locally on a GPU and parse pdfs in bulk.
