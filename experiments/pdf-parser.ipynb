Introduction\\nIn R-Parity conserving SUSY events at hadron colliders SUSY particles (\\xe2\\x80\\x98sparticles\\xe2\\x80\\x99) must\\nbe pair-produced and undergo cascade decay to the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle\\n(LSP), which is often invisible and hence a dark matter candidate. The presence of two\\nsuch invisible particles in the \\xef\\xac\\x81nal state, together with imperfect detector hermeticity close\\nto the beam-pipe and an uncertain parton centre-of-mass energy, prevents the use of con-\\nventional invariant mass or transverse mass techniques for sparticle mass measurement.\\nSimilar challenges are faced when attempting to measure the mass of any pair-produced\\nparticles with visible and invisible decay products.\\nSeveral approaches to this general problem have been documented, usually in the con-\\ntext of measuring SUSY particle masses. Given a su\\xef\\xac\\x83ciently long decay chain constraints\\non analytical combinations of sparticle masses can be obtained from the positions of end-\\npoints in distributions of invariant masses of combinations of visible SUSY decay products\\n(jets, leptons etc.) [1]. Given a number of such constraints, the system of equations may be\\nsolved with a numerical \\xef\\xac\\x81t to obtain the individual masses [1, 2, 3]. It was recently shown\\nthat the mass precision obtained from this technique can be improved by subsequently per-\\nforming combined \\xef\\xac\\x81ts to individual events, imposing both experiment end-point constraints\\nand event Emiss\\nT\\nconstraints [4].\\nWhen the number of kinematic end-point constraints provided by a given decay chain\\nis insu\\xef\\xac\\x83cient to fully constrain individual sparticle masses alternative techniques must be\\nemployed. One possible approach involves solving simultaneously the mass-shell conditions\\nobtained from several events containing the same decay chain [5].\\nThis mass-relation\\nmethod exploits the small widths of SUSY states, allowing the mass of each state appearing\\nin the considered events to be assumed to be constant.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n'\n",
      "b'A second approach to this problem is to select events in which the same decay chain\\nappears in both \\xe2\\x80\\x98legs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of each selected event. In this case additional constraints are pro-\\nvided by the components of the event ETmiss vector1, and again use can be made of the\\nsparticle narrow-width approximation to equate the masses in the two legs. This permits\\nthe construction of further distributions with kinematic end-points related to the masses\\nof sparticles present in the event.\\nOne example of a technique of this kind is the stransverse mass method [6, 2, 7]. Con-\\nsider two identical heavy SUSY states \\xce\\xb41 and \\xce\\xb42, decaying respectively to visible products\\nv1 and v2 and identical lighter states \\xce\\xb11 and \\xce\\xb12. If pT(\\xce\\xb11), the transverse momentum\\nvector of \\xce\\xb11, were known then it would be possible to calculate mT (\\xce\\xb41), the transverse\\nmass of \\xce\\xb41, which is bounded from above by m(\\xce\\xb4). If pT(\\xce\\xb11) is known however then so is\\npT(\\xce\\xb12) through application of the event ETmiss constraints. Therefore mT (\\xce\\xb42) could also\\nbe calculated, a quantity which must also be less than m(\\xce\\xb4). Consequently the maximum\\nvalue of mT (\\xce\\xb41) and mT (\\xce\\xb42) provides a variable with an end-point whose position measures\\nm(\\xce\\xb4). Of course in reality we are not able to measure pT(\\xce\\xb11) or pT(\\xce\\xb12) however the great\\ninsight of Ref. [6] was the realisation that if we can \\xef\\xac\\x81nd a test value pT(\\xce\\xb11) which minimises\\nthis maximum transverse mass, we can be sure that the minimised-maximised transverse\\nmass is also bounded from above by m(\\xce\\xb4). This \\xe2\\x80\\x98minimax\\xe2\\x80\\x99 transverse mass quantity is\\nreferred to as the \\xe2\\x80\\x98stransverse mass\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or MT2.\\nThe development of the stransverse mass technique was particularly important because\\nfor the \\xef\\xac\\x81rst time it allowed the measurement of masses of sparticles decaying through very\\nshort cascades, for instance \\xcb\\x9cqR \\xe2\\x86\\x92q \\xcb\\x9c\\xcf\\x870\\n1 or \\xcb\\x9cl \\xe2\\x86\\x92l\\xcb\\x9c\\xcf\\x870\\n1. Furthermore an analytical expression\\nfor MT2 has recently been derived, valid in cases where the centre-of-mass (CoM) frame\\nis at rest in the laboratory transverse plane [8], thus simplifying its use considerably. The\\ntechnique inherits one draw-back from its use of the transverse masses of \\xce\\xb4 decay products\\nhowever, namely that it requires the use of m(\\xce\\xb1) as an input.\\nMT2 may therefore be\\ndescribed more correctly as an ensemble of variables, one for each assumed value for the\\nunknown quantity m(\\xce\\xb1). The dependence of MT2 on m(\\xce\\xb1) has been determined to be\\napproximately m(\\xce\\xb4) \\xe2\\x88\\x92m(\\xce\\xb1) in speci\\xef\\xac\\x81c cases [7], however it would in general be preferable\\nif the de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition of the variable were independent of the unknown quantities to be measured.\\nIn that case the mass constraints obtained from an end-point \\xef\\xac\\x81t would be uncorrelated with\\nother measurements and hence could be used as input to a global mass \\xef\\xac\\x81t.\\nIn this paper we will propose a very simple technique which seeks to address the same\\nproblem as the stransverse mass technique, but which approaches the problem from a\\ndi\\xef\\xac\\x80erent perspective. The new technique will allow a simple analytical combination of par-\\nticle/sparticle masses to be constrained in a precise and model-independent manner. Fur-\\nthermore the technique will o\\xef\\xac\\x80er at least in principle the prospect of measuring individual\\nparticle masses, as postulated for the stransverse mass technique in Refs. [9, 10, 11, 12].\\nThe new technique will be applicable to any class of events in which heavy particles of\\nunknown mass are pair-produced and decay to semi-invisible \\xef\\xac\\x81nal states.\\n1We denote three-vector and two-vector quantities with bold case, while the corresponding magnitudes\\nare denoted with standard case. Four-vector quantities are written in standard case.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 2 \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n'\n",
      "b'The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 will describe the principles underlying\\nthe technique and investigate the properties of the new variable upon which it is based.\\nSection 3 will illustrate application of the technique to the problem of constraining sparticle\\nmass combinations with \\xcb\\x9cqR \\xe2\\x86\\x92q \\xcb\\x9c\\xcf\\x870\\n1 pair events at the LHC. Section 4 will outline extension\\nof the technique to measurement of individual particle masses. Section 5 will conclude and\\ndiscuss avenues for future work.\\n2. Description of technique\\n2.1 Background\\nConsider \\xe2\\x80\\x98symmetric\\xe2\\x80\\x99 events in which identical cascade decay chains of the form\\n\\xce\\xb4 \\xe2\\x86\\x92\\xce\\xb1v\\n(2.1)\\noccur in each leg i of the event. We shall refer to the initial particles produced in the hard\\nscattering as \\xce\\xb4i. We shall further consider n step decay chains in each leg consisting of\\nn \\xe2\\x88\\x921 decays, such that the (n \\xe2\\x88\\x921)th decays produce invisible particles \\xce\\xb1i. The visible\\nproducts of decays 1 to (n \\xe2\\x88\\x921) in each leg will be considered as single systems vi of mass\\nm(vi) and four-momentum p(vi). We shall assume that no invisible particles other than \\xce\\xb1\\nare produced in the decay chains. The particles \\xce\\xb4i and \\xce\\xb1i have common masses which are\\nrespectively m(\\xce\\xb4) and m(\\xce\\xb1).\\nThis parameterisation of the decay chains is quite general. The case n = 2 corresponds\\nto SUSY chains such as \\xcb\\x9cqR \\xe2\\x86\\x92q \\xcb\\x9c\\xcf\\x870\\n1 or \\xcb\\x9cl \\xe2\\x86\\x92l\\xcb\\x9c\\xcf\\x870\\n1, with \\xce\\xb1 identi\\xef\\xac\\x81ed as the LSP \\xcb\\x9c\\xcf\\x870\\n1. In these\\ncases m2(vi) << p2(vi) at the LHC. For longer SUSY chains we can choose the number\\nof decays provided we can unambiguously identify the visible products of those decays.\\nIf n is equal to the total number of sparticles in the chain then \\xce\\xb1 is again the LSP. For\\nchains with n > 2 steps the distributions of invariant masses m(vi) can display kinematic\\nend-points sensitive to analytical combinations of sparticle masses appearing in the chain\\n[1]. This information is used to constrain the individual masses in the end-point method\\nbut will be incidental to the technique described here.\\nConsider now the use of N symmetric events of the general form of Eqn. 2.1 to mea-\\nsure m(\\xce\\xb4) and m(\\xce\\xb1). This problem reduces to one of solving 6N non-linear simultaneous\\nequations, with each event providing the mass-shell conditions:\\n[p(v1) + p(\\xce\\xb11)]2 = [p(v2) + p(\\xce\\xb12)]2 = m2(\\xce\\xb4),\\n[p(\\xce\\xb11)]2 = [p(\\xce\\xb12)]2 = m2(\\xce\\xb1),\\n(2.2)\\ntogether with two ETmiss constraints:\\npx(\\xce\\xb11) + px(\\xce\\xb12) = Emiss\\nx\\n,\\npy(\\xce\\xb11) + py(\\xce\\xb12) = Emiss\\ny\\n.\\n(2.3)\\nEach event contributes 2 unknown masses, which are common to all events, and 8 unknown\\n\\xce\\xb1i four-momentum components, which di\\xef\\xac\\x80er between events. The total number of unknown\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 3 \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n'\n",
      "b'parameters is therefore 8N + 2 while the number of constraints is 6N and so the system\\nof equations is highly under-constrained.\\nIt may seem surprising at \\xef\\xac\\x81rst that the above system of equations can be solved at all,\\nhowever it should be noticed that we are not concerned with measuring the four-momenta\\np(\\xce\\xb11) and p(\\xce\\xb12) for all events, but rather with measuring only the common masses m(\\xce\\xb4)\\nand m(\\xce\\xb1) using at least one event.\\nConsequently we may set out to discard events in\\nwhich the unknown masses depend on unknown four-momentum components. The problem\\ntherefore reduces to one of \\xef\\xac\\x81nding variables dependent only on the measurable quantities\\np(v1), p(v2) and ETmiss which identify events where the masses also depend only on those\\nmeasurable quantities. This general approach is e\\xef\\xac\\x80ectively that taken by kinematic end-\\npoint techniques, in which the variables identifying the events, such as m(ll) or MT2, are\\nalso those which provide the mass measurment. This is also the approach which shall be\\ntaken here.\\n2.2 Transverse momentum end-points\\nOne possible starting point for this problem was outlined in Ref. [13]. In an e\\xef\\xac\\x80ective two-\\nbody decay process of the type considered above the magnitude of the three-momentum\\nof the visible decay products in the rest frame of \\xce\\xb4i is given by\\n|p(vi)| = 1\\n2\\np\\n[m2(\\xce\\xb4) \\xe2\\x88\\x92m2(\\xce\\xb1) + m2(vi)]2 \\xe2\\x88\\x92[2m(\\xce\\xb4)m(vi)]2\\nm(\\xce\\xb4)\\n\\xe2\\x89\\xa11\\n2Mi,\\n(2.4)\\nwhich de\\xef\\xac\\x81nes the 2-body mass parameter Mi. It will also be useful for the discussion\\nwhich follows to de\\xef\\xac\\x81ne the equivalent quantity M0 for the special case where m(vi) = 0:\\nM0 \\xe2\\x89\\xa1m2(\\xce\\xb4) \\xe2\\x88\\x92m2(\\xce\\xb1)\\nm(\\xce\\xb4)\\n.\\n(2.5)\\nIf \\xce\\xb4i has a small boost in the laboratory transverse frame, then the laboratory transverse\\nmomentum of vi is of order Mi/2.\\nThis dependence of the momenta of visible decay\\nproducts on the masses of heavy particles further up the decay chain is the reason that\\nvariables such as the \\xe2\\x80\\x98e\\xef\\xac\\x80ective mass\\xe2\\x80\\x99 [1] used in SUSY studies are sensitive to such masses.\\nIn principle we can improve on the use of ad hoc variables such as the e\\xef\\xac\\x80ective mass\\nhowever. In the rest frame of \\xce\\xb4i the magnitude of the momentum of vi transverse to the\\nbeam direction 2, pT (vi), is bounded from above by Mi/2 because\\npT (vi) = Mi\\n2 sin \\xcf\\x88i,\\n(2.6)\\nwhere \\xcf\\x88i is the polar decay angle relative to the beam direction. Consequently if we could\\nmeasure pT (vi) we could constrain the masses.\\nUnfortunately however we are not able to measure pT (vi) directly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 instead we measure\\nthe equivalent quantity in the laboratory frame: p\\xe2\\x80\\xb2\\nT (vi). To proceed further we assume\\n2We denote quantities measured in the \\xce\\xb41\\xce\\xb42 CoM frame with primed variables and those measured in\\nthe rest frames of \\xce\\xb41 or \\xce\\xb42 with unprimed variables.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 4 \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n'\n",
      "b'that the \\xce\\xb41\\xce\\xb42 CoM frame is at rest in the laboratory transverse plane. This condition can\\nbe enforced by selecting events in which the net transverse momentum of the \\xef\\xac\\x81nal state\\nexcluding the \\xce\\xb41 and \\xce\\xb42 decay products is small. In this case p\\xe2\\x80\\xb2\\nT (vi) is related to pT (vi) by\\na proper Lorentz transformation in the transverse plane through the well-known relation:\\np\\xe2\\x80\\xb22\\nT (vi) =\\n1\\n1 \\xe2\\x88\\x92\\xce\\xb22 [pT(vi) cos \\xcf\\x86i \\xc2\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2E(vi)]2 + p2\\nT (vi) sin2 \\xcf\\x86i,\\n(2.7)\\nwhere \\xce\\xb2 is the transverse boost factor (0 < \\xce\\xb2 < 1), E(vi) is the energy of vi and \\xcf\\x86i is the\\nangle in the rest frame of \\xce\\xb4i between the boost direction and pT(vi). For given vi we know\\nneither \\xce\\xb2 nor \\xcf\\x86i and hence we are not able to reconstruct pT (vi). Nevertheless we do know\\nfrom conservation of momentum that in the \\xce\\xb41\\xce\\xb42 CoM frame, and hence the laboratory\\ntransverse plane, the boost applied to v2 is equal and opposite to that applied to v1.\\nTo proceed further we shall attempt to \\xef\\xac\\x81nd a quantity which can be calculated from\\nthe components of pT(v1) and pT(v2) which remains unchanged if calculated with the\\ncorresponding components of p\\xe2\\x80\\xb2\\nT(v1) and p\\xe2\\x80\\xb2\\nT(v2). If we could \\xef\\xac\\x81nd such a quantity then we\\ncould use it to relate momenta measured in the \\xce\\xb41\\xce\\xb42 CoM frame to those measured in the\\n\\xce\\xb41 and \\xce\\xb42 rest frames and hence constrain Mi.\\n2.3 Cotransverse mass and contransverse mass\\nConsider \\xef\\xac\\x81rst a system containing two particles v1 and v2 with masses m(v1) and m(v2)\\nmeasured in some frame F(0) to have four-momenta p(v1) and p(v2). If both these particles\\nare now measured in a di\\xef\\xac\\x80erent frame F(1) it is well known that the mass obtained from\\np(v1) + p(v2) remains unchanged, i.e. the quantity\\nm2(v1, v2) = [E(v1) + E(v2)]2 \\xe2\\x88\\x92[p(v1) + p(v2)]2\\n= m2(v1) + m2(v2) + 2[E(v1)E(v2) \\xe2\\x88\\x92p(v1) \\xc2\\xb7 p(v2)]\\n(2.8)\\nis invariant. Another way to interpret this is that when particles v1 and v2 are subjected\\nto co-linear boosts of equal magnitude m2(v1, v2) is invariant.\\nNow let us examine what happens when we start from one frame F(0), but boost\\nparticles v1 and v2 to di\\xef\\xac\\x80erent frames F(1) and F(2) respectively. These new frames are\\ndistinguished by the fact that their boosts are of equal magnitude but opposite direction in\\nframe F(0). In other words particles v1 and v2 are subjected to contra-linear boosts of equal\\nmagnitude. Clearly m2(v1, v2) is no longer an invariant \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this can be seen for instance by\\nconsidering p(v1) = \\xe2\\x88\\x92p(v2) in which case E(v1) + E(v2) increases with increasing \\xce\\xb2 while\\np(v1) + p(v2) remains zero.\\nConsider now a new quantity MC equivalent to the invariant mass obtained from\\np(v1) + P(p(v2)) where P is the standard parity transformation operator:\\nM2\\nC(v1, v2) \\xe2\\x89\\xa1[E(v1) + E(v2)]2 \\xe2\\x88\\x92[p(v1) \\xe2\\x88\\x92p(v2)]2\\n= m2(v1) + m2(v2) + 2[E(v1)E(v2) + p(v1) \\xc2\\xb7 p(v2)].\\n(2.9)\\nThis quantity is invariant under the contra-linear boosts considered above.

Extension to measurement of individual particle masses\\nSo far we have shown that we can obtain an end-point in the distribution of a quantity\\ncalculated from visible decay product transverse momenta which depends on an analytical\\ncombination of masses. In principle it is possible to use the position of this end-point to\\nmeasure the individual masses m(\\xce\\xb4) and m(\\xce\\xb1). The key to this is recognising that Mi\\ndepends upon both the unknown masses m(\\xce\\xb4) and m(\\xce\\xb1) and the visible masses m(vi). If\\none requires that m(v1) = m(v2) = m(v) then it can be shown from Eqns. 2.4 and 2.14\\nthat for given m(v) the bound on MCT is given by:\\nMmax\\nCT\\n=\\n1\\nm(\\xce\\xb4)m2(v) + M0.\\n(4.1)\\nConsequently if events could be found in which m(v1) and m(v2) were non-zero and\\nequal, for instance by accurately combining products from several decays in a multi-step\\nchain, then the position of Mmax\\nCT\\nwould depend linearly on m2(v) with a gradient of\\n1/m(\\xce\\xb4) and intercepting the ordinate at M0. The gradient of a linear \\xef\\xac\\x81t to this bound\\ntherefore measures m(\\xce\\xb4) independently of m(\\xce\\xb1), while the intercept then allows m(\\xce\\xb1) to\\nbe constrained. As an aside it is interesting to note that in this case MCT is also bounded\\nfrom below by:\\nMmin\\nCT\\n= 2\\np\\nm2(v).\\n(4.2)\\nand for exclusive decay chains m2(v) is bounded from above by a separate analytical com-\\nbination of masses identical to that used by the end-point method discussed in Section 1.\\nThe above technique should work in principle however it is likely to be very di\\xef\\xac\\x83cult\\nto implement in practice. The \\xef\\xac\\x81rst di\\xef\\xac\\x83culty is connected with unambiguously associating\\ndecay products with SUSY decay chains. One possible approach would involve focusing\\non speci\\xef\\xac\\x81c exclusive decay chains, using the values of invariant masses of combinations of\\ndecay products to associate decay products to chains [4]. Unfortunately however the low\\nacceptance of such exclusive selections is likely to prevent successful application of this\\ntechnique before signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant quantities of data have been acquired.\\nA second approach involves inclusive selection of SUSY events with multiple visible\\ndecay products, and use of a kinematic algorithm to approximately associate decay products\\nto chains. Fig. 3(left) shows the result of an attempt at applying this approach to SPS1a\\nevents with ISR turned o\\xef\\xac\\x80. Here decay products have been associated to chains by requiring\\nthat max[m2(v1), m2(v2)] is minimised. Events have been selected by requiring four jets\\nand no leptons, and the mass-squared equality requirement mentioned above has been\\nimposed by requiring that the asymmetry in m2(v1) and m2(v2) is less than 10%.

The lower bound on MCT given by\\nEqn. 4.2 is prominent (bottom line).

Conclusions and directions for future work\\nThis paper has shown that by constructing a kinematic quantity invariant under contra-\\nlinear equal magnitude boosts in the laboratory transverse plane a simple analytical com-\\nbination of the masses of pair-produced particles and their invisible decay products can\\nbe constrained at hadron colliders such as the LHC.

This\\napplication is likely to be difficult to realise in practice however due to the contamination\\nof the final state with ISR jets. The technique may be of most use for measurements of\\nSUSY particle masses at the LHC, however the technique should be applicable to any class\\nof hadron collider events in which heavy particles of unknown mass are pair-produced and\\ndecay to semi-invisible final states.\\nKeywords: SUSY, contransverse mass, end-point.\\n'\n",

Introduction\\nIn R-Parity conserving SUSY events at hadron colliders SUSY particles (\\xe2\\x80\\x98sparticles\\xe2\\x80\\x99) must\\nbe pair-produced and undergo cascade decay to the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle\\n(LSP), which is often invisible and hence a dark matter candidate. The presence of two\\nsuch invisible particles in the final state, together with imperfect detector hermeticity close\\nto the beam-pipe and an uncertain parton centre-of-mass energy, prevents the use of con-\\nventional invariant mass or transverse mass techniques for sparticle mass measurement.\\nSimilar challenges are faced when attempting to measure the mass of any pair-produced\\nparticles with visible and invisible decay products.\\nSeveral approaches to this general problem have been documented, usually in the con-\\ntext of measuring SUSY particle masses. Given a sufficiently long decay chain constraints\\non analytical combinations of sparticle masses can be obtained from the positions of end-\\npoints in distributions of invariant masses of combinations of visible SUSY decay products\\n(jets, leptons etc.) [1]. Given a number of such constraints, the system of equations may be\\nsolved with a numerical fit to obtain the individual masses [1, 2, 3]. It was recently shown\\nthat the mass precision obtained from this technique can be improved by subsequently per-\\nforming combined fits to individual events, imposing both experiment end-point constraints\\nand event Emiss\\nT\\nconstraints [4].\\nWhen the number of kinematic end-point constraints provided by a given decay chain\\nis insufficient to fully constrain individual sparticle masses alternative techniques must be\\nemployed. One possible approach involves solving simultaneously the mass-shell conditions\\nobtained from several events containing the same decay chain [5].\\nThis mass-relation\\nmethod exploits the small widths of SUSY states, allowing the mass of each state appearing\\nin the considered events to be assumed to be constant.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n'\n",
      "b'A second approach to this problem is to select events in which the same decay chain\\nappears in both \\xe2\\x80\\x98legs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of each selected event. In this case additional constraints are pro-\\nvided by the components of the event ETmiss vector1, and again use can be made of the\\nsparticle narrow-width approximation to equate the masses in the two legs. This permits\\nthe construction of further distributions with kinematic end-points related to the masses\\nof sparticles present in the event.\\nOne example of a technique of this kind is the stransverse mass method [6, 2, 7]. Con-\\nsider two identical heavy SUSY states \\xce\\xb41 and \\xce\\xb42, decaying respectively to visible products\\nv1 and v2 and identical lighter states \\xce\\xb11 and \\xce\\xb12. If pT(\\xce\\xb11), the transverse momentum\\nvector of \\xce\\xb11, were known then it would be possible to calculate mT (\\xce\\xb41), the transverse\\nmass of \\xce\\xb41, which is bounded from above by m(\\xce\\xb4). If pT(\\xce\\xb11) is known however then so is\\npT(\\xce\\xb12) through application of the event ETmiss constraints. Therefore mT (\\xce\\xb42) could also\\nbe calculated, a quantity which must also be less than m(\\xce\\xb4). Consequently the maximum\\nvalue of mT (\\xce\\xb41) and mT (\\xce\\xb42) provides a variable with an end-point whose position measures\\nm(\\xce\\xb4). Of course in reality we are not able to measure pT(\\xce\\xb11) or pT(\\xce\\xb12) however the great\\ninsight of Ref. [6] was the realisation that if we can find a test value pT(\\xce\\xb11) which minimises\\nthis maximum transverse mass, we can be sure that the minimised-maximised transverse\\nmass is also bounded from above by m(\\xce\\xb4). This \\xe2\\x80\\x98minimax\\xe2\\x80\\x99 transverse mass quantity is\\nreferred to as the \\xe2\\x80\\x98stransverse mass\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or MT2.\\nThe development of the stransverse mass technique was particularly important because\\nfor the first time it allowed the measurement of masses of sparticles decaying through very\\nshort cascades, for instance \\xcb\\x9cqR \\xe2\\x86\\x92q \\xcb\\x9c\\xcf\\x870\\n1 or \\xcb\\x9cl \\xe2\\x86\\x92l\\xcb\\x9c\\xcf\\x870\\n1. Furthermore an analytical expression\\nfor MT2 has recently been derived, valid in cases where the centre-of-mass (CoM) frame\\nis at rest in the laboratory transverse plane [8], thus simplifying its use considerably. The\\ntechnique inherits one draw-back from its use of the transverse masses of \\xce\\xb4 decay products\\nhowever, namely that it requires the use of m(\\xce\\xb1) as an input.\\nMT2 may therefore be\\ndescribed more correctly as an ensemble of variables, one for each assumed value for the\\nunknown quantity m(\\xce\\xb1). The dependence of MT2 on m(\\xce\\xb1) has been determined to be\\napproximately m(\\xce\\xb4) \\xe2\\x88\\x92m(\\xce\\xb1) in specific cases [7], however it would in general be preferable\\nif the definition of the variable were independent of the unknown quantities to be measured.\\nIn that case the mass constraints obtained from an end-point fit would be uncorrelated with\\nother measurements and hence could be used as input to a global mass fit.\\nIn this paper we will propose a very simple technique which seeks to address the same\\nproblem as the stransverse mass technique, but which approaches the problem from a\\ndifferent perspective. The new technique will allow a simple analytical combination of par-\\nticle/sparticle masses to be constrained in a precise and model-independent manner. Fur-\\nthermore the technique will offer at least in principle the prospect of measuring individual\\nparticle masses, as postulated for the stransverse mass technique in Refs. [9, 10, 11, 12].\\nThe new technique will be applicable to any class of events in which heavy particles of\\nunknown mass are pair-produced and decay to semi-invisible final states.\\n1We denote three-vector and two-vector quantities with bold case, while the corresponding magnitudes\\nare denoted with standard case. Four-vector quantities are written in standard case.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 2 \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n'\n",
      "b'The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 will describe the principles underlying\\nthe technique and investigate the properties of the new variable upon which it is based.\\nSection 3 will illustrate application of the technique to the problem of constraining sparticle\\nmass combinations with \\xcb\\x9cqR \\xe2\\x86\\x92q \\xcb\\x9c\\xcf\\x870\\n1 pair events at the LHC. Section 4 will outline extension\\nof the technique to measurement of individual particle masses. Section 5 will conclude and\\ndiscuss avenues for future work.\\n2. Description of technique\\n2.1 Background\\nConsider \\xe2\\x80\\x98symmetric\\xe2\\x80\\x99 events in which identical cascade decay chains of the form\\n\\xce\\xb4 \\xe2\\x86\\x92\\xce\\xb1v\\n(2.1)\\noccur in each leg i of the event. We shall refer to the initial particles produced in the hard\\nscattering as \\xce\\xb4i. We shall further consider n step decay chains in each leg consisting of\\nn \\xe2\\x88\\x921 decays, such that the (n \\xe2\\x88\\x921)th decays produce invisible particles \\xce\\xb1i. The visible\\nproducts of decays 1 to (n \\xe2\\x88\\x921) in each leg will be considered as single systems vi of mass\\nm(vi) and four-momentum p(vi). We shall assume that no invisible particles other than \\xce\\xb1\\nare produced in the decay chains. The particles \\xce\\xb4i and \\xce\\xb1i have common masses which are\\nrespectively m(\\xce\\xb4) and m(\\xce\\xb1).\\nThis parameterisation of the decay chains is quite general. The case n = 2 corresponds\\nto SUSY chains such as \\xcb\\x9cqR \\xe2\\x86\\x92q \\xcb\\x9c\\xcf\\x870\\n1 or \\xcb\\x9cl \\xe2\\x86\\x92l\\xcb\\x9c\\xcf\\x870\\n1, with \\xce\\xb1 identified as the LSP \\xcb\\x9c\\xcf\\x870\\n1. In these\\ncases m2(vi) << p2(vi) at the LHC. For longer SUSY chains we can choose the number\\nof decays provided we can unambiguously identify the visible products of those decays.\\nIf n is equal to the total number of sparticles in the chain then \\xce\\xb1 is again the LSP. For\\nchains with n > 2 steps the distributions of invariant masses m(vi) can display kinematic\\nend-points sensitive to analytical combinations of sparticle masses appearing in the chain\\n[1]. This information is used to constrain the individual masses in the end-point method\\nbut will be incidental to the technique described here.\\nConsider now the use of N symmetric events of the general form of Eqn. 2.1 to mea-\\nsure m(\\xce\\xb4) and m(\\xce\\xb1). This problem reduces to one of solving 6N non-linear simultaneous\\nequations, with each event providing the mass-shell conditions:\\n[p(v1) + p(\\xce\\xb11)]2 = [p(v2) + p(\\xce\\xb12)]2 = m2(\\xce\\xb4),\\n[p(\\xce\\xb11)]2 = [p(\\xce\\xb12)]2 = m2(\\xce\\xb1),\\n(2.2)\\ntogether with two ETmiss constraints:\\npx(\\xce\\xb11) + px(\\xce\\xb12) = Emiss\\nx\\n,\\npy(\\xce\\xb11) + py(\\xce\\xb12) = Emiss\\ny\\n.\\n(2.3)\\nEach event contributes 2 unknown masses, which are common to all events, and 8 unknown\\n\\xce\\xb1i four-momentum components, which differ between events. The total number of unknown\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 3 \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n'\n",
      "b'parameters is therefore 8N + 2 while the number of constraints is 6N and so the system\\nof equations is highly under-constrained.\\nIt may seem surprising at first that the above system of equations can be solved at all,\\nhowever it should be noticed that we are not concerned with measuring the four-momenta\\np(\\xce\\xb11) and p(\\xce\\xb12) for all events, but rather with measuring only the common masses m(\\xce\\xb4)\\nand m(\\xce\\xb1) using at least one event.\\nConsequently we may set out to discard events in\\nwhich the unknown masses depend on unknown four-momentum components. The problem\\ntherefore reduces to one of finding variables dependent only on the measurable quantities\\np(v1), p(v2) and ETmiss which identify events where the masses also depend only on those\\nmeasurable quantities. This general approach is effectively that taken by kinematic end-\\npoint techniques, in which the variables identifying the events, such as m(ll) or MT2, are\\nalso those which provide the mass measurment. This is also the approach which shall be\\ntaken here.\\n2.2 Transverse momentum end-points\\nOne possible starting point for this problem was outlined in Ref. [13]. In an effective two-\\nbody decay process of the type considered above the magnitude of the three-momentum\\nof the visible decay products in the rest frame of \\xce\\xb4i is given by\\n|p(vi)| = 1\\n2\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n[m2(\\xce\\xb4) \\xe2\\x88\\x92m2(\\xce\\xb1) + m2(vi)]2 \\xe2\\x88\\x92[2m(\\xce\\xb4)m(vi)]2\\nm(\\xce\\xb4)\\n\\xe2\\x89\\xa11\\n2Mi,\\n(2.4)\\nwhich defines the 2-body mass parameter Mi. It will also be useful for the discussion\\nwhich follows to define the equivalent quantity M0 for the special case where m(vi) = 0:\\nM0 \\xe2\\x89\\xa1m2(\\xce\\xb4) \\xe2\\x88\\x92m2(\\xce\\xb1)\\nm(\\xce\\xb4)\\n.\\n(2.5)\\nIf \\xce\\xb4i has a small boost in the laboratory transverse frame, then the laboratory transverse\\nmomentum of vi is of order Mi/2.\\nThis dependence of the momenta of visible decay\\nproducts on the masses of heavy particles further up the decay chain is the reason that\\nvariables such as the \\xe2\\x80\\x98effective mass\\xe2\\x80\\x99 [1] used in SUSY studies are sensitive to such masses.\\nIn principle we can improve on the use of ad hoc variables such as the effective mass\\nhowever. In the rest frame of \\xce\\xb4i the magnitude of the momentum of vi transverse to the\\nbeam direction 2, pT (vi), is bounded from above by Mi/2 because\\npT (vi) = Mi\\n2 sin \\xcf\\x88i,\\n(2.6)\\nwhere \\xcf\\x88i is the polar decay angle relative to the beam direction. Consequently if we could\\nmeasure pT (vi) we could constrain the masses.\\nUnfortunately however we are not able to measure pT (vi) directly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 instead we measure\\nthe equivalent quantity in the laboratory frame: p\\xe2\\x80\\xb2\\nT (vi). To proceed further we assume\\n2We denote quantities measured in the \\xce\\xb41\\xce\\xb42 CoM frame with primed variables and those measured in\\nthe rest frames of \\xce\\xb41 or \\xce\\xb42 with unprimed variables.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 4 \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n'\n",
      "b'that the \\xce\\xb41\\xce\\xb42 CoM frame is at rest in the laboratory transverse plane. This condition can\\nbe enforced by selecting events in which the net transverse momentum of the final state\\nexcluding the \\xce\\xb41 and \\xce\\xb42 decay products is small. In this case p\\xe2\\x80\\xb2\\nT (vi) is related to pT (vi) by\\na proper Lorentz transformation in the transverse plane through the well-known relation:\\np\\xe2\\x80\\xb22\\nT (vi) =\\n1\\n1 \\xe2\\x88\\x92\\xce\\xb22 [pT(vi) cos \\xcf\\x86i \\xc2\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2E(vi)]2 + p2\\nT (vi) sin2 \\xcf\\x86i,\\n(2.7)\\nwhere \\xce\\xb2 is the transverse boost factor (0 < \\xce\\xb2 < 1), E(vi) is the energy of vi and \\xcf\\x86i is the\\nangle in the rest frame of \\xce\\xb4i between the boost direction and pT(vi). For given vi we know\\nneither \\xce\\xb2 nor \\xcf\\x86i and hence we are not able to reconstruct pT (vi). Nevertheless we do know\\nfrom conservation of momentum that in the \\xce\\xb41\\xce\\xb42 CoM frame, and hence the laboratory\\ntransverse plane, the boost applied to v2 is equal and opposite to that applied to v1.\\nTo proceed further we shall attempt to find a quantity which can be calculated from\\nthe components of pT(v1) and pT(v2) which remains unchanged if calculated with the\\ncorresponding components of p\\xe2\\x80\\xb2\\nT(v1) and p\\xe2\\x80\\xb2\\nT(v2). If we could find such a quantity then we\\ncould use it to relate momenta measured in the \\xce\\xb41\\xce\\xb42 CoM frame to those measured in the\\n\\xce\\xb41 and \\xce\\xb42 rest frames and hence constrain Mi.\\n2.3 Cotransverse mass and contransverse mass\\nConsider first a system containing two particles v1 and v2 with masses m(v1) and m(v2)\\nmeasured in some frame F(0) to have four-momenta p(v1) and p(v2). If both these particles\\nare now measured in a different frame F(1) it is well known that the mass obtained from\\np(v1) + p(v2) remains unchanged, i.e. the quantity\\nm2(v1, v2) = [E(v1) + E(v2)]2 \\xe2\\x88\\x92[p(v1) + p(v2)]2\\n= m2(v1) + m2(v2) + 2[E(v1)E(v2) \\xe2\\x88\\x92p(v1) \\xc2\\xb7 p(v2)]\\n(2.8)\\nis invariant. Another way to interpret this is that when particles v1 and v2 are subjected\\nto co-linear boosts of equal magnitude m2(v1, v2) is invariant.\\nNow let us examine what happens when we start from one frame F(0), but boost\\nparticles v1 and v2 to different frames F(1) and F(2) respectively. These new frames are\\ndistinguished by the fact that their boosts are of equal magnitude but opposite direction in\\nframe F(0). In other words particles v1 and v2 are subjected to contra-linear boosts of equal\\nmagnitude. Clearly m2(v1, v2) is no longer an invariant \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this can be seen for instance by\\nconsidering p(v1) = \\xe2\\x88\\x92p(v2) in which case E(v1) + E(v2) increases with increasing \\xce\\xb2 while\\np(v1) + p(v2) remains zero.\\nConsider now a new quantity MC equivalent to the invariant mass obtained from\\np(v1) + P(p(v2)) where P is the standard parity transformation operator:\\nM2\\nC(v1, v2) \\xe2\\x89\\xa1[E(v1) + E(v2)]2 \\xe2\\x88\\x92[p(v1) \\xe2\\x88\\x92p(v2)]2\\n= m2(v1) + m2(v2) + 2[E(v1)E(v2) + p(v1) \\xc2\\xb7 p(v2)].\\n(2.9)\\nThis quantity is invariant under the contra-linear boosts considered above.

For instance in the case considered above F(0) could\\nbe identified with the \\xce\\xb41\\xce\\xb42 CoM frame and F(1) and F(2) identified with the rest frames of\\n\\xce\\xb41 and \\xce\\xb42, in which |p(v1)| = M1/2 and |p(v2)| = M2/2.\\nFrom a practical perspective the quantity MC(v1, v2) defined by Eqn. 2.9 is relevant\\nonly to cases where the \\xce\\xb41\\xce\\xb42 CoM frame is at rest in the laboratory frame, for instance in\\ncollisions at a lepton collider such as LEP or the ILC. At a hadron collider the scenario\\nis more complicated.\\nAs discussed above, co-linear boosts in the laboratory transverse\\nplane can be limited by selecting events in which the net transverse momentum of the\\nfinal state excluding the \\xce\\xb41 and \\xce\\xb42 decay products is small.\\nThere remains however a\\npotentially large co-linear boost in the beam (\\xcb\\x86z) direction caused by the differing proton\\nmomentum fractions of the colliding partons in the event initial state. MC(v1, v2) is not\\ninvariant under co-linear boosts of v1 and v2 because P does not commute with proper\\nLorentz transformations. Consequently we must focus purely on quantities constructed\\nfrom momentum components measured in the laboratory plane transverse to the beam\\ndirection.\\nIf v1 and v2 were subjected to co-linear rather than contra-linear equal magnitude\\nboosts in the laboratory transverse plane then a suitable invariant quantity to consider\\nwould be the transverse mass mT (v1, v2) [14], hereafter refered to as the cotransverse mass.\\nmT (v1, v2) is defined by:\\nm2\\nT (v1, v2) = [ET (v1) + ET (v2)]2 \\xe2\\x88\\x92[pT(v1) + pT(v2)]2\\n= m2(v1) + m2(v2) + 2[ET (v1)ET (v2) \\xe2\\x88\\x92pT(v1) \\xc2\\xb7 pT(v2)],\\n(2.11)\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 6 \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n'\n",

Extension to measurement of individual particle masses\\nSo far we have shown that we can obtain an end-point in the distribution of a quantity\\ncalculated from visible decay product transverse momenta which depends on an analytical\\ncombination of masses. In principle it is possible to use the position of this end-point to\\nmeasure the individual masses m(\\xce\\xb4) and m(\\xce\\xb1). The key to this is recognising that Mi\\ndepends upon both the unknown masses m(\\xce\\xb4) and m(\\xce\\xb1) and the visible masses m(vi). If\\none requires that m(v1) = m(v2) = m(v) then it can be shown from Eqns. 2.4 and 2.14\\nthat for given m(v) the bound on MCT is given by:\\nMmax\\nCT\\n=\\n1\\nm(\\xce\\xb4)m2(v) + M0.\\n(4.1)\\nConsequently if events could be found in which m(v1) and m(v2) were non-zero and\\nequal, for instance by accurately combining products from several decays in a multi-step\\nchain, then the position of Mmax\\nCT\\nwould depend linearly on m2(v) with a gradient of\\n1/m(\\xce\\xb4) and intercepting the ordinate at M0. The gradient of a linear fit to this bound\\ntherefore measures m(\\xce\\xb4) independently of m(\\xce\\xb1), while the intercept then allows m(\\xce\\xb1) to\\nbe constrained. As an aside it is interesting to note that in this case MCT is also bounded\\nfrom below by:\\nMmin\\nCT\\n= 2\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nm2(v).\\n(4.2)\\nand for exclusive decay chains m2(v) is bounded from above by a separate analytical com-\\nbination of masses identical to that used by the end-point method discussed in Section 1.\\nThe above technique should work in principle however it is likely to be very difficult\\nto implement in practice. The first difficulty is connected with unambiguously associating\\ndecay products with SUSY decay chains. One possible approach would involve focusing\\non specific exclusive decay chains, using the values of invariant masses of combinations of\\ndecay products to associate decay products to chains [4]. Unfortunately however the low\\nacceptance of such exclusive selections is likely to prevent successful application of this\\ntechnique before significant quantities of data have been acquired.\\nA second approach involves inclusive selection of SUSY events with multiple visible\\ndecay products, and use of a kinematic algorithm to approximately associate decay products\\nto chains. Fig. 3(left) shows the result of an attempt at applying this approach to SPS1a\\nevents with ISR turned off. Here decay products have been associated to chains by requiring\\nthat max[m2(v1), m2(v2)] is minimised. Events have been selected by requiring four jets\\nand no leptons, and the mass-squared equality requirement mentioned above has been\\nimposed by requiring that the asymmetry in m2(v1) and m2(v2) is less than 10%. An\\nadditional cut requiring the rapidity difference between v1 and v2 to be greater than 1.0\\nhas also been applied to reduce combinatorics.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 12 \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n'\n",

The lower bound on MCT given by\\nEqn. 4.2 is prominent (bottom line). Fig. 3(right), obtained with SPS1a events with ISR\\nturned on, illustrates the further difficulty of using this approach however. The inclusion of\\nISR jets in v1 and/or v2 can artificially lower m2(v) and hence generate false configurations\\nwhich strongly violate the upper bounds on MCT . A related effect was noted previously\\nin connection with the stransverse mass technique in Ref. [8]. Clearly much more work is\\nneeded before this technique can be used practically to measure accurately independent\\nparticle masses.\\n5. Conclusions and directions for future work\\nThis paper has shown that by constructing a kinematic quantity invariant under contra-\\nlinear equal magnitude boosts in the laboratory transverse plane a simple analytical com-\\nbination of the masses of pair-produced particles and their invisible decay products can\\nbe constrained at hadron colliders such as the LHC. It was shown that in principle these\\ntechniques may be used to measure the masses of such particles independently, although\\nin practice this seems to be very difficult.\\nThe study described in this paper suggests several directions for future work.

In the type II seesaw mechanism, in addition to the type I seesaw contribution, an additional direct mass term for the light neutrinos is present. We\\nconsider type II seesaw scenarios where this additional contribution arises from\\nthe vacuum expectation value of a Higgs triplet, and furthermore an effective\\nmodel-independent approach. We investigate bounds on the flavour-specific decay asymmetries, on the mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino and on the\\nreheat temperature of the early universe, and compare them to the corresponding\\nbounds in the type I seesaw framework. We show that while flavour-dependent\\nthermal type II leptogenesis becomes more efficient for larger mass scale of the\\nlight neutrinos, and the bounds become relaxed, the type I seesaw scenario for\\nleptogenesis becomes more constrained. We also argue that in general, flavourdependent effects cannot be ignored when dealing with leptogenesis in type II\\nseesaw models.\\n\\na\\n\\nE-mail: antusch@delta.ft.uam.es\\n\\n\\x0c1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nLeptogenesis [1] is one of the most attractive and minimal mechanisms for explaining\\nthe observed baryon asymmetry of the universe nB /n\\xce\\xb3 \\xe2\\x89\\x88 (6.0965 \\xc2\\xb1 0.2055) \\xc3\\x97 10\\xe2\\x88\\x9210 [2].\\nA lepton asymmetry is dynamically generated and then converted into a baryon asymmetry due to (B + L)-violating sphaleron interactions [3] which exist in the Standard\\nModel (SM) and its minimal supersymmetric extension, the MSSM. Leptogenesis can be\\nimplemented within the type I seesaw scenario [4], consisting of the SM (MSSM) plus\\nthree right-handed Majorana neutrinos (and their superpartners) with a hierarchical\\nspectrum. In thermal leptogenesis [5], the lightest of the right-handed neutrinos is produced by thermal scattering after inflation, and subsequently decays out-of-equilibrium\\nin a lepton number and CP-violating way, thus satisfying Sakharov\\xe2\\x80\\x99s constraints [6].\\nIn models with a left-right symmetric particle content like minimal left-right symmetric models, Pati-Salam models or Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) based on SO(10),\\nthe type I seesaw mechanism is typically generalised to a type II seesaw [7], where\\nan additional direct mass term mII\\nLL for the light neutrinos is present. From a model\\nindependent perspective, the type II mass term can be considered as an additional contribution to the lowest dimensional effective neutrino mass operator. In most explicit\\nmodels, the type II contribution stems from seesaw suppressed induced vevs of SU(2)L triplet Higgs fields. One motivation for considering the type II seesaw is that it allows\\nto construct unified flavour models for partially degenerate neutrinos in an elegant way,\\ne.g. via a type II upgrade [8], which is otherwise difficult to achieve in type I models.\\nFor leptogenesis in type II seesaw scenarios with SU(2)L -triplet Higgs fields, there\\nare in general two possibilities to generate the baryon asymmetry: via decays of the\\nlightest right-handed neutrinos or via decays of the SU(2)L -triplets [9, 10, 11, 12]. In the\\nfirst case, there are additional one-loop diagrams where virtual triplets are running in\\nthe loop [9, 13, 14, 15, 16]. In the following, we focus on this possibility, and assume\\nhierarchical right-handed neutrino masses (and that the triplets are heavier than \\xce\\xbdR1 ).\\nIn this limit, to a good approximation the decay asymmetry depends mainly on the\\nlow energy neutrino mass matrix m\\xce\\xbdLL = mILL + mII\\nLL and on the Yukawa couplings\\nto the lightest right-handed neutrino and its mass [16]. It has been shown that type\\nII leptogenesis imposes constraints on the seesaw parameters, which, in the flavourindependent approximation, differ substantially from the constraints in the type I case.\\nFor instance, the bound on the decay asymmetry increases with increasing neutrino mass\\nscale [16], in contrast to the type I case where it decreases. As a consequence, the lower\\nbound on the mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino from leptogenesis decreases for\\nincreasing neutrino mass scale [16]. One interesting application of type II leptogenesis\\nis the possibility to improve consistency of classes of unified flavour models with respect\\nto thermal leptogenesis [17]. Finally, since the type II contribution typically does not\\neffect washout, there is no bound on the absolute neutrino mass scale from type II\\nleptogenesis, as has been pointed out in [15]. For further applications and realisations\\nof type II leptogenesis in specific models of fermion masses and mixings, see e.g. [18].\\nIn recent years, the impact of flavour in thermal leptogenesis has merited increasing\\nattention [19] - [38]. In fact, the one-flavour approximation is only rigorously correct\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cwhen the interactions mediated by the charged lepton Yukawa couplings are out of\\nequilibrium. Below a given temperature (e.g. O(1012 GeV) in the SM and (1 + tan2 \\xce\\xb2) \\xc3\\x97\\nO(1012 GeV) in the MSSM), the tau Yukawa coupling comes into equilibrium (later\\nfollowed by the couplings of the muon and electron). Flavour effects are then physical\\nand become manifest, not only at the level of the generated CP asymmetries, but also\\nregarding the washout processes that destroy the asymmetries created for each flavour.\\nIn the full computation, the asymmetries in each distinguishable flavour are differently\\nwashed out, and appear with distinct weights in the final baryon asymmetry.\\nFlavour-dependent leptogenesis in the type I seesaw scenario has recently been addressed in detail by several authors. In particular, flavour-dependent effects in leptogenesis have been studied, and shown to be relevant, in the two right-handed neutrino\\nmodels [24] as well as in classes of neutrino mass models with three right-handed neutrinos [26]. The quantum oscillations/correlations of the asymmetries in lepton flavour\\nspace have been included in [22, 32, 33, 35] and the treatment has been generalised to\\nthe MSSM [26, 29]. Effects of reheating, and constraints on the seesaw parameters from\\nupper bounds on the reheat temperature, have been investigated in [29]. Leptogenesis\\nbounds on the reheat temperature [29] and on the mass of the lightest right-handed\\nneutrino [29, 36] have also been considered including flavour-dependent effects. Strong\\nconnections between the low-energy CP phases of the UMNS matrix and CP violation for\\nflavour-dependent leptogenesis have been shown to emerge in certain classes of neutrino\\nmass models [26] or under the hypothesis of no CP violation sources associated with the\\nright-handed neutrino sector (real R) [25,27,28,31]. Possible effects regarding the decays\\nof the heavier right-handed neutrinos for leptogenesis have been discussed in this context in [21, 34], and flavour-dependent effects for resonant leptogenesis were addressed\\nin [38]. Regarding the masses of the light neutrinos, assuming hierarchical right-handed\\nneutrinos and considering experimentally allowed light neutrino masses (below about 0.4\\neV), there is no longer a bound on the neutrino mass scale from thermal leptogenesis if\\nflavour-dependent effects are included [24].\\nIn view of the importance of flavour-dependent effects on leptogenesis in the type I\\nseesaw case, it is pertinent to investigate their effects on type II leptogenesis. In this\\npaper, we therefore reanalyse leptogenesis via the out-of-equilibrium decay of the lightest\\nright-handed neutrino in type II seesaw scenarios, taking into account flavour-dependent\\neffects. We investigate bounds on the decay asymmetries, on the mass of the lightest\\nright-handed neutrino and on the reheat temperature of the early universe, and discuss\\nhow increasing the neutrino mass scale affects thermal leptogenesis in the type I and\\ntype II seesaw frameworks.\\n\\n2\\n\\nType I and type II seesaw mechanisms\\n\\nMotivated by left-right symmetric unified theories, we consider two generic possibilities\\nfor explaining the smallness of neutrino masses: via heavy SM (MSSM) singlet fermions\\n(i.e. right-handed neutrinos) [4] and via heavy SU(2)L -triplet Higgs fields [7].

The effects are manifest not only in the flavour-dependent CP\\nasymmetries, but also in the flavour-dependence of scattering processes in the thermal\\nbath, which can destroy a previously produced asymmetry.\\nThe relevance of the flavour-dependent effects depends on the temperatures at which\\nthermal leptogenesis takes place, and thus on which interactions mediated by the charged\\nlepton Yukawa couplings are in thermal equilibrium. For example, in the MSSM, for\\ntemperatures between circa (1+tan2 \\xce\\xb2)\\xc3\\x97105 GeV and (1+tan2 \\xce\\xb2)\\xc3\\x97109 GeV, the \\xc2\\xb5 and \\xcf\\x84\\nYukawa couplings are in thermal equilibrium and all flavours in the Boltzmann equations\\nare to be treated separately. For tan \\xce\\xb2 = 30, this applies for temperatures below about\\n1012 GeV and above 108 GeV, a temperature range which is of most interest for thermal\\nleptogenesis in the MSSM. In the SM, in the temperature range between circa 109 GeV\\nand 1012 GeV, only the \\xcf\\x84 Yukawa coupling is in equilibrium and is treated separately in\\nthe Boltzmann equations, whereas \\xc2\\xb5 and e flavours are indistinguishable. A discussion\\nof the temperature regimes in the SM and MSSM, where flavour is important, can be\\nfound, e.g., in [26].\\nWe now briefly review the estimation of the produced baryon asymmetry in flavourdependent leptogenesis.2 For definiteness, we focus on the temperature range where\\nall flavours are to be treated separately. In the following discussion of thermal type II\\nleptogenesis, we will assume that the mass M\\xe2\\x88\\x86L of the triplet(s) is much larger than\\nMR1 . In this limit, the flavour-dependent efficiencies calculated in the type I seesaw\\nscenario can also be used in the type II framework. The out-of-equilibrium decays of the\\nheavy right-handed (s)neutrinos \\xce\\xbdR1 and \\xce\\xbdeR1 give rise to flavour-dependent asymmetries\\nin the (s)lepton sector, which are then partly transformed via sphaleron conversion into\\n2\\n\\nFor a discussion of approximations which typically enter these estimates, and which also apply to\\nour discussion, see e.g. section 3.1.3 in [29].\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0ca baryon asymmetry YB .3 The final baryon asymmetry can be calculated as\\n12 X SM\\nY\\n,\\n37 f \\xe2\\x88\\x86f\\n10 X MSSM\\n=\\nY\\xcc\\x82\\n,\\n31 f \\xe2\\x88\\x86f\\n\\nYBSM =\\nYBMSSM\\n\\n(5)\\n(6)\\n\\nwhere Y\\xcc\\x82\\xe2\\x88\\x86f \\xe2\\x89\\xa1 YB /3 \\xe2\\x88\\x92 YLf are the total (particle and sparticle) B/3 \\xe2\\x88\\x92 Lf asymmetries,\\nwith YLf the lepton number densities in the flavour f = e, \\xc2\\xb5, \\xcf\\x84 .

The small off-diagonal entries of A\\nhave been neglected, which is a good approximation in most cases. In general, however, they have to\\nbe included. More relevant than the differences in the flavour-dependent efficiency factors for different\\nK/|Af f Kf | is that the total baryon asymmetry is the sum of each individual lepton asymmetries, which\\nis weighted by the corresponding efficiency factors.\\n\\ncalculated in the type I seesaw scenario can also be used in the type II framework. In\\nthe definition of the efficiency factor, the equilibrium number densities serve as a normalization: A thermal population \\xce\\xbdR1 (and \\xce\\xbdeR1 ) decaying completely out of equilibrium\\n(without washout effects) would lead to \\xce\\xb7f = 1.\\nThe efficiency factors can be computed by means of the flavour-dependent Boltzmann\\nequations, which can be found for the SM in [19,22,23,24] and for the MSSM in [26,29].\\nIn general, the flavour-dependent efficiencies depend strongly on the washout parameters\\nm\\ne 1,f for each flavour, and on the total washout parameter m\\ne 1 , which are defined as\\nm\\ne 1,f =\\n\\nvu2 |(Y\\xce\\xbd )f 1 |2\\n,\\nMR1\\n\\nm\\ne1 =\\n\\nX\\nf\\n\\nm\\ne 1,f .\\n\\nAlternatively, one may use the quantities Kf , K, which are related to m\\ne 1,f , m\\ne 1 by\\nKf =\\n\\nm\\ne 1,f\\n,\\nm\\xe2\\x88\\x97\\n\\nK =\\n\\nX\\n\\nKf ,\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n(11)\\n\\nf\\n\\nwith m\\xe2\\x88\\x97SM \\xe2\\x89\\x88 1.08 \\xc3\\x97 10\\xe2\\x88\\x923 eV and m\\xe2\\x88\\x97MSSM \\xe2\\x89\\x88 sin2 (\\xce\\xb2) \\xc3\\x97 1.58 \\xc3\\x97 10\\xe2\\x88\\x923 eV.

Therefore, upon summing over the lepton asymmetries,\\nthe total baryon\\nP number is generically not proportional to the sum over the CP asymmetries, \\xce\\xb51 = f \\xce\\xb51,f , as in the flavour-independent approximation where the lepton flavour\\nis neglected in the Boltzmann equations. In other words, in\\nthe flavour-independent\\nap\\x10P\\n\\x11\\nP\\nind\\nproximation the total baryon asymmetry is a function of\\n( g Kg ). In\\nf \\xce\\xb51,f \\xc3\\x97 \\xce\\xb7\\nthe\\nP correct flavour treatment the baryon asymmetry is (approximately) a function of\\nf \\xce\\xb51,f \\xce\\xb7 (Af f Kf , K). From this, it is already clear that flavour-dependent effects can\\nhave important consequences also in type II leptogenesis.\\nThe most important quantities for computing the produced baryon asymmetry are\\nthus the decay asymmetries \\xce\\xb51,f and the efficiency factors \\xce\\xb7f (which depend mainly on\\nm\\ne 1,f and m\\ne 1 (or Kf and K)). While the efficiency factors can be computed similarly\\nto the type I seesaw case, important differences between leptogenesis in type I and type\\nII seesaw scenarios arise concerning the decay asymmetries as well as concerning the\\nconnection between leptogenesis and seesaw parameters.\\n\\n4\\n\\nDecay asymmetries\\n\\n4.1\\n\\nRight-handed neutrinos plus triplets\\n\\nRegarding the decay asymmetry in the type II seesaw mechanism, where the direct\\nmass term for the neutrinos stems from the induced vev of a Higgs triplet, there are\\nnew contributions from 1-loop diagrams where virtual SU(2)L -triplet scalar fields (or\\ntheir superpartners) are exchanged in the loop.

For definiteness,\\nthe MSSM with tan \\xce\\xb2 = 30 has been considered as an example.\\n\\nthe flavour-independent\\napproximation, Eq. (28) leads to a dramatically more restrictive\\nP\\nbound on \\xce\\xb51 = f \\xce\\xb51,f [44] for quasi-degenerate light neutrino masses, and finally even\\nto a bound on the neutrino mass scale [43]. This can be understood from the fact that\\nfor m\\ne 1 \\xe2\\x89\\xab m\\xe2\\x88\\x97 in the flavour-independent approximation, washout effects strongly reduce\\nthe efficiency of thermal leptogenesis. Similarly, in the flavour-dependent treatment,\\nm\\ne 1,f \\xe2\\x89\\xab m\\xe2\\x88\\x97 would lead to a strongly reduced efficiency for this specific flavour. This\\nstrong washout for quasi-degenerate light neutrinos can be avoided in flavour-dependent\\ntype I leptogenesis, and m\\ne 1,f \\xe2\\x89\\x88 m\\xe2\\x88\\x97 can realise a nearly optimal scenario regarding\\nwashout (c.f. figure 3). However, we see from equation (27) that the decay asymmetries\\nin this case are reduced by a factor of (m\\xe2\\x88\\x97 /m\\xce\\xbdmin )1/2 when compared to the optimal value,\\nleading to a reduced baryon asymmetry. On the other hand, realizing nearly optimal\\n\\xce\\xb51,f requires m\\ne 1,f \\xe2\\x89\\x88 m\\ne 1 \\xe2\\x89\\xa5 m\\xce\\xbdmin , leading to large washout effects for quasi-degenerate\\nlight neutrinos and even to a more strongly suppressed generation of baryon asymmetry\\n(c.f. figure 3). As a consequence, increasing the neutrino mass scale increases the lower\\nbound on MR1 (also in the presence of flavour-dependent effects), in contrast to the type\\nII seesaw case.\\nComparing the type II and type I seesaw cases, in the latter the baryon asymmetry\\nis suppressed for quasi-degenerate light neutrino masses either by a factor (m\\xe2\\x88\\x97 /m\\xce\\xbdmin )1/2\\nin the decay asymmetries or by a non-optimal washout parameter much larger than m\\xe2\\x88\\x97\\n(or Kf \\xe2\\x89\\xab 1, c.f. figure 3). The bounds on the decay asymmetries in type I and type\\nII leptogenesis are compared in figure 6, where m\\ne 1,f has been fixed to m\\xe2\\x88\\x97 , close to its\\noptimal value. From figure 6 we see that in the type I case the maximal baryon asymmetry is obtained for hierarchical neutrino masses, whereas in the type II case, increasing\\nthe neutrino mass scale increases the produced baryon asymmetry and therefore allows\\nto relax the bound on MR1 , as shown in figure 7. In addition, for the same reason,\\nincreasing the neutrino mass scale also relaxes the lower bound on the reheat temperature TRH from the requirement of successful type II leptogenesis.

We have taken into account flavour-dependent\\neffects, which are relevant if thermal leptogenesis takes place at temperatures below\\ncirca 1012 GeV in the SM and below circa (1 + tan2 \\xce\\xb2) \\xc3\\x97 1012 GeV in the MSSM. As\\nin type I leptogenesis, in the flavour-dependent regime the decays of the right-handed\\n(s)neutrinos generate asymmetries in in each distinguishable flavour (proportional to the\\nflavour-specific decay asymmetries \\xce\\xb51,f ), which are differently washed out by scattering\\nprocesses in the thermal bath, and thus appear with distinct weights (efficiency factors\\n\\xce\\xb7f ) in the final baryon asymmetry.\\nThe most important quantities for computing the produced baryon asymmetry are\\n14\\n\\n\\x0cthe decay asymmetries \\xce\\xb51,f and the efficiency\\nfactors \\xce\\xb7f (which mainly depend on\\nP\\nwashout parameters m\\ne 1,f and m\\ne1 =\\ne 1,f ). With respect to the flavour-specific\\nf m\\nefficiency factors \\xce\\xb7f , in the limit that the mass M\\xe2\\x88\\x86L of the triplet is much larger than\\nMR1 (and MR1 \\xe2\\x89\\xaa MR2 , MR3 ), they can be estimated from the same Boltzmann equations as in the type I seesaw framework. Regarding the decay asymmetries \\xce\\xb51,f , in the\\ntype II seesaw case there are additional contributions where virtual Higgs triplets (and\\ntheir superpartners) run in the 1-loop diagrams. Here, we have generalised the results\\nof [16] to the flavour-dependent case. The most important effects of flavour in leptogenesis are a consequence of the fact that\\x10in the flavour-independent\\napproximation the\\n\\x11\\nP\\nP\\nind\\ntotal baryon asymmetry is a function of\\n( gm\\ne 1,g ), whereas in the corf \\xce\\xb51,f \\xc3\\x97 \\xce\\xb7\\nrect\\nPflavour-dependent treatment the baryon asymmetry is (approximately) a function\\nof f \\xce\\xb51,f \\xce\\xb7 (Af f m\\ne 1,f , m\\ne 1 ).\\n\\nWe have then investigated the bounds on the flavour-specific decay asymmetries \\xce\\xb51,f .\\nIn the type I seesaw case, it is known that the bound on the flavour-specific\\nasymmetries\\nP\\n\\xce\\xb5I1,f is substantially relaxed [24] compared to the bound on \\xce\\xb5I1 = f \\xce\\xb5I1,f [44] in the case\\nof a quasi-degenerate spectrum of light neutrinos. For experimentally allowed light\\nneutrino masses below about 0.4 eV, there is no longer a bound on the neutrino mass\\nscale from the requirement of successful thermal leptogenesis. In the type II seesaw case,\\nwe have derived the bound on the flavour-specific decay asymmetries \\xce\\xb51,f = \\xce\\xb5I1,fP+ \\xce\\xb5II\\n1,f ,\\nwhich turns out to be identical to the bound on the total decay asymmetry \\xce\\xb51 = f \\xce\\xb51,f .\\nWe have compared the bound on the flavour-specific decay asymmetries in type I and\\ntype II scenarios, and found that while the type II bound increases with the neutrino\\nmass scale, the type I bound decreases (for experimentally allowed light neutrino masses\\nbelow about 0.4 eV). The relaxed bound on \\xce\\xb51,f (figure 6) leads to a lower bound on the\\nmass of the lightest right-handed neutrino MR1 in the type II seesaw scenario (figure\\n7), which decreases when the neutrino mass scale increases. Furthermore, it leads to\\na relaxed lower bound on the reheat temperature TRH of the early universe (figure 8),\\nwhich helps to improve consistency of thermal leptogenesis with upper bounds on TRH\\nin some supergravity models. This is in contrast to the type I seesaw scenario, where\\nthe lower bound on TRH from thermal leptogenesis increases with increasing neutrino\\nmass scale. Constraints on TRH can therefore imply constraints on the mass scale of the\\nlight neutrinos also in flavour-dependent type I leptogenesis, although a general bound\\nis absent.\\nWe have furthermore argued that these relaxed bounds on \\xce\\xb51,f MR1 and TRH in the\\ntype II case can be nearly saturated in an elegant way in classes of so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctypeII-upgraded\\xe2\\x80\\x9d seesaw models [8], where the type II contribution to the neutrino mass\\nmatrix is proportional to the unit matrix (enforced e.g. by an SO(3) flavour symmetry\\nor by one of its non-Abelian subgroups). One interesting application of these type II\\nseesaw scenarios is that the consistency of thermal leptogenesis with unified theories\\nof flavour is improved compared to the type I seesaw case. This effect, investigated in\\nthe flavour-independent approximation in [17], is also present analogously in the flavourdependent treatment of leptogenesis. The reason is that if the type II contribution (\\xe2\\x88\\x9d 1)\\ndominates, the decay asymmetries \\xce\\xb51,f become approximately equal and the estimate for\\nthe produced baryon asymmetry is similar to the flavour-independent case. Nevertheless,\\n15\\n\\n\\x0can accurate analysis of leptogenesis in this scenario requires careful inclusion of the\\nflavour-dependent effects. In many applications and realisations of type II leptogenesis\\nin specific models of fermion masses and mixings (see e.g. [18]), flavour-dependent effects\\nmay substantially change the results and they therefore have to be taken into account.\\nIn summary, type II leptogenesis provides a well-motivated generalisation of the\\nconventional scenario of leptogenesis in the type I seesaw framework. We have argued\\nthat flavour-dependent effects have to be included in type II leptogenesis, and can change\\npredictions of existing models as well as open up new possibilities for for successful\\nmodels of leptogenesis. Comparing bounds on \\xce\\xb51,f MR1 and TRH in flavour-dependent\\nthermal type I and type II leptogenesis scenarios, we have shown that while type II\\nleptogenesis becomes more efficient for larger mass scale of the light neutrinos, and the\\nbounds become relaxed, leptogenesis within the type I seesaw framework becomes more\\nconstrained.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\nI would like to thank Steve F.

The study of the planar dilatation operator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s integrability is very important because it not only enable us\\nto test the Maldacena\\xe2\\x80\\x99s correspondence as it is an generator of nontrivial integrable models. Exactly solvable models\\nare of interest in both physics and mathematics since the pioneering work of Hans Bethe [5]. The Bethe ansatz\\nand its generalisations emerged over the years as a quite efficient and powerful tool for the exact solution of the\\neigenspectrum of a great variety of one dimensional quantum chains and two-dimensional transfer matrices (see, e.g.,\\n\\xe2\\x88\\x97lazo@smail.ufsm.br\\narXiv:0802.3802v1  [hep-th]  26 Feb 2008\\n2\\n[6, 7, 8, 9] for reviews). According to this ansatz the amplitudes of the eigenfunction are expressed by a nonlinear\\ncombination of properly defined plane waves. On the other hand, in the last two decades several different ansatz\\nwere introduced in the literature under the general name of matrix product ansatz (MPA). The first formulation\\nwas done for the description of the ground-state eigenfunction of some special non-integrable quantum chains, the so\\ncalled valence-bond solid models [10, 11, 12, 13]. The MPA becomes also a successful tool for the exact calculation\\nof the stationary probability distribution of some stochastic one dimensional systems [14, 15, 16]. An extension of\\nthis last MPA, called dynamical MPA was introduced in [17, 18] and extended in [19]. This last ansatz gives the\\ntime-dependent probability distribution for some exact integrable systems. The MPA we are going to use in this\\npaper, in order to solve the U(1)N quantum spin chain, was introduced in [20, 21, 22, 23]. This ansatz was applied\\nwith success in the evaluation of the spectra of several integrable quantum Hamiltonians [20, 21, 22], transfer matrices\\n[24, 25, 26] and the time-evolution operator of stochastic systems [23]. According to this ansatz, the amplitudes of the\\neigenfunctions are given in terms of a product of matrices where the matrices obey appropriated algebraic relations.\\nIn the case of the Bethe ansatz the spectral parameters and the amplitudes of the plane waves are fixed, apart from a\\nnormalisation constant, by the eigenvalue equation of the Hamiltonian or transfer matrix. On the other hand, in the\\nMPA the eigenvalue equation fixes the commutation relations of the matrices defining the ansatz. In such case the\\nspectrum of the Hamiltonian or transfer matrix, and the corresponding eigenfunctions, can be computed in a purely\\nalgebraic way.\\nIn the present paper we study the most general quantum spin chain with U(1)N symmetry with nearest neighbour\\ninteraction thought a MPA in the generalised Lunin-Maldacena backgrounds (in this case we are only interested in\\nzero momentum eigenstates, the more general case, including all momentum states, will be presented in [27]). This\\nmodel contains as a special case the integrable so(6) spin chain related to the one loop planar dilatation operator of\\nthe N = 4 Super Yang-Mills [1]. We analyse the Yang-Baxter equation in the N = 3 sector and the consistence of\\nthe algebraic relations among the matrices defining the ansatz and find that the solutions are separated in two class.\\nIn the first (class A) we obtain the models presented in [28, 29, 30, 31], in the context of one loop dilatation operator,\\nas well as in condensed matter physics and stochastic models [19, 21, 23, 32, 33, 34]. In the second class (class B) we\\nobtain the model presented in [19] for the stochastic problem of fully asymmetric diffusion of two kinds of particles.\\nIn this last sector we also find a new type of integrable model unknown up to now. Our solution generalises the\\nprevious results obtained in (14) through the coordinate Bethe ansatz for U(1)N quantum spin chains. The analyses\\n3\\nof the model for the full sector with U(1)N symmetry will be presented elsewhere [27].\\nTHE U(1)N SPIN CHAIN IN THE GENERALISED LUNIN-MALDACENA BACKGROUNDS\\nThe AdS/CFT conjecture relates operators, states, correlation functions and dynamics between the N = 4 Super\\nYang-Mills with IIB string theory in AdS5 \\xc3\\x97 S5 spaces. One of the most important results of this conjecture predicts\\nthat the spectrum of scaling dimension D of gauge invariant operators, in the conformal field theory, should coincide\\nwith the spectrum of energies E of string states. Furthermore, this correspondence relates the weak coupling constant\\nregime, in the gauge theory, with the strong coupling constant ones, in the string theory. Currently it is only possible\\nto test the Maldacena\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conjecture for a limited class of operators, and only in the case of large \\xce\\xbb values of the \\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nHooft coupling constant. Operators where this conjecture can be tested are called BMN (Berenstein, Maldacena e\\nNastase) operators [35]. These operators are local primary operators in S5 with large J charge, in the planar limit\\n(large \\xce\\xbb). These operator are given by the trace of a product of a large number the six scalar fields of the theory. The\\nmost general operator O in this class is given by\\nO(\\xce\\xa8, N) = \\xce\\xa8\\xce\\xb11...\\xce\\xb1L\\nN\\nTr(\\xce\\xa6\\xce\\xb11 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xce\\xa6\\xce\\xb1L),\\n(1)\\nwhere \\xce\\xb1j = 1, ..., N, with N = 6 and j = 1, ...L, and L >> 1 is the number of fields. Instead of restrict our study\\nto the case N = 6, we will consider in this work N general. The planar dilatation operator D, that is one of the\\ngenerators of the conformal algebra and it give us the scaling dimensions of local operators, and consequently give us\\nthe energies of the string\\xe2\\x80\\x99s states, is given by:\\nD(g) = L + g2H + O\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd1\\nN\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n,\\n(2)\\nwhere g = g2\\nY MN\\n8\\xcf\\x802 , and the operator L counts the number of scalar fields on the operators O (1). The operator H is\\nthe one loop planar dilatation operator. This operator H was identified [1] with an exactly integrable uni dimensional\\nSO(6) quantum spin chain Hamiltonian. By this expansion in loops (2) it can perturbativelly compare the string\\ntheory in the BMN limit to the field theory. On the other hand, this equivalence between the dilatation operator with\\nintegrable spin chain makes possible to use the powerful Bethe ansatz to diagonalise the one-loop dilatation operator\\n[1]. By diagonalising this operator through the Bethe ansatz, it is obtained the scaling dimensions of any state of\\nlocal operators in the conformal field theory in a purely algebraic way. The integrability also guarantees that these\\nscaling dimensions can be exactly obtained for all gauge group, and in particular, for the U(N) group [36]. On the\\n4\\nside of string theory, the integrable structures was discovered by the observation that Green Schwartz superstrings in\\nAdS5 \\xc3\\x97 S5 has an infinite set of conserved non-local charges [37]. These results have made possible the comparison\\nbetween gauge theories and string theories in the plane wave limit [38], furthermore, the integrability enable us to\\nmake very precise tests for the correspondence AdS/CFT.\\nThe most general one-loop dilatation operator is related with an integrable spin model with long-range couplings\\n[39]. In the particular case of only two types of scalar fields on the BMN operators (2) (case N = 2), this integrable\\nHamiltonian reduces to the famous XXX model [1]. On the other hand, the case of N = 3 was studied by Frolov e\\nTseytlin [40] and it corresponds to a spin-1 spin chain. The most general spin-1 model in condensed matter physics\\n[21] was obtained by us in a recent work, but it is not studied with the objective of classifying all possible solutions.\\nIn the context of the one-loop dilatation operator the solution, on class A presented here, was obtained in [28].\\nWe consider here the most general N-state spin chain with nearest neighbour interaction, periodic boundary con-\\ndition, zero momentum eigenstates [46], and U(1)N symmetry. The N possible states configurations of a given site is\\nrelated to the N different types of scalar fields in (1). The U(1)N symmetry imply that the Hamiltonian describing\\nthe time evolution of this spin chain conserves the number of states of each type. By denoting the basis of states at\\na given site as |\\xce\\xb1\\xe2\\x9f\\xa9(\\xce\\xb1 = 1, ..., N), the Hamiltonian in a periodic lattice with L sites takes the form\\nH =\\nL\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nj=1\\n\\xef\\xa3\\xab\\n\\xef\\xa3\\xad\\nN\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\xce\\xb1\\xcc\\xb8=\\xce\\xb2=1\\n\\xce\\x93\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2\\n\\xce\\xb2 \\xce\\xb1E\\xce\\xb2 \\xce\\xb1\\nj\\nE\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2\\nj+1 +\\nN\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\xce\\xb1,\\xce\\xb2=1\\n\\xce\\x93\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2\\n\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2E\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb1\\nj\\nE\\xce\\xb2 \\xce\\xb2\\nj+1\\n\\xef\\xa3\\xb6\\n\\xef\\xa3\\xb8,\\n(3)\\nwhere E\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2 are N \\xc3\\x97 N Wyel matrices with elements\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nE\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\ni,j = \\xce\\xb4\\xce\\xb1,i\\xce\\xb4\\xce\\xb2,j (\\xce\\xb1, \\xce\\xb2 = 1, ..., N). While the first term in the\\nright hand side of (3) acts over neighbour sites exchanging its configuration |\\xce\\xb1\\xe2\\x9f\\xa9\\xe2\\x8a\\x97|\\xce\\xb2\\xe2\\x9f\\xa9\\xe2\\x86\\x92|\\xce\\xb2\\xe2\\x9f\\xa9\\xe2\\x8a\\x97|\\xce\\xb1\\xe2\\x9f\\xa9with rate \\xce\\x93\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2\\n\\xce\\xb2 \\xce\\xb1, the\\nsecond one is a diagonal operator with weight \\xce\\x93\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2\\n\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2. The eigenfunction for (3) can be construct as\\n|O(\\xce\\xa8, N)\\xe2\\x9f\\xa9=\\n\\xe2\\x88\\x97\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\xce\\xb11,...,\\xce\\xb1L\\n\\xce\\xa8\\xce\\xb11...\\xce\\xb1L\\nN\\n|\\xce\\xb11, ..., \\xce\\xb1L\\xe2\\x9f\\xa9\\n(\\xce\\xb1j = 1, ..., N),\\n(4)\\nwhere the amplitudes \\xce\\xa8\\xce\\xb11...\\xce\\xb1L\\nN\\nare related to the amplitudes in (1), for the operator O, and the symbol (\\xe2\\x88\\x97) in the sum\\ndenotes the restriction to the sets {\\xce\\xb11, ..., \\xce\\xb1L} with the same number n\\xce\\xb1 of spins in configuration \\xce\\xb1.\\nTHE MPA\\nIn order to formulate a MPA for the Hamiltonian (3), we make a one-to-one correspondence between configurations\\nof spins (or scalar fields in the SYM) and products of abstract matrices.\\nThis matrix product is construct by\\nmaking a correspondence between sites with spin configuration \\xce\\xb1 = 1, ..., N and a matrix A(\\xce\\xb1). Our MPA asserts\\n5\\nthat the components of the amplitude of the eigenfunction \\xce\\xa8\\xce\\xb11...\\xce\\xb1L\\nN\\nin (4) are obtained by associating them to a\\nproducts of these matrices A(\\xce\\xb1). Actually A(\\xce\\xb1) (\\xce\\xb1 = 1, ..., N) are abstract operators with an associative product. A\\nwell defined eigenfunction is obtained, apart from a normalisation factor, if all the amplitudes are related uniquely.\\nEquivalently, in the subset of words (products of matrices) in the algebra containing n\\xce\\xb1 matrices A(\\xce\\xb1) (\\xce\\xb1 = 1, ..., N,\\nn1 + \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 nN = L) there exists only a single independent word. The relation between any two words gives the ratio\\nbetween the corresponding amplitudes of the components of the eigenfunction |O(\\xce\\xa8, N)\\xe2\\x9f\\xa9. To formulated the ansatz\\nwe can choose any uniform operation on the matrix products that gives a non-zero scalar. For a quantum chains with\\nperiodic boundary conditions the trace operation is a convenient chose to produce this scalar [47]. The amplitudes\\n\\xce\\xa8\\xce\\xb11...\\xce\\xb1L\\nN\\nin (4) takes the form:\\n\\xce\\xa8\\xce\\xb11...\\xce\\xb1L\\nN\\n= Tr(A(\\xce\\xb11)A(\\xce\\xb12) \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 A(\\xce\\xb1L))\\n(\\xce\\xb1j = 1, ..., N).\\n(5)\\nIt is obvious that the N states |\\xce\\xb1...\\xce\\xb1\\xe2\\x9f\\xa9(\\xce\\xb1 = 1, ..., N) are all eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (3). In the following we\\nshall choose |1...1\\xe2\\x9f\\xa9as our reference state. The Hamiltonian (3) when applied to the components of the eigenfunction\\n(4) where we do not have spins configurations |\\xce\\xb1\\xe2\\x9f\\xa9(\\xce\\xb1 = 2, ..., N) at nearest neighbour sites give us the constraints, for\\nthe amplitudes \\xce\\xa8\\xce\\xb11...\\xce\\xb1L\\nN\\n(5),\\n\\xce\\xb5nTr(Ax1\\xe2\\x88\\x921A(\\xce\\xb11)Ax2\\xe2\\x88\\x92x1\\xe2\\x88\\x921 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 A(\\xce\\xb1j\\xe2\\x88\\x921)Axj\\xe2\\x88\\x92xj\\xe2\\x88\\x921\\xe2\\x88\\x921A(\\xce\\xb1j)Axj+1\\xe2\\x88\\x92xj\\xe2\\x88\\x921A(\\xce\\xb1j+1) \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 A(\\xce\\xb1n)AL\\xe2\\x88\\x92xn)\\n=\\nn\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nj=1\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\xce\\x93\\xce\\xb1j 1\\n1 \\xce\\xb1jTr(Ax1\\xe2\\x88\\x921A(\\xce\\xb11)Ax2\\xe2\\x88\\x92x1\\xe2\\x88\\x921 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 A(\\xce\\xb1j\\xe2\\x88\\x921)Axj\\xe2\\x88\\x92xj\\xe2\\x88\\x921\\xe2\\x88\\x922A(\\xce\\xb1j)Axj+1\\xe2\\x88\\x92xjA(\\xce\\xb1j+1) \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 A(\\xce\\xb1n)AL\\xe2\\x88\\x92xn)\\n+ \\xce\\x931 \\xce\\xb1j\\n\\xce\\xb1j 1 Tr(Ax1\\xe2\\x88\\x921A(\\xce\\xb11)Ex2\\xe2\\x88\\x92x1\\xe2\\x88\\x921 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 A(\\xce\\xb1j\\xe2\\x88\\x921)Axj\\xe2\\x88\\x92xj\\xe2\\x88\\x921A(\\xce\\xb1j)Axj+1\\xe2\\x88\\x92xj\\xe2\\x88\\x922A(\\xce\\xb1j+1) \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 A(\\xce\\xb1n)AL\\xe2\\x88\\x92xn)\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n+[(L \\xe2\\x88\\x922n)\\xce\\x931 1\\n1 1 +\\nn\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\nl=1\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n\\xce\\x93\\xce\\xb1l 1\\n\\xce\\xb1l 1 + \\xce\\x931 \\xce\\xb1l\\n1 \\xce\\xb1l\\n\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\\n]Tr(Ax1\\xe2\\x88\\x921A(\\xce\\xb11)Ax2\\xe2\\x88\\x92x1\\xe2\\x88\\x921 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 A(\\xce\\xb1n)AL\\xe2\\x88\\x92xn)\\n(\\xce\\xb1j = 2, ..., N),\\n(6)\\nwhere \\xce\\xb5n is the energy of the eigenfunction (4), A \\xe2\\x89\\xa1A(1), n = n2 + n3 + \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 + nN, and x1, ..., xn are the position in\\nthe spin chain where we have a state configuration |\\xce\\xb1 \\xcc\\xb8= 1\\xe2\\x9f\\xa9. A convenient solution of this last equation is obtained by\\nidentifying the matrices A(\\xce\\xb1) (\\xce\\xb1 = 2, ..., N) as composed by spectral-parameter-dependent matrices [20, 21, 22]. The\\ndistinguibility of states configurations allows two types of solutions.

In this particular case the S-matrix is a\\ndiagonal matrix were S2 2\\n2 2(kj, kl) in (13) is the only nonzero element. As a consequence, the algebra defined by (12) is\\nassociative for N = 2. For N general the S-matrix is not diagonal and the algebra (12) is not associative for arbitrary\\nvalues of \\xce\\x93\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2\\n\\xce\\xb2 \\xce\\xb1 and \\xce\\x93\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2\\n\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2. For arbitrary amplitudes we have in our matrix product ansatz (5) a product of n matrices\\nA(\\xce\\xb1)\\nkj . Our ansatz will be valid only if the relations (12) provide a unique relation among these products, otherwise\\nthe eigenfunction (4) is not properly defined. This means, for example, that the products \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 A(\\xce\\xb1)\\nk1 A(\\xce\\xb2)\\nk2 A(\\xce\\xb3)\\nk3 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 and\\n\\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 A(\\xce\\xb3)\\nk3 A(\\xce\\xb2)\\nk2 A(\\xce\\xb1)\\nk1 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 \\xc2\\xb7 should be uniquely related.

This last constraint is just the Yang-Baxter relation [6, 42] of the S-matrix defined in\\n(13). Actually the condition (14) is enough to ensure that any matrix product of spectral matrices {A(\\xce\\xb1)\\nkj } is uniquely\\nrelated and it implies the associativity of the algebra of the matrices {A(\\xce\\xb1)\\nkj } . In this case the relations coming from the\\neigenvalue equation for configurations where we have more than two spins configurations |\\xce\\xb1\\xe2\\x9f\\xa9(\\xce\\xb1 = 2, ..., N) at nearest\\nneighbour sites are automatically satisfied by the algebraic relations (8) and (12) among the matrices defining the\\nansatz, no new constraints appear from these relations. On the other hand, the Yang-Baxter relation (14) produces\\nstrong constraints in the allowed couplings \\xce\\x93\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2\\n\\xce\\xb2 \\xce\\xb1 and \\xce\\x93\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2\\n\\xce\\xb1 \\xce\\xb2 of the Hamiltonian (3). In the sector N = 3 (tree types of\\nscalar fields \\xcf\\x861, \\xcf\\x862 and \\xcf\\x863, for example) the Hamiltonian (3) reduces to an asymmetric spin-1 quantum Hamiltonian\\nwith U(1)3 symmetry. The spin-1 model with g(2) = g(3) = 1 in (10) and U(1)3 symmetry was obtained by us in a\\nrecent work [21] in the context of condensed matter physics, but it is not studied with the objective of classifying all\\npossible solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation (14). In the generalised Lunin-Maldacena backgrounds, the solutions\\nof (14) was classified in [28] for hermitian Hamiltonians (3). In the present paper we obtain the most general solution\\nof (14). These solutions generalises the previous results obtained in [21, 28] and can be obtained by a systematic\\n8\\ninvestigation with the aid of Maple by purely analytical means.

According to this ansatz, the amplitudes of the eigenfunctions are given in\\nterms of a product of matrices where the matrices obey appropriated algebraic relations. This MPA is constructed\\nby making a one-to-one correspondence between configurations of spins (or scalar fields in the SYM) and products of\\nabstract matrices. Although in Lunin-Maldacena backgrounds all eigenstates have zero momentum, we can generalise\\nthe MPA including all momentum states [27]. We analyses the Yang-Baxter equation in the N = 3 sector and the\\nconsistence of the algebraic relations among the matrices defining the MPA and find a new class of exactly integrable\\nmodel unknown up to now (model B.2). This new model is a consequence of the distinguibility of states configurations\\ndue to the U(1)N symmetry. The study of this new model can be of interest in the context of both AdS/CFT and\\nstochastic process. MPA. On the other hand, it will be interesting to see if it is possible to formulate a MPA for\\nthe most general one-loop dilatation operator related with an integrable spin model with long-range couplings [39].\\nAnother quite interesting problem for the future concerns the formulation of the MPA for the case where we have\\nopen boundary conditions, as well as for quantum chains with no global conservation law such as the XYZ model, the\\n8-vertex model or the case where the quantum chains are defined on open lattices with non-diagonal boundary fields.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nI am grateful to F.

Looking at the degree 0 part of the stable Shalika germ expansion for the\\nmaximal torus TH in H (see the sentence just before Proposition 1 in [K8,\\np. 639]), we see that it is enough to show that SOtH(f H) = 0 for all G-regular\\ntH ∈TH(F) near γH. For this it is enough to show that elements tH near γH,\\nwhen viewed in T(F), are not stable norms from G(E), and this follows from\\nLemma A.3.4.\\n□\\nA.3.15\\nA correction to [K8]\\nIn the course of looking through section 2 of [K8] I noticed an error in the\\ndefinition of the Euler-Poincar´e function fEP . The sign character sgnσ occurring\\nin the definition of fEP should be defined as follows: sgnσ(g) is 1 if g preserves\\nthe orientation of the polysimplex σ, and it is −1 if g reverses that orientation.\\nWhen σ is a simplex, sgnσ(g) is just the sign of the permutation induced by\\ng on the vertices of σ. When writing [K8] I carelessly assumed that the same\\nis true for polysimplices, but this is in fact not the case even for the product\\nof two copies of a 1-simplex. Then there is a reflection (obviously orientation\\nreversing) that induces a permutation with cycle structure (12)(34) (obviously\\nan even permutation) on the four vertices of the square. This situation actually\\narises for the Euler-Poincar´e function on the group PGL2 × PGL2.\\nWith this corrected definition of the sign character, the formula sgnτ(γ) =\\n(−1)dim(τ)−dim(τ(γ)) used in the proof of Theorem 2 of [K8] becomes correct and\\nso no change is needed in that proof.\\nBibliography\\n[A1]\\nJ.

A Kirby diagram for Y = Σ(K6) and the plumbing graph for\\n−Y of Example 3.2.\\nthe plumbing W given by the graph on Figure 7. As before, for any symplectic filling X\\nof Y the union X ∪W is a negative-definite closed 4-manifold with the standard diagonal\\nintersection form. Up to changing the signs and the order of the vectors ei in the diagonal\\nbasis, there is a unique embedding of the lattice given by Figure 7 into ⟨−1⟩n, given by\\nv3 �→e1 + e2,\\nv1 �→−e1 −e3 + e5,\\nv2 �→−e1 + e3 + e4,\\nv4 �→−e2 + e6,\\nv5 �→−e6 + e7,\\nv6 �→−e7 + e8,\\nv7 �→−e8 + e9,\\nv8 �→−e9 + e10,\\nand thus the orthogonal complement of this lattice in ⟨−1⟩n is ⟨−9⟩⟨−3⟩⊕⟨−1⟩n−10. As in\\nthe previous example, the classification of tight contact structures on M(−1; 2/3, 1/2, 1/6)\\n[GLS] impies that our contact structure is isotopic to its conjugate, and so c1(X) = 0 for\\nany Stein filling. Since |H1(Y )| = 27, similar parity argument shows that b2(X) = 0, and\\nso d3 must be zero, a contradiction.\\nRemark 3.3. One can try to argue as in [GLS] to investigate symplectic fillability in\\nExamples 3.1 and 3.2: a slightly more involved agrument modulo 8 puts further restrictions\\non the value d3 for symplectic fillings (with diagonal odd intersection form). However, this\\ngives no obstruction to symplectic fillability of any contact structures in the above two\\nexamples.\\nIn the opposite direction, certain tight open books with the punctured torus page and\\npseudo-Anosov monodromy can be shown to be symplectically fillable as perturbations\\nKHOVANOV HOMOLOGY AND TIGHT CONTACT STRUCTURES\\n15\\nof taut foliations [HKM2]. We note that our examples are not pseudo-Anosov, so these\\nresults do not apply.\\nExample 3.4. A transverse representative of the mirror of 10130 with the maximal self-\\nlinking number is given by the braid σ−3\\n1 σ2σ2\\n1σ2\\n2σ3σ−1\\n2 σ3. We consider a family of trans-\\nverse braids\\nKr = σ−r\\n1 σ2σ2\\n1σ2\\n2σ3σ−1\\n2 σ3.\\nFirst, we check that all the underlying links are quasi-alternating. Resolve of the negative\\ncrossings among those given by σ−r\\n1\\nto obtain Kr−1 as one of the resolutions and the unknot\\nas the other. Observe that K0 is a two-component alternating link of det = 14 (with 52\\nknot and the unknot as components, linked once). Finally, compute | det(Kr)| = 14 + r\\n(one way to see this is to compute the size of H1 of the branched double cover of Kr which\\nis a Seifert fibered space shown on Figure 8).\\n+1\\nr unknots\\n−1\\n−1\\n+1\\n−1\\n−1\\n−2\\n−r\\n−2\\n−4\\nFigure 8. The surgery diagrams for the branched double covers of the\\ntransverse links Kr.\\nThe hypothesis of Corollary 1.3 holds: sl(Kr) = 2−r = σ −1. Therefore, the branched\\ndouble covers of the transverse links Kr are all tight.\\nWe do not investigate the fillability question in this case. (One can still try to use the\\nclassification of tight contact structures on these small Seifert fibered spaces, the fact they\\nare all L-spaces, and non-vanishing of d3 for some values of r, but the intersection form\\nfor the corresponding plumbings is harder to analyze.)\\nRemark 3.5. In Examples 3.1 and 3.2, transverse links are 3-braids, and the contact\\nstructures on the branched double covers can be given by open books whose page is a\\nonce-punctured torus. Tightness of these contact structures can be established by using\\nresults of [HKM1] or (easier yet) by rewriting the braids in the “standard” form and using\\nBaldwin’s work [Bal1]. Example 3.4 deals with 4-braids; the page of the corresponding\\nopen books is a twice-punctured torus, and known results do not apply.\\nRemark 3.6. In all of the above examples, we checked explicitly that our families of links\\nare quasi-alternating. In fact a weaker condition, rk KhZ/2(K) = | det(K)| is sufficient\\n16\\nOLGA PLAMENEVSKAYA\\nto ensure that the spectral sequence from Kh to �\\nHF collapses at the E2 stage. For any\\nindividual reasonably small knot this can be checked by a computer, for example using\\nBaldwin’s Kh program [Bal2] that computes the rank of reduced Khovanov homology with\\nZ/2 coefficients. Checking the second condition, sl(K) = s −1, is also routine for KhZ/2-\\nthin knots (alternatively, one can use the Trans program [Bal2] to check ψ ̸= 0). Thus\\ntightness of the contact structure on the branched double cover can be established by a\\ncomputer calculation.\\n+1 \\n−1\\n−1\\n−1\\nr zigzags\\nr unknots\\n−1\\n+1\\n−1\\n=\\n−1\\n−2\\n−r\\n−2\\nFigure 9. The surgery diagrams for the branched double covers of the\\ntransverse links of Example 3.7.\\nExample 3.7. John Baldwin has pointed out that for a family of (non-quasi-alternating)\\ntransverse 3-braids\\nKr = σ−r\\n1 σ2σ2\\n1σ2\\nfor r > 2 the transverse invariant ψ vanishes, but the contact structures on the branched\\ndouble covers are tight, and have c(ξ) ̸= 0. The vanishing of ψ can be established by\\nthe computer program [Bal2], while non-vanishing of the contact invariant follows from\\ncalculations in [HKM1] and [Bal1]. Obviously, Khovanov homology fails to detect tightness\\nin this case (so this is really a non-example), but it is interesting to take a look at the\\ncorresponding contact structures. They are given by surgery diagrams on Figure 9, and\\nare very similar to the contact structures from Example 3.1. As the latter are obtained\\nfrom the former by Legendrian surgery on a knot, the contact structures ξ(Kr) cannot be\\nStein fillable. As the underlying smooth manifold is M(−1; 1/2, 1/2, 1/r) carries a unique\\nStein non-fillable contact structure for each r, these contact structures are precisely those\\nconsidered in [GLS], where most of them are shown to be symplectically non-fillable.\\nKHOVANOV HOMOLOGY AND TIGHT CONTACT STRUCTURES\\n17\\nOne may wonder whether there is any relation between vanishing of ψ and symplectic\\nnon-fillability (although such relation seems quite improbable).\\nReferences\\n[APS]\\nM.

(13)\\nThe coefficients µζ and λζ,σ,q as well as the correspond-\\ning energy eigenvalues ℏωζ can be calculated though a\\nnumerical diagonalization of the matrix in Eq. (12). In\\nconclusion, the spectral function of the second subband\\nreads\\nA+\\n2 (k, ω) =\\n�\\nζ\\n|µζ|2δ(ω−ωζ)θ(k−kF )+δ(ω−ω2(k))θ(kF −k).\\n(14)\\nIn Fig.\\n2, we show numerical results using a vacuum\\nRabi frequency ΩR(qres) = |χ(qres)|\\n√\\nN = 0.1ω12. As it\\nappears from Eq.

Indeed, the pronounced\\ndip around ω = ω12 in the spectral function is a quantum\\ninterference feature, typical of a Fano resonance19.\\nAs we said before the sharp transition in Eq. 14 be-\\ntween k > kF and k < kF is only a consequence of the\\napproximations we made of neglecting the border of the\\nFermi sea and the effect of the temperature. In a real\\ncase both effects will tend to smooth the transition, the\\nfirst on an energy scale of the order of ℏ2kF qres\\nm∗\\nand the\\nsecond on an energy scale of KBT .\\nIV.\\nTUNNELING COUPLING, LOSSES AND\\nELECTROLUMINESCENCE\\nThe states |N + 1, k, 1, ζ⟩have been obtained by di-\\nagonalizing the Hamiltonian (1), which takes into ac-\\ncount only the coupling between the two-subband elec-\\ntronic system and the microcavity photon quantum field.\\nIf, as we have assumed, the light-matter interaction is\\nthe strongest one, all other residual couplings can be\\ntreated perturbatively.\\nThese residual interactions in-\\nclude the coupling to the extracavity fields, the interac-\\ntion with contacts, phonon and impurity scattering as\\nwell as Coulomb electron-electron interactions20.\\nThe states |N + 1, k, 1, ζ⟩can be excited for example\\nby resonant electron tunneling from a bulk injector or\\nan injection miniband. If V tc\\nk\\nis the tunneling coupling\\nmatrix element between the state |F⟩and c†\\n2,k|F⟩induced\\nby the coupling with the injector we have, using the Fermi\\ngolden rule, the following injection rate:\\nΓinj(k, ζ) = 2π\\nℏ|µζ|2|V tc\\nk |2ρinj(ωζ)nF (ωζ),\\n(15)\\nwhere ρinj(ω) is the density of electronic states in-\\nside the contact and nf(ω) its Fermi distribution.\\nρinj(ω)nf(ω) determines the spectral shape of the injec-\\ntor. µζ comes from Eq.

In the broadband case, the emission is\\nresonant at the intersubband cavity polariton frequen-\\ncies (dashed lines) and it is significant in a wide range of\\nin-plane wavectors16. In contrast, in the case of narrow-\\nband electrical injector our theory shows that the photon\\nin-plane momentum and the energy of the cavity polari-\\nton emission can be selected by the resonant electron\\ntunneling process, in agreement with what suggested by\\nrecent experiments14.\\nIn free-space, the quantum efficiency of electrolumi-\\nnescent devices based on intersubband transitions is poor\\n(≈10−5 in the mid-infrared) due to the slow radiative re-\\ncombination of long wavelength transitions. In the micro-\\ncavity case, the efficiency of the emission from an excited\\nstate |N +1, k, 1, ζ⟩is given by (1+τr,k,ζ/τnr,k,ζ)−1. Be-\\ning 1/τnr,k,ζ essentially proportional to the matter com-\\nponent of the excitation and 1/τr,k,ζ to its photonic frac-\\ntion, we have found that it is possible to obtain a quan-\\ntum efficiency approaching unity by selectively injecting\\nelectrons into dressed states with a high photonic frac-\\ntion. In particular, this is achievable by avoiding injec-\\ntion resonant with the central peak of the electron spec-\\ntral function in Fig.2, which corresponds to states with\\nstrong overlap with the bare electron state.\\nIn the present theory, we have not considered the role\\nof electronic disorder, which is known to break the in-\\nplane translational invariance. However, in the limit of\\nlarge vacuum Rabi energies (i.e., significantly larger than\\nthe energy scale of the disorder potential), the inhomoge-\\nnous broadening is expected to have a perturbative role.\\nLet us point out clearly that in order to achieve a high\\nquantum efficiency, it is necessary to have a considerably\\nnarrow spectral width for the injector, on the order of a\\nsmall fraction (10−2) of the intersubband transition en-\\nergy ℏω12. This is essential in order to be able to inject\\nelectrons selectively into the superradiant states, while\\navoiding both the peak associated to the dark excitations\\nat the bare electron energy and the states with k < kF\\nthat can not radiatively decay. In the experiments in Ref.\\n14, the spectral width of the injector (a heavily doped su-\\nperlattice) is comparable to the polariton vacuum Rabi\\nfrequency and hence such selective excitations of the su-\\nperradiant states cannot be reached. In order to have\\nan injector with narrower spectral width, several elec-\\ntronic designs could be implemented. For example, one\\ncan grow a ”filter” quantum well between the superlattice\\ninjector and the active quantum well: resonant electron\\ntunneling through the intermediate quantum well can sig-\\nnificantly enhance the resonant character of the excita-\\ntion. Moreover, for a given injector, improved microcav-\\nity samples with larger vacuum Rabi frequency would\\nallow the system a more resonant excitation of the su-\\nperradiant electronic states.\\nV.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nIn\\nconclusion,\\nwe\\nhave\\ndetermined\\nin\\na\\nnon-\\nperturbative\\nway\\nthe\\nquasi-electron\\nstates\\nin\\na\\nmicrocavity-embedded\\ntwo-dimensional\\nelectron\\ngas.\\nSuch states originate from a Fano-like coupling between\\nthe bare electron state and the continuum of cavity po-\\nlariton excitations.\\nWe have proven that these states\\ncan be selectively excited by resonant electron tunneling\\nand that the use of narrow-band injector may give rise\\nto efficient intersubband polariton electroluminescence.\\nOur theoretical work shows that the strong coupling to\\nthe vacuum electromagnetic field can modify significantly\\nthe fundamental electron injection processes.\\n8\\nVI.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nqWe thanks Iacopo Carusotto, Raffaele Colombelli, Al-\\nberto Santagostino, Luca Sapienza, Carlo Sirtori, Yanko\\nTodorov and Angela Vasanelli for discussions.\\n1 Y.

Priebe, & John C. Wierman\\nJohns Hopkins University, Baltimore\\nJune 21, 2013\\nAbstract\\nStatistical pattern classification methods based on data-random graphs were introduced recently. In\\nthis approach, a random directed graph is constructed from the data using the relative positions of the\\ndata points from various classes. Different random graphs result from different definitions of the prox-\\nimity region associated with each data point and different graph statistics can be employed for data\\nreduction.\\nThe approach used in this article is based on a parameterized family of proximity maps\\ndetermining an associated family of data-random digraphs. The relative arc density of the digraph is\\nused as the summary statistic, providing an alternative to the domination number employed previously.\\nAn important advantage of the relative arc density is that, properly re-scaled, it is a U-statistic, facili-\\ntating analytic study of its asymptotic distribution using standard U-statistic central limit theory. The\\napproach is illustrated with an application to the testing of spatial patterns of segregation and associa-\\ntion. Knowledge of the asymptotic distribution allows evaluation of the Pitman and Hodges-Lehmann\\nasymptotic efficacies, and selection of the proximity map parameter to optimize efficiency. Furthermore\\nthe approach presented here also has the advantage of validity for data in any dimension.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nClassification and clustering have received considerable attention in the statistical literature. In recent years,\\na new classification approach has been developed which is based on the relative positions of the data points\\nfrom various classes. Priebe et al. introduced the class cover catch digraphs (CCCD) in R and gave the exact\\nand the asymptotic distribution of the domination number of the CCCD Priebe et al. (2001). DeVinney et\\nal. DeVinney et al. (2002), Marchette and Priebe Marchette and Priebe (2003), Priebe et al. Priebe et al.\\n(2003b), Priebe et al. (2003a) applied the concept in higher dimensions and demonstrated relatively good\\nperformance of CCCD in classification. The methods employed involve data reduction (condensing) by using\\napproximate minimum dominating sets as prototype sets (since finding the exact minimum dominating set\\nis an NP-hard problem —in particular for CCCD). Furthermore the exact and the asymptotic distribution\\nof the domination number of the CCCD are not analytically tractable in multiple dimensions.\\nCeyhan and Priebe introduced the central similarity proximity map and r-factor proximity maps and the\\nassociated random digraphs in Ceyhan and Priebe (2003a) and Ceyhan and Priebe (2003b), respectively. In\\nboth cases, the space is partitioned by the Delaunay tessellation which is the Delaunay triangulation in R2.\\nIn each triangle, a family of data-random proximity catch digraphs is constructed based on the proximity of\\nthe points to each other. The advantages of the r-factor proximity catch digraphs are that an exact minimum\\ndominating set can be found in polynomial time and the asymptotic distribution of the domination number\\nis analytically tractable. The latter is then used to test segregation and association of points of different\\nclasses in Ceyhan and Priebe (2003b). Segregation and assocation are two patterns that describe the spatial\\nrelation between two or more classes. See Section 2.5 for more detail.\\nDRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  \\nIn this article, we employ a different statistic, namely the relative (arc) density, that is the proportion\\nof all possible arcs (directed edges) which are present in the data random digraph. This test statistic has\\nthe advantage that, properly rescaled, it is a U-statistic. Two plain classes of alternative hypotheses, for\\nsegregation and association, are defined in Section 2.5. The asymptotic distributions under both the null and\\nthe alternative hypotheses are determined in Section 3 by using standard U-statistic central limit theory.\\nPitman and Hodges-Lehman asymptotic efficacies are analyzed in Sections 4.3 and 4.4, respectively. This\\ntest is related to the available tests of segregation and association in the ecology literature, such as Pielou’s\\ntest and Ripley’s test. See discussion in Section 6 for more detail. Our approach is valid for data in any\\ndimension, but for simplicity of expression and visualization, will be described for two-dimensional data.\\n2\\nPreliminaries\\n2.1\\nProximity Maps\\nLet (Ω, M) be a measurable space and consider a function N : Ω× 2Ω→2Ω, where 2Ωrepresents the power\\nset of Ω. Then given Y ⊆Ω, the proximity map NY(·) = N(·, Y) : Ω→℘(Ω) associates with each point\\nx ∈Ωa proximity region NY(x) ⊂Ω. Typically, N is chosen to satisfy x ∈NY(x) for all x ∈Ω. The use of\\nthe adjective proximity comes form thinking of the region NY(x) as representing a neighborhood of points\\n“close” to x. (Jaromczyk and Toussaint (1992); Toussaint (1980).)\\n2.2\\nr-Factor Proximity Maps\\nWe now briefly define r-factor proximity maps. (See Ceyhan and Priebe Ceyhan and Priebe (2003b) for\\nmore details). Let Ω= R2 and let Y = {y1, y2, y3} ⊂R2 be three non-collinear points. Denote by T (Y)\\nthe triangle —including the interior— formed by the three points (i.e. T (Y) is the convex hull of Y). For\\nr ∈[1, ∞], define N r\\nY to be the r-factor proximity map as follows; see also Figure 1. Using line segments\\nfrom the center of mass (centroid) of T (Y) to the midpoints of its edges, we partition T (Y) into “vertex\\nregions” R(y1), R(y2), and R(y3). For x ∈T (Y) \\\\ Y, let v(x) ∈Y be the vertex in whose region x falls,\\nso x ∈R(v(x)). If x falls on the boundary of two vertex regions, we assign v(x) arbitrarily to one of the\\nadjacent regions. Let e(x) be the edge of T (Y) opposite v(x). Let ℓ(x) be the line parallel to e(x) through\\nx. Let d(v(x), ℓ(x)) be the Euclidean (perpendicular) distance from v(x) to ℓ(x). For r ∈[1, ∞), let ℓr(x)\\nbe the line parallel to e(x) such that d(v(x), ℓr(x)) = rd(v(x), ℓ(x)) and d(ℓ(x), ℓr(x)) < d(v(x), ℓr(x)). Let\\nTr(x) be the triangle similar to and with the same orientation as T (Y) having v(x) as a vertex and ℓr(x) as\\nthe opposite edge. Then the r-factor proximity region N r\\nY(x) is defined to be Tr(x)∩T (Y). Notice that r ≥1\\nimplies x ∈N r\\nY(x). Note also that limr→∞N r\\nY(x) = T (Y) for all x ∈T (Y) \\\\ Y, so we define N ∞\\nY (x) = T (Y)\\nfor all such x. For x ∈Y, we define N r\\nY(x) = {x} for all r ∈[1, ∞].\\n2.3\\nData-Random Proximity Catch Digraphs\\nIf Xn := {X1, X2, · · · , Xn} is a set of Ω-valued random variables, then the NY(Xi), i = 1, · · · , n, are random\\nsets. If the Xi are independent and identically distributed, then so are the random sets NY(Xi).\\nIn the case of an r-factor proximity map, notice that if Xi\\niid\\n∼F and F has a non-degenerate two-\\ndimensional probability density function f with support(f) ⊆T (Y), then the special case in the construction\\nof N r\\nY — X falls on the boundary of two vertex regions — occurs with probability zero.\\nThe proximities of the data points to each other are used to construct a digraph.\\nA digraph is a\\ndirected graph; i.e. a graph with directed edges from one vertex to another based on a binary relation.\\nDefine the data-random proximity catch digraph D with vertex set V = {X1, · · · , Xn} and arc set A by\\n(Xi, Xj) ∈A ⇐⇒Xj ∈NY(Xi). Since this relationship is not symmetric, a digraph is needed rather than\\nDRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  \\ne(x)\\nℓ(x)\\ny3\\ny2\\nR(y1)\\nR(y3)\\nR(y2)\\nℓ2(x)\\nd(v(x), ℓ(x))\\ny1 = v(x)\\nx\\nd(v(x), ℓ2(x)) = 2 d(v(x), ℓ(x))\\nFigure 1: Construction of r-factor proximity region, N 2\\nY(x) (shaded region).\\na graph. The random digraph D depends on the (joint) distribution of the Xi and on the map NY.\\n2.4\\nRelative Density\\nThe relative arc density of a digraph D = (V, A) of order |V| = n, denoted ρ(D), is defined as\\nρ(D) =\\n|A|\\nn(n −1)\\nwhere | · | denotes the set cardinality functional Janson et al. (2000).\\nThus ρ(D) represents the ratio of the number of arcs in the digraph D to the number of arcs in the\\ncomplete symmetric digraph of order n, which is n(n −1). For brevity of notation we use relative density\\nrather than relative arc density henceforth.\\nIf X1, · · · , Xn\\niid\\n∼F the relative density of the associated data-random proximity catch digraph D, denoted\\nρ(Xn; h, NY), is a U-statistic,\\nρ(Xn; h, NY) =\\n1\\nn(n −1)\\n��\\ni<j\\nh(Xi, Xj; NY)\\n(1)\\nwhere\\nh(Xi, Xj; NY)\\n=\\nI{(Xi, Xj) ∈A} + I{(Xj, Xi) ∈A}\\n=\\nI{Xj ∈NY(Xi)} + I{Xi ∈NY(Xj)},\\n(2)\\nwhere I(·) is the indicator function. We denote h(Xi, Xj; NY) as hij for brevity of notation. Although the\\ndigraph is asymmetric, hij is defined as the number of arcs in D between vertices Xi and Xj, in order to\\nproduce a symmetric kernel with finite variance Lehmann (1988).\\nThe random variable ρn := ρ(Xn; h, NY) depends on n and NY explicitly and on F implicitly.\\nThe\\nexpectation E [ρn], however, is independent of n and depends on only F and NY:\\n0 ≤E [ρn] = 1\\n2E [h12] ≤1 for all n ≥2.\\n(3)\\nDRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  \\nThe variance Var [ρn] simplifies to\\n0 ≤Var [ρn] =\\n1\\n2n(n −1)Var [h12] +\\nn −2\\nn(n −1)Cov [h12, h13] ≤1/4.\\n(4)\\nA central limit theorem for U-statistics Lehmann (1988) yields\\n√n\\n�\\nρn −E [ρn]\\n�\\nL\\n−→N\\n�\\n0, Cov [h12, h13]\\n�\\n(5)\\nprovided Cov [h12, h13] > 0.

For instance, it may be the case that one type of plant does\\nnot grow well in the vicinity of another type of plant, and vice versa. This implies, in our notation, that Xi\\nare unlikely to be located near any elements of Y. Alternatively, association occurs when members of one\\nclass have a tendency to attract members of the other class, as in symbiotic species, so that the Xi will tend\\nto cluster around the elements of Y, for example. See, for instance, Dixon (1994), Coomes et al. (1999). The\\nnull hypothesis for spatial patterns have been a contraversial topic in ecology from the early days. Gotelli\\nand Graves Gotelli and Graves (1996) have collected a voluminous literature to present a comprehensive\\nanalysis of the use and misuse of null models in ecology community. They also define and attempt to clarify\\nthe null model concept as “a pattern-generating model that is based on randomization of ecological data or\\nrandom sampling from a known or imagined distribution. . . . The randomization is designed to produce\\na pattern that would be expected in the absence of a particular ecological mechanism.” In other words, the\\nhypothesized null models can be viewed as“thought experiments,” which is conventially used in the physical\\nsciences, and these models provide a statistical baseline for the analysis of the patterns. For statistical testing\\nfor segregation and association, the null hypothesis we consider is a type of complete spatial randomness;\\nthat is,\\nH0 : Xi\\niid\\n∼U(T (Y))\\nwhere U(T (Y)) is the uniform distribution on T (Y). If it is desired to have the sample size be a random\\nvariable, we may consider a spatial Poisson point process on T (Y) as our null hypothesis.\\nWe define two classes of alternatives, HS\\nǫ and HA\\nǫ with ǫ ∈\\n�\\n0,\\n√\\n3/3\\n�\\n, for segregation and association,\\nrespectively. For y ∈Y, let e(y) denote the edge of T (Y) opposite vertex y, and for x ∈T (Y) let ℓy(x) denote\\nthe line parallel to e(y) through x. Then define T (y, ǫ) =\\n�\\nx ∈T (Y) : d(y, ℓy(x)) ≤ǫ\\n�\\n. Let HS\\nǫ be the model\\nunder which Xi\\niid\\n∼U\\n�\\nT (Y) \\\\ ∪y∈YT (y, ǫ)\\n�\\nand HA\\nǫ be the model under which Xi\\niid\\n∼U\\n�\\n∪y∈YT (y,\\n√\\n3/3 −ǫ)\\n�\\n.\\nThus the segregation model excludes the possibility of any Xi occurring near a yj, and the association model\\nrequires that all Xi occur near a yj. The\\n√\\n3/3 −ǫ in the definition of the association alternative is so that\\nǫ = 0 yields H0 under both classes of alternatives.\\nRemark: These definitions of the alternatives are given for the standard equilateral triangle.\\nThe\\ngeometry invariance result of Theorem 1 from Section 3 still holds under the alternatives, in the following\\nsense. If, in an arbitrary triangle, a small percentage δ ·100% where δ ∈(0, 4/9) of the area is carved away as\\nforbidden from each vertex using line segments parallel to the opposite edge, then under the transformation to\\nthe standard equilateral triangle this will result in the alternative HS√\\n3δ/4. This argument is for segregation\\nwith δ < 1/4; a similar construction is available for the other cases.\\nDRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  \\n3\\nAsymptotic Normality Under the Null and Alternative Hy-\\npotheses\\nFirst we present a “geometry invariance” result which allows us to assume T (Y) is the standard equilateral\\ntriangle, T\\n�\\n(0, 0), (1, 0),\\n�\\n1/2,\\n√\\n3/2\\n��\\n, thereby simplifying our subsequent analysis.\\nTheorem 1: Let Y = {y1, y2, y3} ⊂R2 be three non-collinear points.\\nFor i = 1, · · · , n let Xi\\niid\\n∼\\nF = U(T (Y)), the uniform distribution on the triangle T (Y). Then for any r ∈[1, ∞] the distribution of\\nρ(Xn; h, N r\\nY) is independent of Y, hence the geometry of T (Y).\\nProof: A composition of translation, rotation, reflections, and scaling will transform any given trian-\\ngle To = T\\n�\\ny1, y2, y3\\n�\\ninto the “basic” triangle Tb = T\\n�\\n(0, 0), (1, 0), (c1, c2)\\n�\\nwith 0 < c1 ≤1/2, c2 > 0\\nand (1 −c1)2 + c2\\n2 ≤1, preserving uniformity.\\nThe transformation φe : R2 →R2 given by φe(u, v) =\\n�\\nu + 1−2 c1\\n√\\n3\\nv,\\n√\\n3\\n2 c2 v\\n�\\ntakes Tb to the equilateral triangle Te = T\\n�\\n(0, 0), (1, 0),\\n�\\n1/2,\\n√\\n3/2\\n��\\n. Investigation of\\nthe Jacobian shows that φe also preserves uniformity. Furthermore, the composition of φe with the rigid\\nmotion transformations maps the boundary of the original triangle To to the boundary of the equilateral\\ntriangle Te, the median lines of To to the median lines of Te, and lines parallel to the edges of To to lines\\nparallel to the edges of Te. Since the joint distribution of any collection of the hij involves only probability\\ncontent of unions and intersections of regions bounded by precisely such lines, and the probability content\\nof such regions is preserved since uniformity is preserved, the desired result follows. ■\\nBased on Theorem 1 and our uniform null hypothesis, we may assume that T (Y) is the standard equi-\\nlateral triangle with Y =\\n�\\n(0, 0), (1, 0),\\n�\\n1/2,\\n√\\n3/2\\n��\\nhenceforth.\\nFor our r-factor proximity map and uniform null hypothesis, the asymptotic null distribution of ρn(r) =\\nρ(Xn; h, N r\\nY) can be derived as a function of r. Let µ(r) := E [ρn(r)] and ν(r) := Cov [h12, h13]. Notice that\\nµ(r) = E [h12]/2 = P(X2 ∈N r\\nY(X1)) is the probability of an arc occurring between any pair of vertices.\\n3.1\\nAsymptotic Normality under the Null Hypothesis\\nBy detailed geometric probability calculations, provided in Appendix 1, the mean and the asymptotic vari-\\nance of the relative density of the r-factor proximity catch digraph can explicitly be computed.

The mean µS(r, ǫ) = E ǫ[ρn(r)] = E ǫ[h12]/2 (and µA(r, ǫ)), now a function\\nof both r and ǫ, is again in [0, 1]. The asymptotic variance νS(r, ǫ) = Cov ǫ[h12, h13] (and νA(r, ǫ)), also a\\nfunction of both r and ǫ, is bounded above by 1/4, as before. The explicit forms of µS(r, ǫ) and µA(r, ǫ) is\\ngiven, defined piecewise, in Appendix 2. Sample values of µS(r, ǫ), νS(r, ǫ) and µA(r, ǫ), νA(r, ǫ) are given in\\nAppendix 3 for segregation with ǫ =\\n√\\n3/4 and for association with ǫ =\\n√\\n3/12. Thus asymptotic normality\\nobtains provided νS(r, ǫ) > 0 (νA(r, ǫ) > 0); otherwise ρn(r) is degenerate.

Using the test statistic\\nR =\\n√n(ρn(r) −µ(r))\\n�\\nν(r)\\n,\\n(10)\\nthe asymptotic critical value for the one-sided level α test against segregation is given by\\nzα = Φ−1(1 −α)\\n(11)\\nwhere Φ(·) is the standard normal distribution function. Against segregation, the test rejects for R > z1−α\\nand against association, the test rejects for R < zα.\\n4.1\\nConsistency\\nTheorem 4: The test against HS\\nǫ which rejects for R > z1−α and the test against HA\\nǫ which rejects for\\nR < zα are consistent for r ∈[1, ∞) and ǫ ∈\\n�\\n0,\\n√\\n3/3\\n�\\n.\\nProof: Since the variance of the asymptotically normal test statistic, under both the null and the\\nalternatives, converges to 0 as n →∞(or is degenerate), it remains to show that the mean under the null,\\nµ(r) = E [ρn(r)], is less than (greater than) the mean under the alternative, µS(r, ǫ) = Eǫ[ρn(r)] (µA(r, ǫ))\\nagainst segregation (association) for ǫ > 0. Whence it will follow that power converges to 1 as n →∞.\\nDetailed analysis of µS(r, ǫ) and µA(r, ǫ) in Appendix 2 indicates that under segregation µS(r, ǫ) > µ(r)\\nfor all ǫ > 0 and r ∈[1, ∞). Likewise, detailed analysis of µA(r, ǫ) in Appendix 3 indicates that under\\nassociation µA(r, ǫ) < µ(r) for all ǫ > 0 and r ∈[1, ∞). Hence the desired result follows for both alternatives.\\n■\\nIn fact, the analysis of µ(r, ǫ) under the alternatives reveals more than what is required for consistency.\\nUnder segregation, the analysis indicates that µS(r, ǫ1) < µS(r, ǫ2) for ǫ1 < ǫ2. Likewise, under association,\\nthe analysis indicates that µA(r, ǫ1) > µA(r, ǫ2) for ǫ1 < ǫ2.\\nDRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  \\n4.2\\nMonte Carlo Power Analysis\\n0.10\\n0.15\\n0.20\\n0.25\\n0.30\\n0.35\\n0.40\\n0.45\\n0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\n8\\n10\\n \\nkernel density estimate\\nrelative density\\n0.18\\n0.20\\n0.22\\n0.24\\n0.26\\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n \\nkernel density estimate\\nrelative density\\nFigure 5:\\nTwo Monte Carlo experiments against the segregation alternative HS\\n√\\n3/8.

With n = 100, there is more separation between null and alternative probability\\ndensity functions; for this case, 1000 Monte Carlo replicates yield �βS\\nmc = 0.77. Notice also that the probability\\ndensity functions are more skewed for n = 10, while approximate normality holds for n = 100.\\nFor a given alternative and sample size, we may consider analyzing the power of the test — using the\\nasymptotic critical value— as a function of the proximity factor r.

Consider the Delaunay triangulation (assumed\\nto exist) of Y, where Tj denotes the jth Delaunay triangle, J denotes the number of triangles, and CH(Y)\\ndenotes the convex hull of Y. We wish to test H0 : Xi\\niid\\n∼U(CH(Y)) against segregation and association\\nalternatives.\\nThe digraph D is constructed using N r\\nYj(·) as described in Section 2.3, where for Xi ∈Tj the three points\\nin Y defining the Delaunay triangle Tj are used as Yj. Let ρn(r, J) be the relative density of the digraph\\nbased on Xn and Y which yields J Delaunay triangles, and let wj := A(Tj)/A(CH(Y)) for j = 1, . . . , J,\\nwhere A(CH(Y)) = �J\\nj=1 A(Tj) with A(·) being the area functional. Then we obtain the following as a\\ncorollary to Theorem 2.\\nCorollary 1: The asymptotic null distribution for ρn(r, J) conditional on W = {w1, . . . , wJ} for r ∈\\n[1, ∞] is given by N(µ(r, J), ν(r, J)/n) provided that ν(r, J) > 0 with\\nµ(r, J) := µ(r)\\nJ\\n�\\nj=1\\nw2\\nj , and ν(r, J) := ν(r)\\nJ\\n�\\nj=1\\nw3\\nj + 4µ(r)2\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8ef\\uf8f0\\nJ\\n�\\nj=1\\nw3\\nj −\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed\\nJ\\n�\\nj=1\\nw2\\nj\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\n2\\uf8f9\\n\\uf8fa\\uf8fb,\\n(12)\\nwhere µ(r) and ν(r) are given by equations (8) and (9), respectively.\\nProof: See Appendix 4. ■\\nBy an appropriate application of Jensen’s Inequality, we see that �J\\nj=1 w3\\nj ≥\\n��J\\nj=1 w2\\nj\\n�2. Therefore,\\nν(r, J) = 0 iff ν(r) = 0 and �J\\nj=1 w3\\nj =\\n��J\\nj=1 w2\\nj\\n�2, so asymptotic normality may hold even when ν(r) = 0.\\nSimilarly, for the segregation (association) alternatives with 4 ǫ2/3 × 100% of the triangles around the\\nvertices of each triangle is forbidden (allowed), we obtain the above asymptotic distribution of ρn(r) with\\nµ(r) being replaced by µS(r, ǫ), ν(r) by νS(r, ǫ), µ(r, J), by µS(r, J, ǫ), and ν(r, J) by νS(r, J, ǫ). Likewise\\nfor association.\\nThus in the case of J > 1, we have a (conditional) test of H0 : Xi\\niid\\n∼U(CH(Y)) which once again rejects\\nagainst segregation for large values of ρn(r, J) and rejects against association for small values of ρn(r, J).\\nDepicted in Figure 13 are the segregation (with δ = 1/16 i.e. ǫ =\\n√\\n3/8), null, and association (with\\nδ = 1/4 i.e. ǫ =\\n√\\n3/12) realizations (from left to right) with n = 1000, |Y| = 10, and J = 13. For the\\nnull realization, the p-value is greater than 0.1 for all r values and both alternatives. For the segregation\\nrealization, we obtain p < 0.0031 for 1 < r ≤5 and p > 0.24 for r = 1 and r ≥10. For the association\\nrealization, we obtain p < 0.0135 for 1 < r ≤3, p = .14 for r = 1, and p > 0.25 for for r ≥5.

The smallest empirical\\nsignificance levels and highest empirical power estimates occur at moderate r values (r = 3/2, 2, 3) against\\nsegregation and at smaller r values (r =\\n√\\n2, 3/2) against association. Based on this analysis, for the given\\nrealization of Y, we suggest the use of moderate r values for segregation and slightly smaller for association.\\nNotice also that as n increases, the empirical power estimates gets larger for both alternatives.\\nThe conditional test presented here is appropriate when the W are fixed, not random.

A slight variation of NS is the\\narc-slice proximity map NAS(x) := B(x, r(x)) ∩T (x) where T (x) is the Delaunay cell that contains x (see\\nCeyhan and Priebe (2003a)). Furthermore, Ceyhan and Priebe introduced the central similarity proximity\\nmap NCS in Ceyhan and Priebe (2003a) and N r\\nY in Ceyhan and Priebe (2003b). The r-factor proximity\\nmap, when compared to the others, has the advantages that the asymptotic distribution of the domination\\nnumber γn(N r\\nY) is tractable (see Ceyhan and Priebe (2003b)), an exact minimum dominating set can be\\nfound in polynomial time. Moreover N r\\nY and NCS are geometry invariant for uniform data over triangles.\\nAdditionally, the mean and variance of relative density ρn is not analytically tractable for NS and NAS.\\nWhile N r\\nY(x), NCS(x), and NAS(x) are well defined only for x ∈CH(Y), the convex hull of Y, NS(x) is well\\ndefined for all x ∈Rd. The proximity maps NS and NAS require no effort to extend to higher dimensions.\\nThe NS (the proximity map associated with CCCD) is used in classification in the literature, but not\\nfor testing spatial patterns between two or more classes.\\nWe develop a technique to test the patterns\\nof segregation or association. There are many tests available for segregation and association in ecology\\nliterature. See Dixon (1994) for a survey on these tests and relevant references. Two of the most commonly\\nused tests are Pielou’s χ2 test of independence and Ripley’s test based on K(t) and L(t) functions. However,\\nthe test we introduce here is not comparable to either of them. Our test is a conditional test — conditional on\\nDRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  \\na realization of J (number of Delaunay triangles) and W (the set of relative areas of the Delaunay triangles)\\nand we require the number of triangles J is fixed and relatively small compared to n = |Xn|. Furthermore,\\nour method deals with a slightly different type of data than most methods to examine spatial patterns. The\\nsample size for one type of point (type X points) is much larger compared to the the other (type Y points).\\nThis implies that in practice, Y could be stationary or have much longer life span than members of X. For\\nexample, a special type of fungi might constitute X points, while the tree species around which the fungi\\ngrow might be viewed as the Y points.\\nThere are two major types of asymptotic structures for spatial data Lahiri (1996). In the first, any two\\nobservations are required to be at least a fixed distance apart, hence as the number of observations increase,\\nthe region on which the process is observed eventually becomes unbounded. This type of sampling structure\\nis called “increasing domain asymptotics”. In the second type, the region of interest is a fixed bounded\\nregion and more or more points are observed in this region. Hence the minimum distance between data\\npoints tends to zero as the sample size tends to infinity. This type of structure is called “infill asymptotics”,\\ndue to Cressie Cressie (1991). The sampling structure for our asymptotic analysis is infill, as only the size\\nof the type X process tends to infinity, while the support, the convex hull of a given set of points from type\\nY process, CH(Y) is a fixed bounded region.\\nMoreover, our statistic that can be written as a U-statistic based on the locations of type X points with\\nrespect to type Y points. This is one advantage of the proposed method: most statistics for spatial patterns\\ncan not be written as U-statistics. The U-statistic form avails us the asymptotic normality, once the mean\\nand variance is obtained by tedious detailed geometric calculations.\\nThe null hypothesis we consider is considerably more restrictive than current approaches, which can be\\nused much more generally. The null hypothesis for testing segregation or association can be described in two\\nslightly different forms Dixon (1994):\\n(i) complete spatial randomness, that is, each class is distributed randomly throughout the area of interest.\\nIt describes both the arrangement of the locations and the association between classes.\\n(ii) random labeling of locations, which is less restrictive than spatial randomness, in the sense that ar-\\nrangement of the locations can either be random or non-random.\\nOur conditional test is closer to the former in this regard. Pielou’s test provide insight only on the association\\nbetween classes, hence there is no assumption on the allocation of the observations, which makes it more\\nappropriate for testing the null hypothesis of random labeling. Ripley’s test can be used for both types of\\nnull hypotheses, in particular, it can be used to test a type of spatial randomness against another type of\\nspatial randomness.\\nThe test based on the mean domination number in Ceyhan and Priebe (2003b) is not a conditional test,\\nbut requires both n and number of Delaunay triangles J to be large. The comparison for a large but fixed J\\nis possible. Furthermore, under segregation alternatives, the Pitman asymptotic efficiency is not applicable\\nto the mean domination number case, however, for large n and J we suggest the use of it over arc density\\nsince for each ǫ > 0, Hodges-Lehmann asymptotic efficiency is unbounded for the mean domination number\\ncase, while it is bounded for arc density case with J > 1. As for the association alternative, HLAE suggests\\nmoderate r values which has finite Hodges-Lehmann asymptotic efficiency. So again, for large J and n mean\\ndomination number is preferable. The basic advantage of ρn(r) is that, it does not require J to be large, so\\nfor small J it is preferable.\\nAlthough the statistical analysis and the mathematical properties related to the r-factor proximity catch\\ndigraph are done in R2, the extension to Rd with d > 2 is straightforward.\\nSee Ceyhan and Priebe\\nCeyhan and Priebe (2003b) for more detail on the construction of the associated proximity region in higher\\ndimensions. Moreover, the geometry invariance, asymptotic normality of the U-statistic and consistency of\\nthe tests hold for d > 2.\\nDRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  DRAFT  --  \\nReferences\\nCeyhan, E. and Priebe, C.
